[{"num":5,"verse":"I am come into my garden, my sister, [my] spouse; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, beloved ones!"},{"num":2,"verse":"I slept, but my heart was awake. The voice of my beloved! he knocketh: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, mine undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night."},{"num":3,"verse":"—I have put off my tunic, how should I put it on? I have washed my feet, how should I pollute them?—"},{"num":4,"verse":"My beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door]; And my bowels yearned for him."},{"num":5,"verse":"I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the lock."},{"num":6,"verse":"I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself; he was gone: My soul went forth when he spoke. I sought him, but I found him not; I called him, but he gave me no answer."},{"num":7,"verse":"The watchmen that went about the city found me; They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my veil from me."},{"num":8,"verse":"I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, … What will ye tell him?—That I am sick of love."},{"num":9,"verse":"What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, Thou fairest among women?
