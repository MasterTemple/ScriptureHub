Then you will be perfect and complete. You will have everything you need. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But if any of you needs wisdom, you should ask God for it. God is generous. He enjoys giving to all people, so God will give you wisdom. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But when you ask God, you must believe. Do not doubt God. Anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea. The wind blows the wave up and down. "},{"num":7,"verse":"He who doubts is thinking two different things at the same time. He cannot decide about anything he does. A person like that should not think that he will receive anything from the Lord."},{"header":"True Riches"},{"num":9,"verse":"If a believer is poor, he should take pride that God has made him spiritually rich.
