He will not rebuke you for asking."},{"num":6,"verse":"But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind."},{"num":7,"verse":"Such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord."},{"num":8,"verse":"Their loyalty is divided between God and the world, and they are unstable in everything they do."},{"num":9,"verse":"Believers who are poor have something to boast about, for God has honored them."},{"num":10,"verse":"And those who are rich should boast that God has humbled them. They will fade away like a little flower in the field."},{"num":11,"verse":"The hot sun rises and the grass withers; the little flower droops and falls, and its beauty fades away.
