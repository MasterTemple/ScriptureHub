"},{"num":4,"verse":"And let endurance be having its complete work in order that you may be complete and whole, lacking in nothing. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And if any of you is lacking wisdom, let him be asking from the God giving generously to all and not reproaching, and it will be given to him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But let him be asking in faith, not doubting at all. For the one doubting is like a surge of the sea being blown-by-wind and tossed. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For let that person not be supposing that he will receive anything from the Lord— "},{"num":8,"verse":"a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. "},{"num":9,"verse":"And let the lowly brother be boasting in his height, "},{"num":10,"verse":"and the rich one in his lowliness, because he will pass-away like a flower of grass.
