"},{"num":10,"verse":"For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all. "},{"num":11,"verse":"For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18 also said, “Do not commit murder.”Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17 Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So speak and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy.
