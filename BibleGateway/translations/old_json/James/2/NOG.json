"},{"num":2,"verse":"For example, two men come to your worship service. One man is wearing gold rings and fine clothes; the other man, who is poor, is wearing shabby clothes. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Suppose you give special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say to him, “Please have a seat.” But you say to the poor man, “Stand over there,” or “Sit on the floor at my feet.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Aren’t you discriminating against people and using a corrupt standard to make judgments?"},{"num":5,"verse":"Listen, my dear brothers and sisters! Didn’t God choose poor people in the world to become rich in faith and to receive the kingdom that he promised to those who love him? "},{"num":6,"verse":"Yet, you show no respect to poor people. Don’t rich people oppress you and drag you into court?

"},{"num":11,"verse":"After all, the one who said, “Never commit adultery,” is the same one who said, “Never murder.” If you do not commit adultery but you murder, you become a person who disobeys God’s laws."},{"num":12,"verse":"Talk and act as people who are going to be judged by laws that bring freedom.
