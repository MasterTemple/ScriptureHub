"},{"num":2,"verse":"This is the way you are to do it: Every man who has loaned money must forget the debt.

"},{"num":4,"verse":"Yet there will be no poor among you for the Lord will be sure to bring good to you in the land the Lord your God is giving you for your own. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But you must listen and obey the voice of the Lord your God. Be careful to do all the Law which I am telling you today. "},{"num":6,"verse":"The Lord your God will bring good to you as He has promised. You will let many nations use what belongs to you but you will not use what belongs to them.

"},{"num":9,"verse":"Be careful that there is no sinful thought in your heart, saying, ‘It is almost the seventh year, the time to do away with the debt owed to me,’ so you look on your brother with hate and give him nothing. Then he may cry to the Lord against you and you may be guilty of sin. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Give much to him, without being sorry that you do. Because the Lord your God will bring good to you for this, in all your work and in everything you do. "},{"num":11,"verse":"The poor will always be in the land.
