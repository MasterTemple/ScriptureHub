Open your hand wide to them. You must generously lend them whatever they need."},{"num":9,"verse":"But watch yourself! Make sure no wicked thought crosses your mind, such as, The seventh year is coming—the year of debt cancellation—so that you resent your poor fellow Israelites and don’t give them anything. If you do that, they will cry out to the Lord against you, and you will be guilty of sin."},{"num":10,"verse":"No, give generously to needy persons.
