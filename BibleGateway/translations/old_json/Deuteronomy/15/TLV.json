"},{"num":5,"verse":"If only you would carefully listen to the voice of Adonai your God, being careful to do all these mitzvah that I am commanding you today! "},{"num":6,"verse":"For Adonai your God will bless you as He promised you. So you will lend to many nations, but not borrow; you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you."},{"num":7,"verse":"“If there is a poor man among you—any of your brothers within any of your gates in your land that Adonai your God is giving you—you are not to harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother."},{"num":8,"verse":" Rather, you must surely open your hand to him and you must surely lend him enough for his need—whatever he is lacking. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Watch yourself, so there is no unworthy thing in your heart saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of cancelling debts, is near,’ and your eye is evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing. Then he may call out to Adonai against you, and it will be a sin upon you. "},{"num":10,"verse":"You must surely give to him, and your heart is not to be grieved when you give to him—for because of this thing Adonai your God will bless you in all your work and in every undertaking of your hand."},{"num":11,"verse":"“For there will never cease to be poor people in the land.
