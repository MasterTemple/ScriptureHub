"},{"num":2,"verse":"Do not add to the word that I am commanding you, and do not subtract from it, so that you keep the commandments of the Lord your God that I am commanding you. "},{"num":3,"verse":"With your own eyes you have been observing what the Lord did at Baal Peor. Indeed, the Lord your God destroyed from among you every man who followed the Baal of Peor."},{"num":4,"verse":"But all of you, who are clinging to the Lord your God, are still alive today. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Note well now, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, as the Lord my God commanded me, so that you may carry them out also in the land that you are entering to take as a possession. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Keep them and put them into practice, because in this way your wisdom and your understanding will be recognized by all the people who hear about all these statutes; and they will say, “This great nation is certainly a wise and understanding people,” "},{"num":7,"verse":"because what other great nation is there that has a god as close to it as the Lord our God is to us whenever we call on him?
