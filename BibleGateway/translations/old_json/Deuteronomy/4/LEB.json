"},{"num":3,"verse":"Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did with the case of Baal Peor, for each man that followed after Baal Peor Yahweh your God destroyed from your midst. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But you, the ones holding fast to Yahweh your God, are all alive today."},{"num":5,"verse":"See, I now teach you rules and regulations just as Yahweh my God has commanded me, to observe them just so in the midst of the land where you are going, to take possession of it.
