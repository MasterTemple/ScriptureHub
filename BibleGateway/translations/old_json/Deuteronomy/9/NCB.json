Hear, O Israel, today you are going to pass over the Jordan to dispossess nations more powerful than you are which have large cities whose walls reach up into the heavens."},{"num":2,"verse":"The people are strong and tall, descendants of the Anakim. You know all about them, for you have heard it said, “Who can stand up against the Anakim?”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Understand, therefore, that the Lord, your God, is crossing over ahead of you like a devouring fire today. He will destroy them and bring them low before you.

They have quickly turned aside from the path that I had directed them to follow and they have made a molten image for themselves.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Furthermore, the Lord also said to me, “I have observed this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people."},{"num":14,"verse":"Leave me alone, so I can destroy them and blot out their name from under the heavens.

You did not trust him nor listen to his voice."},{"num":24,"verse":"You have despised the Lord from the first day that I knew you."},{"num":25,"verse":"I fell down and lay prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights because the Lord said that he was going to destroy you."},{"num":26,"verse":"I prayed to the Lord and said, “O Lord, God, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance, whom you redeemed by your great power, and whom you brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand."},{"num":27,"verse":"Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not consider the stubbornness of this people nor the wickedness of their sin."},{"num":28,"verse":"Otherwise, the people of the land from which you brought them will say, ‘The Lord brought them out and put them to death in the desert because he was not able to bring them into the land that he had promised them and also because he hated them.’"},{"num":29,"verse":"Yet, they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out with your great power and your outstretched arm.”"}]
