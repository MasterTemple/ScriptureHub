[{"num":19,"verse":"“When Yahweh your God has exterminated the nations concerning whom Yahweh your God is giving to you their land, and you have dispossessed them, and you have settled in their towns and in their houses, "},{"num":2,"verse":"you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land that Yahweh your God is giving to you to take possession of it.
