You will live where these people lived. You will take their cities and their houses. When that happens,"},{"num":2,"verse":"you must divide the land that the Lord your God is giving you. Divide it into three parts and choose a city in the middle of each part that can be a place of safety. You must also build good roads to these cities. Then whoever kills another person may run to the closest city of safety."},{"num":4,"verse":"“This is the rule for someone who kills another person and runs to one of these three cities for safety: It must be someone who killed another person accidentally, not out of hatred."},{"num":5,"verse":"Here is an example: A man goes into the forest with another person to cut wood. The man swings his ax to cut down a tree, but the head of the ax separates from the handle. The ax head hits the other person and kills him. The man who swung the ax may then run to one of these three cities and be safe."},{"num":6,"verse":"But if the city is too far away, he might not be able to run there fast enough. A close relative of the person he killed might run after him and catch him before he reaches the city. The relative might kill the man in anger, even though he did not deserve to die because he did not mean to harm anyone."},{"num":7,"verse":"That is why I commanded you to choose three special cities."},{"num":8,"verse":"“The Lord your God promised your fathers that he would make your land larger.

If he kills that person and runs to one of these cities of safety,"},{"num":12,"verse":"the elders in his hometown must send someone to get him and take him away from the city of safety. These leaders must hand him over to the close relative. He is a murderer and he must die."},{"num":13,"verse":"Don’t feel sorry for him.

Then everything will go well for you."},{"header":"Property Lines"},{"num":14,"verse":"“You must not move the stones that mark your neighbor’s property.
