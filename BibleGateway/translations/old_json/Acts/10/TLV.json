"},{"num":11,"verse":"He saw the heavens opened, and something like a great sheet coming down, lowered by its four corners to the earth.

Kill and eat.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"But Peter said, “Certainly not, Lord! For never have I eaten anything unholy or unclean.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"Again a voice came to him, a second time: “What God has made clean, you must not consider unholy.” "},{"num":16,"verse":"This happened three times, and the sheet was immediately taken up to heaven."},{"num":17,"verse":"Now while Peter was puzzling about what the vision he had seen might mean, behold, the men sent by Cornelius found Simon’s house and appeared before the gate. "},{"num":18,"verse":"They called out and began to ask whether Simon, also called Peter, was staying in this place as a guest."},{"num":19,"verse":"Now while Peter was mulling over the vision, the Ruach said to him, “Look here, three men are looking for you. "},{"num":20,"verse":"But get up, go downstairs, and go with them without hesitating, because I Myself have sent them.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"Going down to the men, Peter said, “Here, I’m the one you’re looking for.
