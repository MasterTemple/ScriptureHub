[{"header":"Peter Teaches Cornelius"},{"num":10,"verse":"At Caesarea [a coastal city, 25 miles south of Mount Carmel; a center of Roman government for Palestine] there was a man named Cornelius, ·an officer [a centurion; an officer in charge of about a hundred soldiers] in the Italian ·group of the Roman army [cohort; regiment; a cohort was about six hundred soldiers]. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Cornelius was a ·religious [pious; godly] man. He and all ·the other people who lived in his house [his household] ·worshiped the true God [feared God; “God-fearers” were Gentiles who worshiped the one true God of Israel]. He gave much of his money to ·the poor [or the Jewish people; the people] and prayed to God often. "},{"num":3,"verse":"·One afternoon about three o’clock [About the ninth hour of the day], Cornelius clearly saw a vision. An angel of God came to him and said, “Cornelius!”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Cornelius stared at the angel. He ·became afraid [was terrified] and said, “What do you want, ·Lord [or sir]?”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Send some men now to Joppa [9:36] to bring back a man named Simon who is also called Peter. "},{"num":6,"verse":"He is staying [as a guest] with a man, ·also named Simon, who is a tanner [or named Simon Byrseus; 9:43] and has a house beside the sea.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"When the angel who spoke to Cornelius left, Cornelius called two of his ·servants [household slaves/servants] and a soldier, a ·religious [devout; pious; godly] man who ·worked for him [or was on his staff; or was loyal to him]. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Cornelius explained everything to them and sent them to Joppa."},{"num":9,"verse":"About ·noon [the sixth hour] the next day as they ·came near Joppa [journeyed and drew near the city], Peter was going up to the roof [in ancient Israel flat roofs were used as living spaces and for storage] to pray. "},{"num":10,"verse":"He was hungry and wanted to eat, but while the food was being prepared, he ·had a vision [or fell into a trance]. "},{"num":11,"verse":"He saw heaven opened and ·something [an object] coming down that looked like a big sheet being lowered to earth by its four corners. "},{"num":12,"verse":"In it were all kinds of ·animals [four-footed creatures], reptiles, and birds [of the air/sky]. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Then a voice said to Peter, “Get up, Peter; kill and eat.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"But Peter said, “·No [Absolutely not], Lord! I have never eaten food that is ·unholy [profane; common] or ·unclean [ritually defiled; the OT food laws differentiated Israelites from Gentiles; Lev. 11; Ezek. 4:13–15].”"},{"num":15,"verse":"But the voice said to him again, “God has made these things clean, so don’t call them ·‘unholy’ [‘profane’; ‘common’]!” "},{"num":16,"verse":"This happened three times, and at once the ·sheet [object; thing] was taken back to heaven."},{"num":17,"verse":"While Peter was ·wondering [perplexed about] what this vision meant, [look; behold] the men Cornelius sent had found Simon’s house and were standing at the gate. "},{"num":18,"verse":"They asked, “Is ·Simon Peter [Simon who is called Peter] staying [as a guest] here?”"},{"num":19,"verse":"While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “·Listen [Look; Behold], three men are looking for you. "},{"num":20,"verse":"[So; But] Get up and go downstairs. Go with them without ·doubting [or hesitation], because I have sent them to you.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"So Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are ·looking [searching] for. Why did you come here?”"},{"num":22,"verse":"They said, “A holy angel spoke to Cornelius, ·an army officer [a centurion] and a ·good [righteous] man; he ·worships [fears] God. ·All the people [The whole Jewish nation] ·respect [speak well of; testify to] him. The angel told Cornelius to ask you to come to his house so that he can hear what you have to say.” "},{"num":23,"verse":"So Peter ·asked [invited] the men to come in and ·spend the night [entertained them as guests; an unusual gesture, since Jews would not normally invite Gentiles into their homes]."},{"num":24,"verse":"On the following day they came to Caesarea [10:1]. Cornelius was ·waiting for [expecting] them and had called together his relatives and close friends. "},{"num":25,"verse":"When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him. "},{"num":26,"verse":"But Peter helped him up, saying, “Stand up. I too am only a ·human [mortal].” "},{"num":27,"verse":"As he talked with Cornelius, Peter went inside where he ·saw [found] many people gathered. "},{"num":28,"verse":"He said, “You people understand that it is against our law for Jewish people to associate with or visit anyone who is a ·foreigner [Gentile]. But God has shown me that I should not call any person unholy [profane; common] or unclean [defiled]. "},{"num":29,"verse":"That is why I did not ·argue [object] when I was asked to come here. Now, please tell me why you sent for me.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Cornelius said, “Four days ago [10:3], I was praying in my house at this same time—·three o’clock in the afternoon [at the ninth hour]. Suddenly, there was a man standing before me wearing ·shining [dazzling] clothes. "},{"num":31,"verse":"He said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and ·has seen that you give to the poor and remembers you [your alms have been remembered by/before God]. "},{"num":32,"verse":"So send some men to Joppa and ask Simon [who is called] Peter to come. Peter is staying [as a guest] in the house of a man, ·also named Simon, who is a tanner [or named Simon Byrseus; 9:43] and has a house beside the sea [see 10:5–6].’ "},{"num":33,"verse":"So I sent for you immediately, and it was ·very good [kind] of you to come. Now we are all here ·before [in the presence of; or available to] God to hear everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"Peter ·began to speak [opened his mouth]: “I ·really [truly] understand now that ·to God every person is the same [God does not show favoritism/partiality]. "},{"num":35,"verse":"[But] In every ·country [nation] God accepts anyone who ·worships [fears] him and ·does what is right [practices righteousness]. "},{"num":36,"verse":"You know the ·message [word] that God has sent to the people of Israel ·is the Good News that peace [announcing/proclaiming the Gospel of peace that] has come through Jesus Christ. Jesus is the Lord of all people [both Jews and Gentiles]! "},{"num":37,"verse":"You know what has happened all over Judea, beginning in Galilee after John [the Baptist] preached to the people about baptism [Luke 3]. "},{"num":38,"verse":"You know about Jesus from Nazareth, that God ·gave him [anointed him with] the Holy Spirit and power. You know how Jesus went everywhere doing good and healing those who were ·ruled [oppressed] by the devil, because God was with him. "},{"num":39,"verse":"We ·saw [witnessed] what Jesus did in [the region/country of] Judea and in Jerusalem, but ·the Jews in Jerusalem [they] killed him by hanging him on a ·cross [tree]. "},{"num":40,"verse":"Yet, on the third day, God raised Jesus ·to life [or from the dead] and caused him to be seen, "},{"num":41,"verse":"not by all the people, but only by the witnesses God had already chosen. And we are those witnesses who ate and drank with him after he was raised from the dead. "},{"num":42,"verse":"He ·told [commanded] us to preach to the people and to ·tell them [testify; bear witness] that he is the one whom God ·chose [appointed; determined] to be the judge of the living and the dead. "},{"num":43,"verse":"All the prophets ·say it is true [witnessed; testified] that all who believe in Jesus will be forgiven of their sins through Jesus’ name.”"},{"num":44,"verse":"While Peter was still saying ·this [these words], the Holy Spirit ·came down [fell] on all those who ·were listening [heard the word/message]. "},{"num":45,"verse":"The ·Jewish [circumcised] believers who came with Peter were ·amazed [astonished] that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been ·given [poured out] even to the ·nations [Gentiles]. "},{"num":46,"verse":"[For] ·These believers [They] heard them speaking in different languages [tongues; either other languages or ecstatic utterance] and ·praising [magnifying] God. Then Peter said, "},{"num":47,"verse":"“Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we did!” "},{"num":48,"verse":"So Peter ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days."}]
