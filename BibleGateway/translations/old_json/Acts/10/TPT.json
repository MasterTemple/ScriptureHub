[{"header":"An Angel Comes to Cornelius"},{"num":10,"verse":"At that time there was a Roman military officer, Cornelius, who was in charge of one hundred men stationed in Caesarea. He was the captain of the Italian regiment, "},{"num":2,"verse":"a devout man of extraordinary character who worshiped God and prayed regularly, together with all his family.

He asked, “What do you want, Lord?”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Now, send some men to Joppa at once. Have them find a man named Simon the Rock, "},{"num":6,"verse":"who is staying as a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"After the angel left, Cornelius called for two of his servants and a trusted, godly soldier who was his personal attaché.

"},{"num":10,"verse":"He was hungry and wanted to eat, but while lunch was being prepared he fell into a trance and entered into another realm. "},{"num":11,"verse":"As the heavenly realm opened up, he saw something resembling a large linen tablecloth that descended from above, being let down to the earth by its four corners. "},{"num":12,"verse":"As it floated down he saw that it held many kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and wild birds."},{"num":13,"verse":"A voice said to him, “Peter, go and prepare them to be eaten.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Peter replied, “There’s no way I could do that, Lord, for I’ve never eaten anything forbidden or impure according to our Jewish laws.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"The voice spoke again. “Nothing is unclean if God declares it to be clean.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"The vision was repeated three times. Then suddenly the linen sheet was snatched back up into heaven."},{"num":17,"verse":"Peter was so stunned by the vision that he couldn’t stop wondering about what all it meant."},{"num":18,"verse":"They called out to those in the house, “Is this where Simon, the Rock, is staying?”"},{"num":19,"verse":"As Peter was in deep thought, trying to interpret the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Go downstairs now, for three men are looking for you. Don’t hesitate to go with them, because I have sent them.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"Peter went downstairs to the men and said, “I believe I’m the one you’re looking for. What brings you here?”"},{"num":22,"verse":"They answered, “We serve Cornelius, a Roman military captain, who sent us to find you. He is a devout man of the highest integrity who worships God and is respected throughout the Jewish community. He was divinely instructed through the appearance of an angel to summon you to his home and to listen to the message that you would bring him.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"Peter invited them to stay for the night as his guests.

Yet God has shown me that I should never view anyone as inferior or ritually unclean. "},{"num":29,"verse":"So when you sent for me, I came without objection. Now, may I ask why you sent for me?”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Cornelius replied, “Four days ago I was fasting and praying here in my home at this very hour, three o’clock in the afternoon, when a man in glistening clothing suddenly appeared in front of my eyes. "},{"num":31,"verse":"He said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayers. Your generosity to the poor has been recorded and remembered in God’s presence. "},{"num":32,"verse":"However, you must send for a man named Simon, the Rock, who is staying in Joppa as a guest of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’ "},{"num":33,"verse":"So I immediately sent my men to bring you here—and you were kind enough to come. And now, here we are, all of us in God’s presence, anxious to hear the message that God has put into your heart to share with us.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"Peter said, “Now I know for certain that God doesn’t show favoritism with people but treats everyone on the same basis. "},{"num":35,"verse":"It makes no difference what race of people one belongs to. If they show deep reverence for God, and are committed to doing what’s right, they are acceptable before him. "},{"num":36,"verse":"God sent his word to the Jewish people first, announcing the wonderful news of hope and peace through Jesus, the Anointed One, the Lord of all.
