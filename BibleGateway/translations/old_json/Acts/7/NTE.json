Then, from there, after his father’s death, God moved him on to this land in which you now live. "},{"num":5,"verse":"God didn’t give him an inheritance here, not even a place to stand up in. Instead, he promised (when Abraham still had no child) that he would give it as a possession to his seed after him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"This is what God said to him: that his seed would be strangers in a foreign land, that they would serve there as slaves, and that they would be afflicted for four hundred years. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But God said that he would judge the nation that had enslaved them, and that they would then come out and worship him “on this mountain”. "},{"num":8,"verse":"And he gave them the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and he circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs."},{"num":9,"verse":"‘Now the patriarchs became angry with Joseph, and were jealous of him. They sold him into Egypt. But God was with him, "},{"num":10,"verse":"and rescued him from all his troubles and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, making him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. "},{"num":11,"verse":"But then there was a famine over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, which resulted in great hardship. Our ancestors couldn’t find food to eat. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Jacob, however, heard that there was grain in Egypt, and sent our ancestors there on an initial visit. "},{"num":13,"verse":"On their second trip, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and revealed to Pharaoh what family he was from. "},{"num":14,"verse":"So Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all the family, seventy-five people in all. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Jacob came to Egypt, and he and our ancestors died there. "},{"num":16,"verse":"They were brought back to Shechem, and buried in the tomb which Abraham had bought with silver, at a named price, from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.’"},{"header":"Stephen and Moses"},{"num":17,"verse":"‘God had sworn an oath to Abraham,’ Stephen continued. ‘When the time drew near for this promise to be fulfilled, the people had increased and multiplied in Egypt, "},{"num":18,"verse":"until another king arose over Egypt, one who had not known Joseph. "},{"num":19,"verse":"He got the better of our people, and ill-treated our ancestors, forcing them to abandon their newborn children so that they would die."},{"num":20,"verse":"‘It was at that time that Moses was born, and he was a noble-looking child. He was nursed for three months in his father’s house. "},{"num":21,"verse":"But, when they abandoned him, Pharaoh’s daughter claimed him and brought him up as her own son. "},{"num":22,"verse":"So Moses was educated in the full teaching of Egyptian wisdom, and he was powerful in what he said and did."},{"num":23,"verse":"‘When he had grown to about forty years old, it came into his heart to see how his family, the children of Israel, were doing. "},{"num":24,"verse":"He saw someone being wronged, and came to the man’s defence; he took revenge on behalf of the man who was being oppressed, by striking down the Egyptian.

Why are you wronging each other?” "},{"num":27,"verse":"But the man who was wronging the other wasn’t having it. “Who d’you think you are?” he retorted, pushing him away. “Who made you a ruler or judge over us? "},{"num":28,"verse":"Do you want to kill me in the same way you killed the Egyptian yesterday?” "},{"num":29,"verse":"At that word, Moses ran away, and lived as a guest in the land of Midian, where he had two sons."},{"num":30,"verse":"‘After another forty years, an angel appeared to him in the desert at Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush.

But, as he came closer to see, there came the voice of the Lord: "},{"num":32,"verse":"“I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.” Moses was very frightened, and didn’t dare to look. "},{"num":33,"verse":"But the Lord said to him, “Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.

So, come on now: I’m going to send you to Egypt.” ’"},{"header":"Handmade Shrines"},{"num":35,"verse":"‘So’, Stephen continued, ‘this same Moses – the one they rejected, saying “Who made you a ruler or judge?” – this is the man God sent as ruler and redeemer, by the hand of the angel who had appeared to him in the bush.

I will remove you beyond Babylon!”"},{"num":44,"verse":"‘Our ancestors had the “tent of meeting” in the desert. God had commanded Moses to make it according to the pattern which he had seen.
