After his father died, God had him move from there to this country in which you are now living. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He did not give him any of it as a heritage, not even a foot’s length, but promised to give it to him as his possession and to his descendants after him, even though he had no child. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And God spoke in these terms, that his descendants would be resident aliens in a country belonging to others, who would enslave them and mistreat them during four hundred years. "},{"num":7,"verse":"‘But I will judge the nation that they serve,’ said God, ‘and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs."},{"num":9,"verse":"“The patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him, "},{"num":10,"verse":"and rescued him from all his afflictions, and enabled him to win favor and to show wisdom when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Now there came a famine throughout Egypt and Canaan, and great suffering, and our ancestors could find no food. "},{"num":12,"verse":"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there on their first visit. "},{"num":13,"verse":"On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five in all; "},{"num":15,"verse":"so Jacob went down to Egypt.

Come now, I will send you to Egypt.’"},{"num":35,"verse":"“It was this Moses whom they rejected when they said, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ and whom God now sent as both ruler and liberator through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. "},{"num":36,"verse":"He led them out, having performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years. "},{"num":37,"verse":"This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘God will raise up a prophet for you from your own people as he raised me up.’ "},{"num":38,"verse":"He is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living oracles to give to us. "},{"num":39,"verse":"Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him; instead, they pushed him aside, and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt, "},{"num":40,"verse":"saying to Aaron, ‘Make gods for us who will lead the way for us; as for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’ "},{"num":41,"verse":"At that time they made a calf, offered a sacrifice to the idol, and reveled in the works of their hands. "},{"num":42,"verse":"But God turned away from them and handed them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets:"},{"num":44,"verse":"“Our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness, as God directed when he spoke to Moses, ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen. "},{"num":45,"verse":"Our ancestors in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors. And it was there until the time of David, "},{"num":46,"verse":"who found favor with God and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob. "},{"num":47,"verse":"But it was Solomon who built a house for him. "},{"num":48,"verse":"Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with human hands; as the prophet says,"},{"num":51,"verse":"“You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you are forever opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do.
