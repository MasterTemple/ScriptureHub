Then after the death of his father, God had him move to this country where you now live. "},{"num":5,"verse":"God gave him no property here, not even a foot of land, yet he promised to give it to him and to his descendants after him as a permanent possession, even though he had no child."},{"num":6,"verse":"“This is what God promised: His descendants would be strangers in a foreign country, and its people would enslave them and oppress them for 400 years. "},{"num":7,"verse":"‘But I will punish the nation they serve,’ said God, ‘and afterwards they will leave and worship me in this place.’"},{"num":8,"verse":"Later, God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. Later, he fathered Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Then Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered the twelve patriarchs."},{"num":9,"verse":"“Joseph’s brothers became jealous of him and sold Joseph as a slave in Egypt. However, God was with him "},{"num":10,"verse":"and rescued him from all his troubles.

Then he and our ancestors died. "},{"num":16,"verse":"They were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought at a high price from Hamor’s descendants in Shechem."},{"num":17,"verse":"“Now as the time approached for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people’s population increased a great deal in Egypt.

Now come, I’ll send you to Egypt.’"},{"num":35,"verse":"“This same Moses—whom they rejected by saying, ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’—was the man whom God sent to be both their ruler and deliverer with the help of the angel who had appeared to him in the bush. "},{"num":36,"verse":"It was he who led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for 40 years. "},{"num":37,"verse":"It was this Moses who told the Israelis, ‘God will raise up a prophet for you from among your own brothers, just as he did me.’ "},{"num":38,"verse":"This Moses is the one who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and to our ancestors. He received living truths to give to us, "},{"num":39,"verse":"but our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and wished to return to Egypt.

This Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt—we don’t know what happened to him!’"},{"num":41,"verse":"“At that time they even made a calf to be their idol, offered a sacrifice to it, and delighted in what they had made with their hands. "},{"num":42,"verse":"So God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the heavenly bodies. As it is written in the book of the Prophets:"},{"num":44,"verse":"“Our ancestors had the Tent of Testimony in the wilderness constructed, just as the one who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern he had seen. "},{"num":45,"verse":"Our ancestors brought it here with Joshua when they replaced the nations that God drove out in front of our ancestors, and it was here until the time of David. "},{"num":46,"verse":"He found favor with God and asked to design a dwelling for the house of Jacob, "},{"num":47,"verse":"but it was Solomon who built a house for him. "},{"num":48,"verse":"However, the Most High does not live in buildings made by human hands. As the prophet says,"},{"num":51,"verse":"“You stubborn people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are always opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do. "},{"num":52,"verse":"Which of the prophets did your ancestors fail to persecute? They killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers.
