"},{"num":2,"verse":"There the ·leading [chief] priests and the important leaders [of the Jews] made charges against Paul before Festus.

The ·people [Jews] who had come [down] from Jerusalem stood around him, making serious charges against him, which they could not prove. "},{"num":8,"verse":"This is what Paul said to defend himself: “I have done ·nothing wrong [committed no offense/sin/crime] against the law [of the Jews], against the Temple, or against Caesar.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"But Festus wanted to ·please [curry favor with; or do a favor for] the ·people [Jews].

But if these charges are ·not true [baseless], then no one can ·give me [hand me over; or make me a gift; Paul detects Festus’ desire to gain favor with the Jews] to them. I ·want Caesar to hear my case [appeal to Caesar/the emperor; the right of a Roman citizen for a capital offense]!”"},{"num":12,"verse":"Festus talked about this with his ·advisers [council].
