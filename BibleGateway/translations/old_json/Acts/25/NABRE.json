Three days after his arrival in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem "},{"num":2,"verse":"where the chief priests and Jewish leaders presented him their formal charges against Paul. They asked him "},{"num":3,"verse":"as a favor to have him sent to Jerusalem, for they were plotting to kill him along the way. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Festus replied that Paul was being held in custody in Caesarea and that he himself would be returning there shortly. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He said, “Let your authorities come down with me, and if this man has done something improper, let them accuse him.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"After spending no more than eight or ten days with them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the following day took his seat on the tribunal and ordered that Paul be brought in. "},{"num":7,"verse":"When he appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him and brought many serious charges against him, which they were unable to prove. "},{"num":8,"verse":"In defending himself Paul said, “I have committed no crime either against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Festus, wishing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, said to Paul in reply, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there stand trial before me on these charges?” "},{"num":10,"verse":"Paul answered, “I am standing before the tribunal of Caesar; this is where I should be tried.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"Since they spent several days there, Festus referred Paul’s case to the king, saying, “There is a man here left in custody by Felix. "},{"num":15,"verse":"When I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him and demanded his condemnation. "},{"num":16,"verse":"I answered them that it was not Roman practice to hand over an accused person before he has faced his accusers and had the opportunity to defend himself against their charge. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So when [they] came together here, I made no delay; the next day I took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in. "},{"num":18,"verse":"His accusers stood around him, but did not charge him with any of the crimes I suspected. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Instead they had some issues with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who had died but who Paul claimed was alive.
