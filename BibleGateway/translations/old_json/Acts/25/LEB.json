"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and he himself was about to go there in a short time. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So he said, “Let those among you who are prominent go down with me, and if there is any wrong in the man, let them bring charges against him.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"And after he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. On the next day he sat down on the judgment seat and gave orders for Paul to be brought. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges that they were not able to prove, "},{"num":8,"verse":"while Paul said in his defense, “Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned with reference to anything!” "},{"num":9,"verse":"But Festus, because he wanted to do a favor for the Jews, answered and said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried before me there concerning these things?” "},{"num":10,"verse":"But Paul said, “I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where it is necessary for me to be judged.

But if there is nothing true of the things which these people are accusing me, no one can give me up to them.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"And while they were staying there many days, Festus laid out the case against Paul to the king, saying, “There is a certain man left behind by Felix as a prisoner, "},{"num":15,"verse":"concerning whom when I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews presented evidence, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. "},{"num":16,"verse":"To them I replied that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up any man before the one who had been accused met his accusers face to face and received an opportunity for a defense concerning the accusation. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Therefore, when they had assembled here, I made no delay; on the next day I sat down on the judgment seat and gave orders for the man to be brought. "},{"num":18,"verse":"When they stood up, his accusers began bringing no charge concerning him of the evil deeds that I was suspecting, "},{"num":19,"verse":"but they had some issues with him concerning their own religion, and concerning a certain Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul claimed to be alive. "},{"num":20,"verse":"And because I was at a loss with regard to the investigation concerning these things, I asked if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and to be judged there concerning these things.
