The church would gather as a unified group in Solomon’s Porch, "},{"num":13,"verse":"enjoying great respect by the people of the city—though most people wouldn’t risk publicly affiliating with them. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Even so, record numbers of believers—both men and women—were added to the Lord.
