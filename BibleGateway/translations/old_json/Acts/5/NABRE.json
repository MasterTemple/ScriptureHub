"},{"num":2,"verse":"He retained for himself, with his wife’s knowledge, some of the purchase price, took the remainder, and put it at the feet of the apostles. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart so that you lied to the holy Spirit and retained part of the price of the land? "},{"num":4,"verse":"While it remained unsold, did it not remain yours? And when it was sold, was it not still under your control? Why did you contrive this deed? You have lied not to human beings, but to God.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last, and great fear came upon all who heard of it. "},{"num":6,"verse":"The young men came and wrapped him up, then carried him out and buried him."},{"num":7,"verse":"After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, unaware of what had happened. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Peter said to her, “Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?” She answered, “Yes, for that amount.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Peter said to her, “Why did you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen, the footsteps of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.” "},{"num":10,"verse":"At once, she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men entered they found her dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"A large number of people from the towns in the vicinity of Jerusalem also gathered, bringing the sick and those disturbed by unclean spirits, and they were all cured."},{"num":17,"verse":"Then the high priest rose up and all his companions, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and, filled with jealousy, "},{"num":18,"verse":"laid hands upon the apostles and put them in the public jail. "},{"num":19,"verse":"But during the night, the angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, led them out, and said, "},{"num":20,"verse":"“Go and take your place in the temple area, and tell the people everything about this life.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"When they heard this, they went to the temple early in the morning and taught. When the high priest and his companions arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin, the full senate of the Israelites, and sent to the jail to have them brought in.

Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and want to bring this man’s blood upon us.” "},{"num":29,"verse":"But Peter and the apostles said in reply, “We must obey God rather than men. "},{"num":30,"verse":"The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, though you had him killed by hanging him on a tree. "},{"num":31,"verse":"God exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior to grant Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.
