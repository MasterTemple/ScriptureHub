"},{"num":2,"verse":"But with his wife's agreement he kept part of the money for himself and turned the rest over to the apostles. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Peter said to him, “Ananias, why did you let Satan take control of you and make you lie to the Holy Spirit by keeping part of the money you received for the property? "},{"num":4,"verse":"Before you sold the property, it belonged to you; and after you sold it, the money was yours. Why, then, did you decide to do such a thing? You have not lied to people—you have lied to God!” "},{"num":5,"verse":"As soon as Ananias heard this, he fell down dead; and all who heard about it were terrified. "},{"num":6,"verse":"The young men came in, wrapped up his body, carried him out, and buried him."},{"num":7,"verse":"About three hours later his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Peter asked her, “Tell me, was this the full amount you and your husband received for your property?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So Peter said to her, “Why did you and your husband decide to put the Lord's Spirit to the test? The men who buried your husband are at the door right now, and they will carry you out too!” "},{"num":10,"verse":"At once she fell down at his feet and died.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"But more and more people were added to the group—a crowd of men and women who believed in the Lord. "},{"num":15,"verse":"As a result of what the apostles were doing, sick people were carried out into the streets and placed on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. "},{"num":16,"verse":"And crowds of people came in from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing those who were sick or who had evil spirits in them; and they were all healed."},{"header":"The Apostles Are Persecuted"},{"num":17,"verse":"Then the High Priest and all his companions, members of the local party of the Sadducees, became extremely jealous of the apostles; so they decided to take action.

"},{"num":28,"verse":"“We gave you strict orders not to teach in the name of this man,” he said; “but see what you have done! You have spread your teaching all over Jerusalem, and you want to make us responsible for his death!”"},{"num":29,"verse":"Peter and the other apostles answered, “We must obey God, not men. "},{"num":30,"verse":"The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from death, after you had killed him by nailing him to a cross.

He ordered the apostles to be taken out for a while, "},{"num":35,"verse":"and then he said to the Council, “Fellow Israelites, be careful what you do to these men.
