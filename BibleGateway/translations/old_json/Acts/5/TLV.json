"},{"num":4,"verse":"While it remained unsold, it was your own, wasn’t it? And after it was sold, wasn’t it at your disposal? How did this deed get into your heart? You haven’t lied to men but to God.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"As soon as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and died. Great fear came upon all who heard about it. "},{"num":6,"verse":"The young men got up and wrapped him in a shroud, then carried him out and buried him."},{"num":7,"verse":"After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Peter responded to her, “Tell me if you sold the land for this much.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Peter said to her, “How did you agree to test the Ruach Adonai? Look, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door—they will carry you out, too!”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Immediately she fell down at his feet and died.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"Yet more than ever those trusting in the Lord were added—large numbers of men and women. "},{"num":15,"verse":"They even carried the sick into the streets and laid them on stretchers and cots, so that when Peter passed by at least his shadow might fall on some of them.
