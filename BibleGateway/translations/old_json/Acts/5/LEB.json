"},{"num":3,"verse":"But Peter said, “Ananias, for what reason has Satan filled your heart, that you lied to the Holy Spirit and kept back for yourself some of the proceeds of the piece of land? "},{"num":4,"verse":"When it remained to you, did it not remain yours? And when it was sold, was it at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to people, but to God!”"},{"num":5,"verse":"And when Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came on all those who heard about it.

"},{"num":8,"verse":"And Peter said to her, “Tell me whether you both were paid this much for the piece of land.” And she said, “Yes, this much.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"So Peter said to her, “How is it that it was agreed by you two to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!” "},{"num":10,"verse":"And immediately she fell down at his feet and died.
