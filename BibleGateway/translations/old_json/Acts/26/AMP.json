[{"header":"Paul’s Defense before Agrippa"},{"num":26,"verse":"Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You are [now] permitted to speak on your own behalf.” At that, Paul stretched out his hand [as an orator] and made his defense [as follows]:"},{"num":2,"verse":"“I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, since it is before you that I am to make my defense today regarding all the charges brought against me by the Jews, "},{"num":3,"verse":"especially because you are an expert [fully knowledgeable, experienced and unusually conversant] in all the Jewish customs and controversial issues; therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently."},{"num":4,"verse":"“So then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation [the Jewish people], and in Jerusalem. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They have known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify to it, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I have lived as a Pharisee. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Which hope [of the Messiah and the resurrection] our twelve tribes [confidently] expect to realize as they serve and worship God in earnest night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews! "},{"num":8,"verse":"Why is it thought incredible by [any of] you that God raises the dead?"},{"num":9,"verse":"“So then, I [once] thought to myself that it was my duty to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. "},{"num":10,"verse":"And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; I not only locked up many of the saints (God’s people) in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being condemned to death, I cast my vote against them. "},{"num":11,"verse":"And I often punished them [making them suffer] in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme; and in my extreme rage at them, I kept hunting them even to foreign cities [harassing and persecuting them]."},{"num":12,"verse":"“While so engaged, as I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission and full power of the chief priests, "},{"num":13,"verse":"at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven surpassing the brightness of the sun, shining all around me and those who were traveling with me. "},{"num":14,"verse":"And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice in the Hebrew dialect (Jewish Aramaic) saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick [repeatedly] against the goads [offering pointless resistance].’ "},{"num":15,"verse":"And I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. "},{"num":17,"verse":"[choosing you for Myself and] rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you, "},{"num":19,"verse":"“So, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, "},{"num":20,"verse":"but I openly proclaimed first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout the region of Judea, and even to the Gentiles, that they should repent [change their inner self—their old way of thinking] and turn to God, doing deeds and living lives which are consistent with repentance. "},{"num":21,"verse":"Because of this some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But I have had help from God to this day, and I stand [before people] testifying to small and great alike, stating nothing except what the Prophets and Moses said would come to pass— "},{"num":23,"verse":"that the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) was to suffer, and that He by being the first to rise from the dead [with an incorruptible body] would proclaim light (salvation) both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"While Paul was making this defense, Festus said loudly, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great education is turning you toward madness.” "},{"num":25,"verse":"But Paul replied, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent and noble Festus, but [with a sound mind] I am uttering rational words of truth and reason. "},{"num":26,"verse":"For [your majesty] the king understands these things, and [therefore] I am also speaking to him with confidence and boldness, since I am convinced that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner [hidden from view, in secret]. "},{"num":27,"verse":"King Agrippa, do you believe the [writings of the] Prophets [their messages and words]? I know that you do.” "},{"num":28,"verse":"Then Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time [and with so little effort] you [almost] persuade me to become a Christian.” "},{"num":29,"verse":"And Paul replied, “Whether in a short time or long, I wish to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become such as I am, except for these chains.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Then the king stood up, and [with him] the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them; "},{"num":31,"verse":"and after they had gone out, they began saying to one another, “This man is not doing anything worthy of death or [even] of imprisonment.” "},{"num":32,"verse":"And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar (Emperor Nero).”"}]
