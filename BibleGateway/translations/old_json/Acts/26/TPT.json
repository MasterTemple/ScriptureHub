"},{"num":3,"verse":"Because you, more than anyone else, are very familiar with the customs and controversies among the Jewish people, I now ask for your patience as I state my case."},{"num":4,"verse":"“All the Jews know how I have been raised as a young man, living among my own people from the beginning and in Jerusalem. "},{"num":5,"verse":"If my accusers are willing to testify, they must admit that they’ve known me all along as a Pharisee, a member of the most strict and orthodox sect within Judaism. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And now, here I am on trial because I believe in the hope of God’s promises made to our ancestors. "},{"num":7,"verse":"This is the promise the twelve tribes of our people hope to see fulfilled as they sincerely strive to serve God with prayers night and day."},{"num":8,"verse":"And how should you judge this matter? Why is it that any of you think it unbelievable that God raises the dead? "},{"num":9,"verse":"I used to think that I should do all that was in my power to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

And then I went to Jerusalem and throughout our nation, and even to other nations, telling people everywhere that they must repent and turn to God and demonstrate it with a changed life. "},{"num":21,"verse":"That’s why the Jews seized me when I was in the temple and tried to murder me."},{"num":22,"verse":"“But in spite of all this, I have experienced the supernatural help of God up to this very moment.
