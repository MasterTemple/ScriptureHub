"},{"num":3,"verse":"He explained and proved that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am telling you about is the Messiah!” he said. "},{"num":4,"verse":"His words won over some of the Jews. They joined Paul and Silas. A large number of Greeks who worshiped God joined them too. So did quite a few important women."},{"num":5,"verse":"But other Jews were jealous. So they rounded up some evil people from the market place. Forming a crowd, they started all kinds of trouble in the city. The Jews rushed to Jason’s house. They were looking for Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them out to the crowd.

So they dragged Jason and some other believers to the city officials. “These men have caused trouble all over the world,” they shouted. “Now they have come here.

A number of important Greek women also became believers. And so did many Greek men."},{"num":13,"verse":"But the Jews in Thessalonica found out that Paul was preaching God’s word in Berea.

He was very upset to see that the city was full of statues of gods. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So he went to the synagogue. There he talked both with Jews and with Greeks who worshiped God. Each day he spoke with anyone who happened to be in the market place. "},{"num":18,"verse":"A group of Epicurean and Stoic thinkers began to argue with him. Some of them asked, “What is this fellow chattering about?” Others said, “He seems to be telling us about gods we’ve never heard of.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus. He was telling them that Jesus had risen from the dead. "},{"num":19,"verse":"They took him to a meeting of the Areopagus. There they said to him, “What is this new teaching you’re giving us?

"},{"num":26,"verse":"From one man he made all the people of the world. Now they live all over the earth. He decided exactly when they should live. And he decided exactly where they should live.

God has proved this to everyone by raising that man from the dead.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"They heard Paul talk about the dead being raised. Some of them made fun of this idea.
