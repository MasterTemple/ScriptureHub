[{"num":17,"verse":"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: "},{"num":2,"verse":"and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures, "},{"num":3,"verse":"opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, said he, I proclaim unto you, is the Christ. "},{"num":4,"verse":"And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
