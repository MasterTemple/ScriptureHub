Can we learn what you are talking about?"},{"num":20,"verse":"You’ve told us some strange things and we want to know what they mean.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"(They said this because all Athenians as well as the foreigners who live in Athens used to spend their time doing nothing but talking about or listening to the newest thing.)"},{"num":22,"verse":"Paul stood up in the middle of the council on Mars Hill and said, “People of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way."},{"num":23,"verse":"As I was walking through town and carefully observing your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: ‘To an unknown God.’ What you worship as unknown, I now proclaim to you."},{"num":24,"verse":"God, who made the world and everything in it, is Lord of heaven and earth.
