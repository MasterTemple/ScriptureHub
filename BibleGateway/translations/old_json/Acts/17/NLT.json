They attacked the home of Jason, searching for Paul and Silas so they could drag them out to the crowd."},{"num":6,"verse":"Not finding them there, they dragged out Jason and some of the other believers instead and took them before the city council. “Paul and Silas have caused trouble all over the world,” they shouted, “and now they are here disturbing our city, too."},{"num":7,"verse":"And Jason has welcomed them into his home. They are all guilty of treason against Caesar, for they profess allegiance to another king, named Jesus.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"The people of the city, as well as the city council, were thrown into turmoil by these reports."},{"num":9,"verse":"So the officials forced Jason and the other believers to post bond, and then they released them."},{"header":"Paul and Silas in Berea"},{"num":10,"verse":"That very night the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea.
