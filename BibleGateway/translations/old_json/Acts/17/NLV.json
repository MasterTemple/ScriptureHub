They took along some sinful men from the center of town where people gather and brought them out on the street. These angry men started all the people in the city to cry out with loud voices. They went to the house of Jason hoping to find Paul and Silas there and bring them out to the people. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But they did not find them there. Then they dragged Jason and some other Christians out in front of the leaders and cried out, “These men who have been making trouble over all the world have come here also.

Some of them said, “This man has lots of little things to talk about. They are not important. What is he trying to say?” Others said, “He preaches about strange gods.” It was because he preached of Jesus and of His being raised from the dead."},{"num":19,"verse":"Then they took him to Mars’ Hill and said, “We want to hear of this new teaching of yours.

Then they might feel after Him and find Him because He is not far from each one of us. "},{"num":28,"verse":"It is in Him that we live and move and keep on living. Some of your own men have written, ‘We are God’s children.’ "},{"num":29,"verse":"If we are God’s children, we should not think of Him as being like gold or silver or stone.
