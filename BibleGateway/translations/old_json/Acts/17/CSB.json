Attacking Jason’s house, they searched for them to bring them out to the public assembly. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city officials, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have come here too, "},{"num":7,"verse":"and Jason has welcomed them.

Upon arrival, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. "},{"num":11,"verse":"The people here were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, since they received the word with eagerness and examined the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Consequently, many of them believed, including a number of the prominent Greek women as well as men. "},{"num":13,"verse":"But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul at Berea, they came there too, agitating and upsetting the crowds. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Then the brothers and sisters immediately sent Paul away to go to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed on there.
