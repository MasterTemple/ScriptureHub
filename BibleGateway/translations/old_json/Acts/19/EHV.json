"},{"num":9,"verse":"But when some became hardened and refused to believe, even slandering the Way in front of the crowd, he left them. He took the disciples with him and led discussions every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.

They were all overcome with fear, and they held the name of the Lord Jesus in high honor. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Also many of those who had become believers came forward, confessing and admitting their actions. "},{"num":19,"verse":"And a large number of those who had practiced magic arts collected their books and burned them in front of everyone.
