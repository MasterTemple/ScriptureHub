"},{"num":9,"verse":"But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. "},{"num":10,"verse":"And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. "},{"num":11,"verse":"And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: "},{"num":12,"verse":"insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.
