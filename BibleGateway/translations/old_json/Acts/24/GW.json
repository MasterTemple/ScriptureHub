"},{"num":3,"verse":"We appreciate what you’ve done in every way and in every place, and we want to thank you very much. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I don’t want to keep you too long. Please listen to us. We will be brief. "},{"num":5,"verse":"We have found this man to be a troublemaker. He starts quarrels among all Jews throughout the world. He’s a ringleader of the Nazarene sect.
