"},{"num":3,"verse":"After we sighted Cyprus and left it behind on our port side, we sailed on to Syria and put in at Tyre, because the ship was to unload its cargo there. "},{"num":4,"verse":"After we located the disciples, we stayed there seven days. They repeatedly told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem. "},{"num":5,"verse":"When our time was over, we left and went on our way. All of them, with their wives and children, accompanied us outside of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, "},{"num":6,"verse":"we said farewell to one another. Then we went aboard the ship, and they returned to their own homes. "},{"num":7,"verse":"We continued the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais, and when we had greeted the brothers, we stayed with them for one day.
