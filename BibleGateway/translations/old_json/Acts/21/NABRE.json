"},{"num":3,"verse":"We caught sight of Cyprus but passed by it on our left and sailed on toward Syria and put in at Tyre where the ship was to unload cargo. "},{"num":4,"verse":"There we sought out the disciples and stayed for a week. They kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to embark for Jerusalem. "},{"num":5,"verse":"At the end of our stay we left and resumed our journey. All of them, women and children included, escorted us out of the city, and after kneeling on the beach to pray, "},{"num":6,"verse":"we bade farewell to one another. Then we boarded the ship, and they returned home."},{"num":7,"verse":"Arrival at Ptolemais and Caesarea. We continued the voyage and came from Tyre to Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed a day with them. "},{"num":8,"verse":"On the next day we resumed the trip and came to Caesarea, where we went to the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with him.

When the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from the province of Asia noticed him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd, and laid hands on him, "},{"num":28,"verse":"shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help us. This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place, and what is more, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this sacred place.” "},{"num":29,"verse":"For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him and supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
