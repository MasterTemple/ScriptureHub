[{"header":"Paul Sails for Rome"},{"num":27,"verse":"It was decided that we would sail for Italy. An ·officer [centurion] named Julius, who served in the ·emperor’s army [Imperial/Augustan regiment; a military unit directly under Caesar], ·guarded [took charge of] Paul and some other prisoners. "},{"num":2,"verse":"We got on a ship that was from the city of Adramyttium [a seaport on the northwest coast of Asia Minor] and was about to sail to different ports in Asia [a Roman province, in present-day Turkey]. Aristarchus [19:29; 20:4; Col. 4:10; Philem. 24], a man from the city of Thessalonica [17:1] in Macedonia [16:9], went with us. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The next day we ·came to [landed at] Sidon [12:20]. Julius was very ·good [kind; considerate] to Paul and gave him freedom to go visit his friends, who took care of his needs. "},{"num":4,"verse":"We left Sidon and sailed ·close to [to the north of; under the lee/shelter of] the island of Cyprus [11:19], because the wind was blowing against us. "},{"num":5,"verse":"We ·went [sailed] across the sea by Cilicia [6:9; 9:11] and Pamphylia [13:13] and landed at the city of Myra [a significant city on the Andracus River] in Lycia [a province in southeastern Asia Minor]. "},{"num":6,"verse":"There the ·officer [centurion] found a ship from Alexandria [a major city in Egypt] that was going to Italy, so he put us on it."},{"num":7,"verse":"We sailed slowly for many days. We had a hard time reaching Cnidus [a port on the southwest side of Asia Minor] because the wind was blowing against us, and we could not go any farther. So we sailed ·by the south side [under the shelter/lee] of the island of Crete [a large island off the southern coast of Asia Minor] near Salmone [a promontory on the eastern coast of Crete, present-day Cape Sidero]. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Sailing past it was hard. Then we came to a place called Fair Havens [a bay on the southern coast of Crete], near the ·city [town] of Lasea [a nearby Cretan city]."},{"num":9,"verse":"We had lost much time, and it was now dangerous to sail, because it was already after ·the Day of Cleansing [the Fast; the Day of Atonement; Yom Kippur in Hebrew; Lev. 16; either late September or early October]. So Paul ·warned [advised] them, "},{"num":10,"verse":"“Men, I can see there will be ·a lot of trouble [disaster and heavy loss] on this trip. The ship, the cargo, and even our lives may be lost.” "},{"num":11,"verse":"But the centurion was more persuaded by the ·captain [pilot] and the owner of the ship than by what Paul said. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Since that harbor was not a ·good [suitable; safe] place for the ship to stay for the winter, ·most of the men [the majority] decided that the ship ·should leave [put to sea]. They hoped we could go to Phoenix and stay there for the winter. Phoenix, a ·city [or port; or harbor] on the island of Crete, had a harbor which faced southwest and northwest."},{"header":"The Storm"},{"num":13,"verse":"When a ·good [moderate; gentle] wind began to blow from the south, the men on the ship thought they ·could reach their goal [or had achieved their objective; or had the opportunity they were waiting for]. So they pulled up the anchor, and we sailed very close to the island of Crete. "},{"num":14,"verse":"But ·then [not long after this] a ·very strong [violent; hurricane-like] wind named the “northeaster” came from ·the island [it]. "},{"num":15,"verse":"The ship was caught in it and could not sail against it. So we stopped trying and ·let the wind carry us [were driven along]. "},{"num":16,"verse":"When we went ·below [under the lee/shelter of] a small island named Cauda [23 miles off the south coast of Crete], we were barely able to bring in the lifeboat. "},{"num":17,"verse":"After the men took the lifeboat in, they tied ·ropes [or cables] ·around [or under] the ship to hold it together. The men were afraid that the ship would ·hit [run aground on] the sandbanks of Syrtis [off the coast of North Africa], so they lowered the ·sail [or sea anchor; gear] and let the wind carry the ship. "},{"num":18,"verse":"The next day the storm was blowing us so hard that the men threw out some of the cargo. "},{"num":19,"verse":"·A day later [On the third day] with their own hands they threw out the ship’s ·equipment [rigging; tackle; gear]. "},{"num":20,"verse":"When we could not see the sun or the stars for many days, and ·the storm was very bad [no small storm raged], we lost all hope of being saved."},{"num":21,"verse":"After ·the men [many] had ·gone without food [or lost their appetite] for a long time, Paul stood up before them and said, “Men, you should have ·listened to me [obeyed me; taken my advice]. You should not have sailed from Crete. Then you would not have all this trouble and loss. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But now I ·tell [urge; advise] you to ·cheer up [keep up your courage] because none of you will ·die [be lost]. Only the ship will be lost. "},{"num":23,"verse":"·Last [This] night an angel ·came to [stood by] me from the God I belong to and worship. "},{"num":24,"verse":"The angel said, ‘Paul, do not be afraid.

[For] I trust in God that everything will happen as ·his angel told me [I have been told].

About ·midnight [the middle of the night] the sailors thought we were close to land, "},{"num":28,"verse":"so they ·lowered a rope with a weight on the end of it into the water [took a sounding]. They found that the water was one hundred twenty feet deep [twenty fathoms]. They went a little farther and ·lowered the rope again [took a sounding]. It was ninety feet [fifteen fathoms] deep. "},{"num":29,"verse":"·The sailors [They] were afraid that we would ·hit the rocks [run aground], so they threw four anchors ·into the water [from the stern] and prayed for daylight to come. "},{"num":30,"verse":"Some of the sailors wanted to leave the ship, and they lowered the lifeboat, pretending they were throwing more anchors from the ·front of the ship [bow]. "},{"num":31,"verse":"But Paul told the ·officer [centurion] and the other soldiers, “If these men do not stay in the ship, your lives cannot be saved.” "},{"num":32,"verse":"So the soldiers cut the ropes and let the lifeboat fall into the water."},{"num":33,"verse":"Just before dawn Paul ·began persuading [begged; encouraged; urged] all the people to ·eat something [take food]. He said, “·For the past fourteen days [Today is the fourteenth day] you have been ·waiting and watching [in suspense] and ·not eating [going without food, taking nothing]. "},{"num":34,"verse":"Now I ·beg [urge; encourage] you to ·eat something [take food]. You need it to ·stay alive [survive]. None of you will lose even one hair off your heads.” "},{"num":35,"verse":"After he said this, Paul took some bread and thanked God for it before all of them. He broke off a piece and began eating [reflecting language associated with the Lord’s Supper]. "},{"num":36,"verse":"They all felt ·better [encouraged] and ·started eating [took bread], too. "},{"num":37,"verse":"·There were [We were in all] two hundred seventy-six people on the ship.

"},{"num":40,"verse":"So they ·cut the ropes to [cast off] the anchors and left ·the anchors [them] in the sea. At the same time, they untied the ropes that were holding the rudders. Then they raised the front sail into the wind and sailed toward the beach. "},{"num":41,"verse":"But the ship hit a ·sandbank [reef; shoal; or cross-current; place of two seas]. The front of the ship stuck there and could not move, but the ·back of the ship [stern] began to break up from the big waves."},{"num":42,"verse":"The soldiers ·decided [made a decision] to kill the prisoners so none of them could swim away and escape. "},{"num":43,"verse":"But ·Julius, the officer, [the centurion] wanted to ·let Paul live [save Paul] and ·did not allow the soldiers to kill the prisoners [stopped them from their plan].
