"},{"num":3,"verse":"The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to receive their care. "},{"num":4,"verse":"When we had put out to sea from there, we sailed along the northern coast of Cyprus because the winds were against us. "},{"num":5,"verse":"After sailing through the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia. "},{"num":6,"verse":"There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Sailing slowly for many days, we came with difficulty as far as Cnidus. Since the wind did not allow us to approach it, we sailed along the south side of Crete off Salmone.
