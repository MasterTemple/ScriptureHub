"},{"num":4,"verse":"But they stared straight at him; and Kefa said, “Look at us!” "},{"num":5,"verse":"The crippled man fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Kefa said, “I don’t have silver, and I don’t have gold, but what I do have I give to you: in the name of the Messiah, Yeshua of Natzeret, walk!” "},{"num":7,"verse":"And taking hold of him by his right hand, Kefa pulled him up.
