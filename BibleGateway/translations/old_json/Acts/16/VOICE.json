[{"num":1,"verse":"When Paul reached Derbe and Lystra, he invited a disciple named Timothy to join him and Silas. Timothy had a good reputation among the believers in Lystra and Iconium, but there was a problem: although Timothy’s mother was a believing Jew, his father was Greek, which meant Timothy was uncircumcised. Because the Jewish people of those cities knew he was the son of a Greek man, Paul felt it would be best for Timothy to be circumcised before proceeding."},{"num":4,"verse":"Leaving there, now accompanied by Timothy, they delivered to the churches in each town the decisions and instructions given by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.

We stayed in Philippi for several days. "},{"num":13,"verse":"On the Sabbath day, we went outside the city walls to the nearby river, assuming that some Jewish people might be gathering for prayer. We found a group of women there, so we sat down and spoke to them. "},{"num":14,"verse":"One of them, Lydia, was a business woman originally from Thyatira. She made a living buying and selling fine purple fabric. She was a true worshiper of God and listened to Paul with special interest. The Lord opened her heart to take in the message with enthusiasm. "},{"num":15,"verse":"She and her whole household were ceremonially washed through baptism."},{"num":16,"verse":"One day, as we were going to the place set aside for prayer, we encountered a slave girl.

The prisoners in adjoining cells are wide awake, listening to them pray and sing. "},{"num":26,"verse":"Suddenly the ground begins to shake, and the prison foundations begin to crack.

"},{"num":27,"verse":"The jailer wakes up and runs into the jail. His heart sinks as he sees the doors have all swung open. He is sure his prisoners have escaped, and he knows this will mean death for him, so he pulls out his sword to commit suicide.
