His mother’s name was Jehoaddin, and she was from Jerusalem. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Amaziah did what ·the Lord said was right [was pleasing/proper in the eyes/sight of the Lord], but ·he did not really want to obey him [not wholeheartedly]. "},{"num":3,"verse":"As soon as Amaziah ·took strong [secured; established] control of the kingdom, he executed the officers who had ·murdered [assassinated] his father the king. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But Amaziah did not put to death their children. He obeyed what was written in the law in the ·Book [scroll] of Moses, where the Lord commanded, “·Parents [Fathers] must not be put to death ·when their children do wrong [for sons], and ·children [sons] must not be put to death ·when their parents do wrong [for fathers].

"},{"num":7,"verse":"But a man of God [prophet] came to Amaziah and said, “My king, don’t let the army of Israel go with you.

He bowed down to them and ·offered sacrifices [burned incense] to them. "},{"num":15,"verse":"The ·Lord was very angry with [Lord’s anger burned against] Amaziah, ·so [and] he sent a prophet to him who said, “Why have you asked their gods for help?

Then he sent a message to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, who was the son of Jehu king of Israel. Amaziah said to Jehoash, “Come, let’s meet face to face [possibly a call to negotiate, but more likely a challenge to battle].”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Then Jehoash king of Israel answered Amaziah king of Judah, “A ·thornbush [thistle] in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree in Lebanon. It said, ‘Let your daughter marry my son.’ But then a wild animal from Lebanon came by, ·walking on and crushing [trampling] the ·thornbush [thistle].

Don’t ask for trouble, or you and Judah will ·be defeated [fall].”"},{"num":20,"verse":"But Amaziah would not listen. God caused this to happen so that Jehoash would defeat Judah, because Judah ·asked for help from [sought; followed] the gods of Edom. "},{"num":21,"verse":"So Jehoash king of Israel went to attack. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Israel defeated Judah, and every man of Judah ran away to his ·home [tent].
