Nothing was hidden from him; he could explain everything to her. "},{"num":3,"verse":"When she discovered how wise he really was, and how breathtaking the beauty of his palace, "},{"num":4,"verse":"and how wonderful the food at his tables, and how many servants and aides he had, and when she saw their spectacular uniforms and his stewards in full regalia, and saw the size of the men in his bodyguard, she could scarcely believe it!"},{"num":5,"verse":"Finally she exclaimed to the king, “Everything I heard about you in my own country is true! "},{"num":6,"verse":"I didn’t believe it until I got here and saw it with my own eyes. Your wisdom is far greater than I could ever have imagined.

"},{"num":18,"verse":"It had six gold steps and a footstool of gold; also gold armrests, each flanked by a gold lion. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Gold lions also stood at each side of each step. No other throne in all the world could be compared with it! "},{"num":20,"verse":"All of King Solomon’s cups were solid gold, as were all the furnishings in the Forest of Lebanon Room.
