[{"num":22,"verse":"Forsooth the dwellers of Jerusalem ordained Ahaziah, the youngest son of Jehoram, to be king for him; for the thieves of Arabia, that felled into the castles of Judah, had slain all his greater, or elder brethren, which were begotten before him. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, reigned. (And the inhabitants of Jerusalem ordained Ahaziah, the youngest son of Jehoram, to be king for him; for the Arab thieves, who fell upon the tents, or the camps, of Judah, had killed all his elder brothers, who were born before him. And so Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, reigned.)"},{"num":2,"verse":"Ahaziah was of two and forty years (Ahaziah was twenty-two years old), when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; the name of his mother was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri."},{"num":3,"verse":"But he entered by the way of the house of Ahab (But he went in the ways of the house of Ahab); for his mother compelled him to do evil."},{"num":4,"verse":"Therefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as the house of Ahab; for they were counsellors to him into his perishing, after the death of his father; (And so he did evil before the Lord, like the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after his father’s death, yea, unto his perishing;)"},{"num":5,"verse":"and he went in the counsel of them.

Therefore Ahaziah, king of Judah, the son of Jehoram, went down to visit Joram, the son of Ahab, that was sick in Jezreel; (who returned home to Jezreel to recover; for he had received many wounds in the foresaid battle.
