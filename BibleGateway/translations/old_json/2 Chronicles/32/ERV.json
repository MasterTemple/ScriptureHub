[{"header":"The King of Assyria Attacks Judah"},{"num":32,"verse":"After Hezekiah had faithfully done everything the Lord commanded, King Sennacherib of Assyria came to attack the country of Judah.

He met with these officers at the open place near the city gate. He talked to the officers and encouraged them. He said, “Be strong and brave.

There is a greater power with us than the king of Assyria has with him!"},{"num":8,"verse":"The king of Assyria only has men. But we have the Lord our God with us! Our God will help us.

He told you people of Judah and Jerusalem that you must worship and burn incense on only one altar."},{"num":13,"verse":"Of course, you know what my ancestors and I have done to all the peoples in other countries. The gods of the other countries could not save their people. Those gods could not stop me from destroying their people."},{"num":14,"verse":"My ancestors destroyed those countries. There is no god that can stop me from destroying his people. So you think your god can save you from me?"},{"num":15,"verse":"Don’t let Hezekiah fool you or trick you.

He prayed to the Lord, and he spoke to Hezekiah and gave him a sign."},{"num":25,"verse":"But Hezekiah’s heart was proud, so he did not give God thanks for his kindness. This is why God was angry with Hezekiah and with the people of Judah and Jerusalem."},{"num":26,"verse":"But Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem changed their hearts and lives.
