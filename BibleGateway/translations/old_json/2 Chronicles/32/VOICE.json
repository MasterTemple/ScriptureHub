"},{"num":17,"verse":"The Assyrian king himself wrote additional letters insulting the Eternal God of Israel, reminding the people that no god had ever saved his people from the Assyrians, and Israel’s God couldn’t either. Furthermore, Sennacherib wrote that God was a creation of humans, just as all the other pagan gods are.

The messengers thought their words would terrify and disturb the people into surrendering the city."},{"num":20,"verse":"But King Hezekiah and Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz, were not threatened by the Assyrians’ words.
