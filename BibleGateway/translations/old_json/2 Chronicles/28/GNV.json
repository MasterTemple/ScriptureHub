[{"num":28,"verse":"1 Ahaz an idolater is given into the hands of the Syrians and the king of Israel. 9 The Prophet reproveth the Israelites’ cruelty. 18 Judah is molested with enemies. 23 Ahaz

and all the Congregation."},{"num":15,"verse":"And the men that were named by name, rose up and took the prisoners, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them meat, and gave them drink, and anointed them, and carried all that were feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho the city of Palm trees to their brethren: so
