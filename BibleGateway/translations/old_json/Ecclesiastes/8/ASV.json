"},{"num":3,"verse":"Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

"},{"num":5,"verse":"Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment: "},{"num":6,"verse":"for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him: "},{"num":7,"verse":"for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?
