[{"num":8,"verse":"Who is such as a wise man? and who knoweth the solving, either expounding, of a word? The wisdom of a man shineth in his cheer; and the mightiest shall change his face (The wisdom of a person shineth in their face; and maketh even the mightiest to change his expression, or his countenance)."},{"num":2,"verse":"I keep the mouth of the king, and the commandments and [the] swearings of God. (I counsel, or advice, thee to obey the kingâ€™s commands, and to keep your oath, or your pledge, to God.)"},{"num":3,"verse":"Haste thou not to go away from his face, and dwell thou not in evil work. For he shall do all thing, that he will (For he shall do anything, that he desireth);"},{"num":4,"verse":"and his word is full of power, and no man may say to him (and no one can say to him), Why doest thou so?"},{"num":5,"verse":"He that keepeth the commandment of God, shall not feel anything of evil; the heart of a wise man understandeth time and answer."},{"num":6,"verse":"Time and season is to each work; and much torment is of a man,"},{"num":7,"verse":"for he knoweth not [the] things passed, and he may not know by any messenger [the] things to come."},{"num":8,"verse":"It is not in the power of man to forbid the spirit, that is, his soul, from going out from the body, neither he hath power in the day of death, neither he is suffered to have rest, when the battle nigheth; neither wickedness shall save a wicked man."},{"num":9,"verse":"I beheld all these things, and I gave mine heart in(to) all works, that be done under the sun.

Just men there be, to whom evils come, as if they did the works of wicked men; and wicked men there be, that be as secure, as if they had (done) the deeds of just men; but I deem also this most vain.
