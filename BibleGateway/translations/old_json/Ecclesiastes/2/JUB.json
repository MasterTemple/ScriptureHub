[{"num":2,"verse":"¶ I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy good things; and, behold, this also is vanity."},{"num":2,"verse":"I said of laughter, It is mad, and of mirth, What does it do?"},{"num":3,"verse":"I proposed in my heart to regale my flesh with wine and that my heart would walk in wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, until I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life."},{"num":4,"verse":"I made myself great works; I built myself houses; I planted myself vineyards;"},{"num":5,"verse":"I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits;"},{"num":6,"verse":"I made myself pools of water, to water with them the forest that brings forth trees;"},{"num":7,"verse":"I got myself slaves and maidens and had sons born in my house; also I had great possessions of cattle and sheep above all that were in Jerusalem before me;"},{"num":8,"verse":"I gathered unto myself also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces; I obtained men singers and women singers and all the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and those of all sorts."},{"num":9,"verse":"So I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem, and more than that, my wisdom remained with me."},{"num":10,"verse":"And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour, and this was my portion of all my labour."},{"num":11,"verse":"At last I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that I had laboured to do; and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun."},{"num":12,"verse":"¶ And I turned myself to behold wisdom and those who are mad, and folly; for what can the man do that comes after the king? even that which has already been done."},{"num":13,"verse":"And I have seen that wisdom excels folly as far as light excels darkness."},{"num":14,"verse":"The wise man has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness: And I myself also understood that one event happens to the one and to the other."},{"num":15,"verse":"Then I said in my heart, As it shall happen to the fool, so it shall happen even to me.
