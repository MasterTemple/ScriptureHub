[{"header":"The Futility of Life"},{"num":6,"verse":"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily on men: "},{"num":2,"verse":"a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God has not given him the power or capacity to enjoy them [all those things which are gifts from God], but a stranger [in whom he has no interest succeeds him and] enjoys them. This is vanity and it is a [cause of] great distress.
