No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before him."},{"num":2,"verse":"All things come alike to all: there is one event that happeneth to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that doth not sacrifice: As is the good, so is the sinner, and he that taketh an oath, as he that feareth an oath."},{"num":3,"verse":"This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun: that there is one event that happeneth unto all. Yea, also the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live; and after that they go to the dead."},{"num":4,"verse":"For him that is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion."},{"num":5,"verse":"For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."},{"num":6,"verse":"Also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun."},{"num":7,"verse":"Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works."},{"num":8,"verse":"Let thy garments be always white, and let thy head lack no ointment."},{"num":9,"verse":"Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which He hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity; for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labor which thou hast done under the sun."},{"num":10,"verse":"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest."},{"num":11,"verse":"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all."},{"num":12,"verse":"For man also knoweth not his time: As the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon them."},{"num":13,"verse":"This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:"},{"num":14,"verse":"There was a little city and few men within it.
