[{"num":9,"verse":"For I have thought of all this, how good and wise men and their works are in the hand of God. Man does not know if love or hate is waiting for them."},{"num":2,"verse":"It is the same for all. The same thing will happen to both the man who is good and the man who is sinful. The same thing will happen to the clean and the unclean, and to the man who gives a gift on the altar and to the man who does not. As the good man is, so is the sinner. As the man who swears is, so is the one who is afraid to swear. "},{"num":3,"verse":"This is a bad thing in all that is done under the sun, that the same thing happens to all men. Also the hearts of men are sinful and crazy all their lives. Then they join the dead. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But there is hope for the one who is among the living.
