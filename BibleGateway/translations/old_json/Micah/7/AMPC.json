They all lie in wait for blood; each hunts his brother with a net."},{"num":3,"verse":"Both their hands are put forth and are upon what is evil to do it diligently; the prince and the judge ask for a bribe, and the great man utters his evil desire. Thus they twist between them [the course of justice]."},{"num":4,"verse":"The best of them is like a brier; the most upright or the straightest is like a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen, even of [God’s] judgment and your punishment, has come; now shall be their perplexity and confusion."},{"num":5,"verse":"Trust not in a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom."},{"num":6,"verse":"For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—a man’s enemies are the men (members) of his own house."},{"num":7,"verse":"But as for me, I will look to the Lord and confident in Him I will keep watch; I will wait with hope and expectancy for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me."},{"num":8,"verse":"Rejoice not against me, O my enemy!

He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold His righteous deliverance."},{"num":10,"verse":"Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her who said to me, Where is the Lord your God? My eyes will see my desire upon her; now she will be trodden down as the mire of the streets."},{"num":11,"verse":"In the day that your walls are to be built [a day for building], in that day shall the boundary [of Israel] be far extended and the decree [against her] be far removed."},{"num":12,"verse":"In that day they will come to you from Assyria and from the cities of Matzor [Egypt] and from Egypt even to the river [Euphrates], from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain."},{"num":13,"verse":"Yet shall the earth be desolate because of those who dwell in it, for the fruit of their doings."},{"num":14,"verse":"Rule and feed Your people with Your rod and scepter, the flock of Your inheritance who dwell alone in a forest in the midst of Carmel [a garden land]; they shall feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old."},{"num":15,"verse":"As in the days of your coming forth from the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things."},{"num":16,"verse":"The nations shall see [God’s deliverance] and be ashamed of all their might [which cannot be compared to His].

You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea."},{"num":20,"verse":"You will show Your faithfulness and perform the sure promise to Jacob and loving-kindness and mercy to Abraham, as You have sworn to our fathers from the days of old."}]
