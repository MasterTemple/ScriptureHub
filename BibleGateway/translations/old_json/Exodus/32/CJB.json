[{"num":32,"verse":"When the people saw that Moshe was taking a long time to come down from the mountain, they gathered around Aharon and said to him, “Get busy; and make us gods to go ahead of us; because this Moshe, the man that brought us up from the land of Egypt — we don’t know what has become of him.” "},{"num":2,"verse":"Aharon said to them, “Have your wives, sons and daughters strip off their gold earrings; and bring them to me.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"The people stripped off their gold earrings and brought them to Aharon.

Afterwards, the people sat down to eat and drink; then they got up to indulge in revelry."},{"num":7,"verse":"Adonai said to Moshe, “Go down! Hurry! Your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have become corrupt! "},{"num":8,"verse":"So quickly they have turned aside from the way I ordered them to follow! They have cast a metal statue of a calf, worshipped it, sacrificed to it and said, ‘Isra’el! Here is your god, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!’” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Adonai continued speaking to Moshe: “I have been watching these people; and you can see how stiffnecked they are.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"When Y’hoshua heard the noise of the people shouting he said to Moshe, “It sounds like war in the camp!” "},{"num":18,"verse":"He answered, “That is neither the clamor of victory nor the wailings of defeat; what I hear is the sound of people singing.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"But the moment Moshe got near the camp, when he saw the calf and the dancing, his own anger blazed up. He threw down the tablets he had been holding and shattered them at the base of the mountain.

I threw it in the fire, and out came this calf!”"},{"num":25,"verse":"When Moshe saw that the people had gotten out of control — because Aharon had allowed them to get out of control, to the derision of their enemies — "},{"num":26,"verse":"Moshe stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, “Whoever is for Adonai, come to me!” All the descendants of Levi rallied around him.

Now I will go up to Adonai ; maybe I will be able to atone for your sin.” "},{"num":31,"verse":"Moshe went back to Adonai and said, “Please! These people have committed a terrible sin: they have made themselves a god out of gold. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Now, if you will just forgive their sin!
