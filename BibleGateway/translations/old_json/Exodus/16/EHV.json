"},{"num":3,"verse":"The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the Lord’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat around pots of meat and ate as much food as we wanted, but now you have brought us out into this wilderness to have this whole community die of hunger.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Watch what I will do. I will rain down bread from heaven for you, and the people will go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test whether they will follow my instructions or not. "},{"num":5,"verse":"On the sixth day they will prepare what they bring in, and it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “At evening you will know that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, "},{"num":7,"verse":"and in the morning you will see the Glory of the Lord, because he has heard your constant grumbling against the Lord. Who are we that you should grumble against us?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Moses said, “Now the Lord will give you meat to eat in the evening and as much bread as you want in the morning, because the Lord has heard your grumbling against him.

"},{"num":23,"verse":"He said to them, “This is what the Lord has said: Tomorrow is a complete rest, a holy sabbath to the Lord. Bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil, but set aside for yourselves all the rest of it to be kept until morning.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"So they set it aside until morning as Moses commanded, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Moses said, “Today eat whatever is left over, for today is a sabbath to the Lord. Today you will not find any around the camp.
