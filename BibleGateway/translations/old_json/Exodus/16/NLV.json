The people will go out and gather a day’s share every day, so I may test them to see if they will follow My Law or not. "},{"num":5,"verse":"On the sixth day they are to bring in twice as much as they gather each day.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"So Moses and Aaron said to the people of Israel, “This evening you will know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And in the morning you will see the greatness of the Lord. For He hears your complaining against the Lord. What are we, that you complain against us?” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Moses said, “The Lord is giving you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning.
