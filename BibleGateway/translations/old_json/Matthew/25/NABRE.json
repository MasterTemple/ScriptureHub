Come out to meet him!’ "},{"num":7,"verse":"Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ "},{"num":9,"verse":"But the wise ones replied, ‘No, for there may not be enough for us and you. Go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.’ "},{"num":10,"verse":"While they went off to buy it, the bridegroom came and those who were ready went into the wedding feast with him. Then the door was locked.
