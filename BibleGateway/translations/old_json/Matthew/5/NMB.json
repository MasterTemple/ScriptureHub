"},{"num":2,"verse":"And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:"},{"num":13,"verse":"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has lost her saltness, what can be salted with it? It is thereafter good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden underfoot by men."},{"num":14,"verse":"You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it gives light to all who are in the house. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven."},{"num":17,"verse":"Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets.
