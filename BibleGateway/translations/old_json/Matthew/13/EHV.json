[{"header":"The Parable of the Sower"},{"num":13,"verse":"That same day Jesus left the house and was sitting by the sea. "},{"num":2,"verse":"A large crowd gathered around him.

"},{"num":4,"verse":"As he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. Immediately the seed sprang up, because the soil was not deep. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But when the sun rose, the seed was scorched. Because it had no root, it withered away. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked it. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But some seed fell on good ground and produced grain: some one hundred times, some sixty, and some thirty times more than was sown. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"The disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"He answered them, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but it has not been given to them.
