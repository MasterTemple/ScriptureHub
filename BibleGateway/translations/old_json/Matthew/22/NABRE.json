Jesus again in reply spoke to them in parables, saying, "},{"num":2,"verse":"“The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son. "},{"num":3,"verse":"He dispatched his servants to summon the invited guests to the feast, but they refused to come. "},{"num":4,"verse":"A second time he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those invited: “Behold, I have prepared my banquet, my calves and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready; come to the feast.”’ "},{"num":5,"verse":"Some ignored the invitation and went away, one to his farm, another to his business. "},{"num":6,"verse":"The rest laid hold of his servants, mistreated them, and killed them. "},{"num":7,"verse":"The king was enraged and sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he said to his servants, ‘The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Go out, therefore, into the main roads and invite to the feast whomever you find.’ "},{"num":10,"verse":"The servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found, bad and good alike, and the hall was filled with guests. "},{"num":11,"verse":"But when the king came in to meet the guests he saw a man there not dressed in a wedding garment.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"They sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. And you are not concerned with anyone’s opinion, for you do not regard a person’s status. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Tell us, then, what is your opinion: Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not?” "},{"num":18,"verse":"Knowing their malice, Jesus said, “Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?

They put this question to him, "},{"num":24,"verse":"saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies without children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up descendants for his brother.’ "},{"num":25,"verse":"Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died and, having no descendants, left his wife to his brother. "},{"num":26,"verse":"The same happened with the second and the third, through all seven.

For they all had been married to her.” "},{"num":29,"verse":"Jesus said to them in reply, “You are misled because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God. "},{"num":30,"verse":"At the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven.
