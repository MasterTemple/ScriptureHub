"},{"num":3,"verse":"So also we [whether Jews or Gentiles], when we were children (spiritually immature), were kept like slaves under the elementary [man-made religious or philosophical] teachings of the world. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But when [in God’s plan] the proper time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the [regulations of the] Law, "},{"num":5,"verse":"so that He might redeem and liberate those who were under the Law, that we [who believe] might be adopted as sons [as God’s children with all rights as fully grown members of a family]. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And because you [really] are [His] sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba!
