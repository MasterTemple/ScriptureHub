When we were juveniles we were enslaved under the hostile spirits of the world. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But when the time of fulfillment had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law.

My true Father!”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Now we’re no longer living like slaves under the law, but we enjoy being God’s very own sons and daughters! And because we’re his, we can access everything our Father has—for we are heirs because of what God has done!"},{"num":8,"verse":"Before we knew God as our Father, we were unwitting servants to the powers that be, which are nothing compared to God.

Where is that kindhearted and free spirit now?

They want to win you over so you will side with them. They want you divided from me so you will follow only them. Would you call that integrity?

The first covenant was born on Mount Sinai, birthing children into slavery—children born to Hagar. "},{"num":25,"verse":"For “Hagar” represents the law given at Mount Sinai in Arabia. The “Hagar” metaphor corresponds to the earthly Jerusalem of today who are currently in bondage."},{"num":26,"verse":"In contrast, there is a heavenly Jerusalem above us, which is our true “mother.” She is the freewoman, birthing children into freedom!
