When I preached, I clearly showed you that Jesus Christ had been nailed to the cross. "},{"num":2,"verse":"I would like to learn just one thing from you. Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law? Or did you receive the Spirit by believing what you heard? "},{"num":3,"verse":"Are you so foolish? You began by the Holy Spirit. Are you now trying to finish God’s work in you by your own strength? "},{"num":4,"verse":"Have you experienced so much for nothing? And was it really for nothing? "},{"num":5,"verse":"So I ask you again, how does God give you his Spirit? How does he work miracles among you? Is it by doing what the law says? Or is it by believing what you have heard? "},{"num":6,"verse":"In the same way, Abraham “believed God. God was pleased with Abraham because he believed. So his faith made him right with God.” (Genesis 15:6)"},{"num":7,"verse":"So you see, those who have faith are children of Abraham.

This is because “the one who is right with God will live by faith.” (Habakkuk 2:4) "},{"num":12,"verse":"The law is not based on faith. In fact, it is just the opposite. It teaches that “the person who does these things will live by them.” (Leviticus 18:5) "},{"num":13,"verse":"Christ set us free from the curse of the law. He did it by becoming a curse for us.

No one can get rid of an official agreement between people. No one can add to it. It can’t be changed after it has been made. It is the same with God’s covenant agreement. "},{"num":16,"verse":"The promises were given to Abraham. They were also given to his seed. Scripture does not say, “and to seeds.” That means many people.

Then people could become right with God by obeying the law. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin. It does so in order that what was promised might be given to those who believe. The promise comes through faith in Jesus Christ."},{"header":"Children of God"},{"num":23,"verse":"Before faith in Christ came, we were guarded by the law.
