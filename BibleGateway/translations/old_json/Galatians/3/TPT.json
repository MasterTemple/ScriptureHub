Did God not open your eyes to see the meaning of Jesus’ crucifixion? Was he not revealed to you as the crucified one?"},{"num":2,"verse":"So answer me this: Did the Holy Spirit come to you as a reward for keeping Jewish laws? No, you received him as a gift because you believed in the Messiah. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Your new life began when the Holy Spirit gave you a new birth. Why then would you so foolishly turn from living in the Spirit by trying to finish by your own works?"},{"num":4,"verse":"Have you endured so many trials and persecutions for nothing?"},{"num":5,"verse":"Let me ask you again: What does the lavish supply of the Holy Spirit in your life and the miracles of God’s tremendous power have to do with you keeping religious laws? The Holy Spirit is poured out upon us through the revelation and power of faith!"},{"num":6,"verse":"Abraham, our father of faith, believed God, and the substance of his faith released God’s righteousness to him. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So the true children of Abraham have the same faith as their father! "},{"num":8,"verse":"And the Scripture prophesied that on the basis of faith God would declare gentiles to be righteous. God announced the good news ahead of time to Abraham:"},{"num":9,"verse":"And so the blessing of Abraham’s faith is now our blessing too!

For it is clearly written:"},{"num":11,"verse":"It is obvious that no one achieves the righteousness of God by attempting to keep the law, for it is written:"},{"num":12,"verse":"But keeping the law does not require faith, but self-effort.

Technically, when a contract is signed, it can’t be changed after it has been put into effect; it’s too late to alter the agreement."},{"num":16,"verse":"Remember the royal proclamation God spoke over Abraham and to Abraham’s child? God said that his promises were made to pass on to Abraham’s “Child,” not children. And who is this “Child?” It’s the Son of promise, Christ himself!"},{"num":17,"verse":"This means that the covenant between God and Abraham was fulfilled in Messiah and cannot be altered. Yet the written law was not even given to Moses until 430 years after God had “signed” his contract with Abraham! The law, then, doesn’t supersede the promise since the royal proclamation was given before the law."},{"num":19,"verse":"Why then was the law given at all? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the “Seed,” the child who was promised. When God gave the law, he gave it first to angels; they gave it to Moses, his mediator, who then gave it to the people.

How absurd! Truly, if there was a law that we could keep which would give us new life, then our salvation would have come by law-keeping.
