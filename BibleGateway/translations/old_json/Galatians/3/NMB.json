[{"num":3,"verse":"O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, such that you should not believe the truth – you to whom Jesus Christ was described before the eyes, and among you crucified?"},{"num":2,"verse":"This only would I learn from you: did you receive the Spirit by the deeds of the law, or by the preaching of the faith? "},{"num":3,"verse":"Are you so unwise that after you have begun in the Spirit, you would now end in the flesh? "},{"num":4,"verse":"So many things then you have suffered in vain, if that be vain! "},{"num":5,"verse":"He who ministered to you the Spirit and works miracles among you, does he do it through the deeds of the law, or by preaching of the faith? "},{"num":6,"verse":"It is even as Abraham believed God, and it was ascribed to him for righteousness. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Understand therefore that it is those who are of faith who are the children of Abraham."},{"num":8,"verse":"For the scripture foresaw that God would justify the heathen through faith, and therefore showed beforehand glad tidings to Abraham: In you shall all nations be blessed. "},{"num":9,"verse":"So then, those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. "},{"num":10,"verse":"For as many as are under the deeds of the law are under malediction. For it is written: Cursed is every one who does not continue in all the things that are written in the book of the law, to fulfil them."},{"num":11,"verse":"That no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for: The just shall live by faith. "},{"num":12,"verse":"The law is not of faith. (But: The man who fulfils the things contained in the law, will live in them.) "},{"num":13,"verse":"But Christ has delivered us from the curse of the law, and was made accursed for us – for it is written, cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree – "},{"num":14,"verse":"so that the blessing of Abraham may come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, and so that we may receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."},{"num":15,"verse":"Brethren, I will speak with reference to the custom of men. Though it be but a man’s last will and testament, yet no one sets it aside or adds anything to it once it is confirmed. "},{"num":16,"verse":"To Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He does not say, In the seeds, as in many, but, In your seed, as in one, which is Christ. "},{"num":17,"verse":"This I say: the law, which began afterwards (over 430 years), does not nullify the testament that was confirmed before by God in Christ, so as to make the promise of no effect. "},{"num":18,"verse":"For if the inheritance comes by the law, it does not come by promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise."},{"num":19,"verse":"For what then does the law serve? The law was added because of transgressions (till the seed came to whom the promise was made), and it was instituted by angels in the hand of a mediator. "},{"num":20,"verse":"A mediator is not a mediator of one. But God is one. "},{"num":21,"verse":"Is the law then against the promise of God? God forbid. However, if there had been a law given that could have given life, then no doubt righteousness would have come by the law. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But the scripture included all things under sin so that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, should be given to those who believe."},{"num":23,"verse":"Before faith came, we were kept and shut up under the law, with a view to the faith that would afterward be declared. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to the time of Christ, so that we may be made righteous by faith. "},{"num":25,"verse":"But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."},{"num":26,"verse":"For you are all the sons of God by the faith which is in Christ Jesus. "},{"num":27,"verse":"For all you who are baptized have put on Christ. "},{"num":28,"verse":"Now there is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither man nor woman, but you are all one thing in Christ Jesus. "},{"num":29,"verse":"If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs by promise."}]
