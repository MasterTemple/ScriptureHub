[{"num":5,"verse":"So stand strong for our freedom! The Anointed One freed us so we wouldn’t spend one more day under the yoke of slavery, trapped under the law."},{"num":2,"verse":"Listen because I, Paul, am going to make this message very clear so it cannot be misunderstood: if you undergo the rite of circumcision, then all that the Anointed accomplished will be lost on you. "},{"num":3,"verse":"And understand this: if you choose to be circumcised, then you will oblige yourself to do every single rule of the law for the rest of your life. "},{"num":4,"verse":"You, and anyone else who seeks to be on the right side of God through the law, have effectively been cut off from the Anointed, circumcised from grace, and cast off from the favor of God. "},{"num":5,"verse":"We, on the other hand, continue to live through the Spirit’s power and wait confidently in the hope that things will be put right through faith. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Here’s the thing: in Jesus the Anointed whether you are circumcised or not makes no difference. What makes a difference is faith energized by love."},{"num":7,"verse":"Who has impeded your progress and kept you from obeying the truth? You were off to such a good start. "},{"num":8,"verse":"I know for certain the pressure isn’t coming from God. He keeps calling you to the truth.

Besides, I also know that these troublemakers, whoever they are, will answer to God and be judged accordingly.

If I were to preach a compromised version of the good news, then the scandal of the cross would come to an end. "},{"num":12,"verse":"I really wish that these people who weigh you down with corrupt counsel would mutilate themselves!"},{"num":13,"verse":"Brothers and sisters, God has called you to freedom! Hear the call, and do not spoil this gift by using your liberty to engage in what your flesh desires; instead, use it to serve each other as Jesus taught through love. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For the whole law comes down to this one instruction: “Love your neighbor as yourself,” so "},{"num":15,"verse":"why all this vicious gnawing on each other? If you are not careful, you will find you’ve eaten each other alive!"},{"num":16,"verse":"Here’s my instruction: walk in the Spirit, and let the Spirit bring order to your life. If you do, you will never give in to your selfish and sinful cravings. "},{"num":17,"verse":"For everything the flesh desires goes against the Spirit, and everything the Spirit desires goes against the flesh.
