He shouted to his guards, “Arrest that man!” and shook his fist at him. Instantly the king’s arm became paralyzed in that position; he couldn’t pull it back again! "},{"num":5,"verse":"At the same moment a wide crack appeared in the altar and the ashes poured out, just as the prophet had said would happen. For this was the prophet’s proof that God had been speaking through him."},{"num":6,"verse":"“Oh, please, please,” the king cried out to the prophet, “beg the Lord your God to restore my arm again.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then the king said to the prophet, “Come to the palace with me and rest awhile and have some food; and I’ll give you a reward because you healed my arm.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"But the prophet said to the king, “Even if you gave me half your palace, I wouldn’t go into it; nor would I eat or drink even water in this place!

The Lord strictly warned me against it; and he also told me not to return home by the same road I came on.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"But the old man said, “I am a prophet too, just as you are; and an angel gave me a message from the Lord. I am to take you home with me and give you food and water.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"So they went back together, and the prophet ate some food and drank some water at the old man’s home."},{"num":20,"verse":"Then, suddenly, while they were sitting at the table, a message from the Lord came to the old man, "},{"num":21,"verse":"and he shouted at the prophet from Judah, “The Lord says that because you have been disobedient to his clear command and have come here, and have eaten and drunk water in the place he told you not to, therefore your body shall not be buried in the grave of your fathers.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"After finishing the meal, the old man saddled the prophet’s donkey, "},{"num":24,"verse":"and the prophet started off again.
