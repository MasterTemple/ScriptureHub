"},{"num":3,"verse":"The porch in front of the temple was twenty cubits in length, the same as the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house. "},{"num":4,"verse":"He made beveled windows for the house. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both of the temple and of the inner sanctuary, and he made side chambers all around. "},{"num":6,"verse":"The lowest story was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad. For around the outside of the house, he made offsets on the wall so that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house."},{"num":7,"verse":"The house was built of stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built."},{"num":8,"verse":"The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house, and it had winding stairs into the middle chamber and out of the middle into the third.

"},{"num":30,"verse":"He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, both inside and out."},{"num":31,"verse":"For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made doors of olive wood; the lintel and doorposts were five-sided. "},{"num":32,"verse":"The two doors were also made of olive wood. He carved on them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim and upon the palm trees. "},{"num":33,"verse":"So also he made for the entrance to the nave four-sided posts of olive wood. "},{"num":34,"verse":"The two doors were made from fir tree, with two leaves of each door folding.
