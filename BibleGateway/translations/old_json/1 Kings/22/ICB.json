Will you fight against the army of Aram at Ramoth in Gilead?”"},{"num":5,"verse":"But first we should ask the Lord to guide us.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Ahab called the prophets together. There were about 400 men. He asked them, “Should I go to war against the army of Aram at Ramoth in Gilead? Or should I wait?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the Lord here? Let’s ask him what we should do.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"King Ahab answered, “There is one other prophet. We could ask the Lord through him. But I hate him. When he prophesies, he never says anything good about me. He always says something bad. He is Micaiah, Imlah’s son.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So Ahab king of Israel told one of his officers to bring Micaiah to him at once."},{"num":10,"verse":"Ahab king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah had on their royal robes. They were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor. This was near the entrance to the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were standing before them, speaking messages from the Lord.

The king asked him, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth in Gilead or not?”"},{"num":16,"verse":"But Ahab said to Micaiah, “Tell me only the truth in the name of the Lord. How many times do I have to tell you this?”"},{"num":17,"verse":"So Micaiah answered, “I saw the army of Israel. They were scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd. The Lord said, ‘They have no leader. They should go home and not fight.’”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Then Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I told you! This prophet never says anything good about me. He only says bad things about me.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"But Micaiah continued to speak.

Send him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king’s son. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Tell them I said to put Micaiah in prison. Give him only bread and water for food. Keep him there until I come home from the battle.”"},{"num":28,"verse":"Micaiah said, “Ahab, if you come back safely from battle, the Lord has not spoken through me. Remember my words, all you people.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"So Ahab king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went to Ramoth in Gilead. "},{"num":30,"verse":"Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I will go into battle. But I will change my appearance so that no one will recognize me.

His blood flowed down and covered the bottom of the chariot. That evening he died. "},{"num":36,"verse":"Near sunset a cry went out through the army of Israel: “Each man go back to his own country and city.”"},{"num":37,"verse":"So in that way King Ahab died. His body was carried to Samaria and buried there. "},{"num":38,"verse":"The men cleaned Ahab’s chariot at a pool in Samaria. This was a pool where prostitutes bathed.
