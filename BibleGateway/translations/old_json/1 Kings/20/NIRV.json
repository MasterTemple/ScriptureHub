[{"header":"Ben-Hadad Attacks Samaria"},{"num":20,"verse":"Ben-Hadad brought his whole army together. He was king of Aram. He went up to Samaria.

I also commanded you to give me your wives and children. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But now I’m going to send my officials to you. They will come about this time tomorrow. They’ll search your palace. They’ll search the houses of your officials. They’ll take everything you value. And they’ll carry it all away.’ ”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The king of Israel sent for all the elders of the land. He said to them, “This man is really looking for trouble! He sent for my wives and children. He sent for my silver and gold.

Don’t agree to give him what he wants.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So Ahab replied to Ben-Hadad’s messengers. He said, “Tell my king and master, ‘I will do everything you commanded me to do the first time. But this time, I can’t do what you want me to do.’ ” They took Ahab’s answer back to Ben-Hadad."},{"num":10,"verse":"Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab. Ben-Hadad said, “There won’t be enough dust left in Samaria to give each of my followers even a handful. If there is, may the gods punish me greatly.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"The king of Israel replied.

The total number of officers was 232. Ahab gathered together the rest of the Israelites. The total number of them was 7,000. "},{"num":16,"verse":"They started out at noon.

"},{"num":24,"verse":"Here’s what you should do. Don’t let any of the kings continue as military leaders. Have other officers take their places. "},{"num":25,"verse":"You must also put another army together. It should be just like the one you lost. It should have the same number of horses and chariots. Then we’ll be able to fight against Israel on the plains. And we’ll certainly be stronger than they are.” Ben-Hadad agreed with their advice. He did what they suggested."},{"num":26,"verse":"The next spring Ben-Hadad brought together the men of Aram. They went up to the city of Aphek to fight against Israel. "},{"num":27,"verse":"The Israelites were also brought together. They were given supplies. They marched out to fight against their enemies. Israel’s army camped across from Aram’s army.

But the men of Aram covered the countryside."},{"num":28,"verse":"The man of God came up to the king of Israel again. He told him, “The Lord says, ‘The men of Aram think the Lord is a god of the hills. They do not think he is a god of the valleys. So I, the Lord, will hand their huge army over to you. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”"},{"num":29,"verse":"For seven days the two armies camped across from each other. On the seventh day the battle began.

So let’s go to the king of Israel. Let’s wear the rough clothing people wear when they’re sad. Let’s tie ropes around our heads. Perhaps Ahab will spare your life.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"So they wore rough clothing. They tied ropes around their heads. Then they went to the king of Israel. They told him, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’ ”"},{"num":33,"verse":"The men thought that was good news. So they quickly used the word Ahab had used. “Yes! Your friend Ben-Hadad!” they said."},{"num":34,"verse":"“I’ll return the cities my father took from your father,” Ben-Hadad offered. “You can set up your own market areas in Damascus.

Or you can pay 75 pounds of silver.’ "},{"num":40,"verse":"While I was busy here and there, the man disappeared.”"},{"num":41,"verse":"Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes.
