I and everything I have belong to you.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Then the messengers came to Ahab again. They said, “Ben-Hadad says, ‘I told you before that you must give me your silver and gold, your wives and your children. "},{"num":6,"verse":"About this time tomorrow I will send my men, who will search everywhere in your palace and in the homes of your officers. Whatever they want they will take and carry off.’”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then Ahab called a meeting of all the elders of his country. He said, “Ben-Hadad is looking for trouble. First he said I had to give him my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, and I have not refused him.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"The elders and all the people said, “Don’t listen to him or agree to this.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So Ahab said to Ben-Hadad’s messengers, “Tell my master the king: ‘I will do what you said at first, but I cannot allow this second command.’” And King Ben-Hadad’s men carried the message back to him."},{"num":10,"verse":"Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab: “May the gods punish me terribly if I don’t completely destroy Samaria. There won’t be enough left for each of my men to get a handful of dust!”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Ahab answered, “Tell Ben-Hadad, ‘The man who puts on his armor should not brag.

Since we fought in a mountain area, Israel won. Let’s fight them on the flat land, and then we will win. "},{"num":24,"verse":"This is what you should do. Don’t allow the thirty-two rulers to command the armies, but put other commanders in their places. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Gather an army like the one that was destroyed and as many horses and chariots as before. We will fight the Israelites on flat land, and then we will win.” Ben-Hadad agreed with their advice and did what they said."},{"num":26,"verse":"The next spring Ben-Hadad gathered the army of Aram and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel."},{"num":27,"verse":"The Israelites also had prepared for war. They marched out to meet the Arameans and camped opposite them. The Israelites looked like two small flocks of goats, but the Arameans covered the area."},{"num":28,"verse":"A man of God came to the king of Israel with this message: “The Lord says, ‘The people of Aram say that I, the Lord, am a god of the mountains, not a god of the valleys. So I will allow you to defeat this huge army, and then you will know I am the Lord.’”"},{"num":29,"verse":"The armies were camped across from each other for seven days. On the seventh day the battle began. The Israelites killed one hundred thousand Aramean soldiers in one day.

Ben-Hadad also ran away to the city and hid in a room."},{"num":31,"verse":"His officers said to him, “We have heard that the kings of Israel are trustworthy. Let’s dress in rough cloth to show our sadness, and wear ropes on our heads. Then we will go to the king of Israel, and perhaps he will let you live.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"So they dressed in rough cloth and wore ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel. They said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’”"},{"num":33,"verse":"Ben-Hadad’s men had wanted a sign from Ahab. So when Ahab called Ben-Hadad his brother, they quickly said, “Yes! Ben-Hadad is your brother.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"Ben-Hadad said to him, “Ahab, I will give you back the cities my father took from your father. And you may put shops in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.”"},{"header":"A Prophet Speaks Against Ahab"},{"num":35,"verse":"One prophet from one of the groups of prophets told another, “Hit me!” He said this because the Lord had commanded it, but the other man refused.

Or, you will have to pay a fine of seventy-five pounds of silver.’ "},{"num":40,"verse":"But I was busy doing other things, so the man ran away.”"},{"num":41,"verse":"Then the prophet quickly took the cloth from his face. When the king of Israel saw him, he knew he was one of the prophets.
