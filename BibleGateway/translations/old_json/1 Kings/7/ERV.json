It took 13 years to build Solomon’s palace."},{"num":2,"verse":"He also built the building called the “Forest of Lebanon.” It was 100 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. It had four rows of cedar columns. On top of each column was a cedar capital."},{"num":3,"verse":"There were cedar beams going across the rows of columns.

The room was covered with cedar from floor to ceiling."},{"num":8,"verse":"Behind the Judgment Hall was a courtyard. The palace where Solomon lived was built around that courtyard and looked like the Judgment Hall. He also built the same kind of palace for his wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt."},{"num":9,"verse":"All these buildings were made with expensive blocks of stone. The stones were cut to the right size with a saw and then smoothed on front and back. These expensive stones went from the foundation all the way up to the top layer of the wall. Even the wall around the yard was made with expensive blocks of stone."},{"num":10,"verse":"The foundations were made with large, expensive stones.

His dead father was from Tyre. Huram made things from bronze. He was a very skilled and experienced builder. So King Solomon asked him to come, and Huram accepted. King Solomon put him in charge of all the bronze work, and Huram did all the work he was given to do."},{"num":15,"verse":"Huram made two bronze columns for the porch. Each column was 18 cubits tall and 12 cubits around. The columns were hollow and their metal walls were 3 inches thick."},{"num":16,"verse":"He also made two bronze capitals that were 5 cubits tall.

There were 200 pomegranates in rows all around the capitals."},{"num":21,"verse":"Huram put these two bronze columns at the porch of the Temple. One column was put on the south side of the entrance and one was put on the north side of it. The column on the south was named Jakin.

It was 10 cubits across and 5 cubits deep."},{"num":24,"verse":"There was a rim around the outer edge of the tank. Under this rim there were two rows of bronze gourds all around the tank.

Three were looking north, three east, three south, and three west."},{"num":26,"verse":"The sides of the tank were 3 inches thick.

Each cart was 4 cubits long, 4 cubits wide, and 3 cubits high."},{"num":28,"verse":"The carts were made with square panels set in frames."},{"num":29,"verse":"On the panels and frames were bronze bulls, lions, and Cherub angels. There were designs of flowers hammered into the bronze above and below the bulls and lions."},{"num":30,"verse":"Each cart had four bronze wheels with bronze axles. At the corners there were bronze supports for a large bowl. The supports had designs of flowers hammered into the bronze."},{"num":31,"verse":"There was a frame around the top with an opening for the bowl. The frame was 1 cubit tall, and the opening was 1 1/2 cubits in diameter. There were designs carved into the bronze on the frame. The frame was square, not round."},{"num":32,"verse":"There were four wheels under the frame. The wheels were 1 1/2 cubits in diameter. The axles between the wheels were made as one piece with the cart."},{"num":33,"verse":"The wheels were like the wheels on a chariot.

They were made as one piece with the cart."},{"num":35,"verse":"There was a strip of bronze around the top of each cart. It was made as one piece with the cart."},{"num":36,"verse":"The sides of the cart and the frames had pictures of Cherub angels, lions, and palm trees carved into the bronze. These pictures were carved all over the carts—wherever there was room. And there were flowers carved on the frame around the cart."},{"num":37,"verse":"Huram made ten carts, and they were all the same. Each cart was made from bronze. The bronze was melted and poured into a mold. So all the carts were the same size and shape."},{"num":38,"verse":"Huram also made ten bowls. There was one bowl for each of the ten carts. Each bowl was 4 cubits across and could hold about 230 gallons."},{"num":39,"verse":"He put five carts on the south side of the Temple and five carts on the north side. He put the large tank in the southeast corner of the Temple."},{"num":40,"verse":"Huram also made pots, small shovels, and small bowls. He finished making all the things King Solomon wanted him to make. This is a list of the things that Huram made for the Temple of the Lord:"},{"num":46,"verse":"Solomon never weighed the bronze that was used to make these things. There was too much to weigh. So the total weight of all the bronze was never known. The king ordered these things to be made near the Jordan River between Succoth and Zarethan. They made them by melting the bronze and pouring it into molds in the ground."},{"num":48,"verse":"Solomon also commanded that all these things be made from gold for the Temple:"},{"num":51,"verse":"So King Solomon finished all the work he wanted to do for the Lord’s Temple. Then he took everything his father David had saved for this special purpose and put them in the Temple. He put the silver and gold in the special storage rooms in the Lord’s Temple."}]
