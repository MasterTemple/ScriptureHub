He killed them, shedding their blood during peacetime as if it were a time of war. The blood of battle is upon the belt around his waist and the sandals upon his feet."},{"num":6,"verse":"Deal with him as you think wise, but do not let his gray head go down into Sheol in peace."},{"num":7,"verse":"Show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite. Let them be among those who eat at your table, for they came to me when I fled from Absalom, your brother."},{"num":8,"verse":"“Now, you also have Shimei, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim. He cursed me terribly on the day I traveled to Mahanaim, yet he also came down to meet me at the Jordan. I swore an oath to him by the Lord saying, ‘I will not put you to death by the sword.’"},{"num":9,"verse":"You should not let him go unpunished. You are a wise man; you will know what to do with him.

All of Israel looked to me to reign.

Why not ask for the kingdom for him, for he is my older brother? Ask it for him and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab, the son of Zeruiah.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"Then King Solomon swore an oath by the Lord saying, “May God do this to me and more if Adonijah has not spoken this thing at the cost of his life."},{"num":24,"verse":"Now, therefore, as the Lord lives, who has confirmed me and has set me upon the throne of David, my father, and who has built a house for me as he promised, this very day Adonijah will be put to death.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"So King Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and he fell upon him, so that he died."},{"num":26,"verse":"The king said to Abiathar the priest, “Go to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you really deserve to die now. I will not put you to death, however, because you have carried the Ark of the Lord, the God, before David, my father, and because you suffered whatever my father suffered.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"So Solomon removed Abiathar as priest of the Lord, thus fulfilling the word of the Lord which he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."},{"num":28,"verse":"The news came to Joab (for Joab had followed Adonijah although he had not followed Absalom), and Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord and took hold of the horns on the altar."},{"num":29,"verse":"King Solomon was told, “Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and he is by the altar.” So Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, fall upon him.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Benaiah arrived at the tabernacle of the Lord and said to him, “Thus says the king, ‘Come out.’ ” He answered, “No, I will die here!” Benaiah brought a report back to the king saying, “This is what Joab said; this is how he answered me.”"},{"num":31,"verse":"So the king said to him, “Do what he said, fall upon him and bury him, so that you may remove the innocent blood that Joab shed from me and the house of my father."},{"num":32,"verse":"Thus the Lord will bring the blood back upon his own head. He struck down two men who were more righteous and better than he: Abner, the son of Ner, the commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, the commander of the army of Judah. He slew them with the sword, even though my father did not know about it."},{"num":33,"verse":"Their blood shall come back upon the head of Joab and upon the heads of his descendants forever. But there will be peace forever from the Lord upon David, upon his house, and upon his throne.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up and fell upon him and slew him and buried him in his house in the desert."},{"num":35,"verse":"The king assigned Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, as his replacement to command the army, and the king replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest."},{"num":36,"verse":"The king then sent for and summoned Shimei and he said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem, but do not leave it to go anywhere."},{"num":37,"verse":"On the same day that you cross over the Kidron Brook, know that you will surely die, and your blood will be upon your own head.”"},{"num":38,"verse":"Shimei said to the king, “What you have said is good.
