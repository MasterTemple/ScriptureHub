"},{"num":6,"verse":"Solomon did evil in the Lord’s sight; he did not remain loyal to the Lord, as his father David had. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Furthermore, on the hill east of Jerusalem Solomon built a high place for the detestable Moabite god Chemosh and for the detestable Ammonite god Milcom. "},{"num":8,"verse":"He built high places for all his foreign wives so they could burn incense and make sacrifices to their gods."},{"num":9,"verse":"The Lord was angry with Solomon because he had shifted his allegiance away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him on two occasions "},{"num":10,"verse":"and had warned him about this very thing, so that he would not follow other gods.
