"},{"num":2,"verse":"His servants advised him, “A young virgin must be found for our master, the king, to take care of the king’s needs and serve as his nurse. She can also sleep with you and keep our master, the king, warm.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"So they looked through all Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The young woman was very beautiful; she became the king’s nurse and served him, but the king was not intimate with her."},{"num":5,"verse":"Now Adonijah, son of David and Haggith, was promoting himself, boasting, “I will be king!” He managed to acquire chariots and horsemen, as well as fifty men to serve as his royal guard. "},{"num":6,"verse":"(Now his father had never corrected him by saying, “Why do you do such things?” He was also very handsome and had been born right after Absalom.) "},{"num":7,"verse":"He collaborated with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they supported him. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s elite warriors did not ally themselves with Adonijah. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Adonijah sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened steers at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, as well as all the men of Judah, the king’s servants.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"Visit King David and say to him, ‘My master, O king, did you not solemnly promise your servant, “Surely your son Solomon will be king after me; he will sit on my throne”? So why has Adonijah become king?’ "},{"num":14,"verse":"While you are still there speaking to the king, I will arrive and verify your report.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"So Bathsheba visited the king in his private quarters. (The king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.) "},{"num":16,"verse":"Bathsheba bowed down on the floor before the king. The king said, “What do you want?” "},{"num":17,"verse":"She replied to him, “My master, you swore an oath to your servant by the Lord your God, ‘Solomon your son will be king after me and he will sit on my throne.’ "},{"num":18,"verse":"But now, look, Adonijah has become king!

When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he asked, “Why is there such a noisy commotion in the city?” "},{"num":42,"verse":"As he was still speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in, for an important man like you must be bringing good news.” "},{"num":43,"verse":"Jonathan replied to Adonijah: “No! Our master King David has made Solomon king.
