"},{"num":5,"verse":"At Giv‘on Adonai appeared to Shlomo in a dream at night; God said, “Tell me what I should give you.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"Shlomo said, “You showed your servant David my father much grace, as he lived before you honestly and righteously, having an upright heart with you. You preserved this great grace for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as is the case today.

"},{"num":11,"verse":"God said to him, “Because you have made this request instead of asking long life or riches for yourself, or your enemies’ death, but rather asked for yourself understanding to discern justice; "},{"num":12,"verse":"I am doing what you requested. I am giving you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has never been anyone like you, nor will there ever again be anyone like you.
