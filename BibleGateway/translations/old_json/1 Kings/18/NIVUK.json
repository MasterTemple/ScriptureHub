(Obadiah was a devout believer in the Lord. "},{"num":4,"verse":"While Jezebel was killing off the Lord’s prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.) "},{"num":5,"verse":"Ahab had said to Obadiah, ‘Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.’ "},{"num":6,"verse":"So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another."},{"num":7,"verse":"As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognised him, bowed down to the ground, and said, ‘Is it really you, my lord Elijah?’"},{"num":8,"verse":"‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘Go tell your master, “Elijah is here.”’"},{"num":9,"verse":"‘What have I done wrong,’ asked Obadiah, ‘that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? "},{"num":10,"verse":"As surely as the Lord your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"When he saw Elijah, he said to him, ‘Is that you, you troubler of Israel?’"},{"num":18,"verse":"‘I have not made trouble for Israel,’ Elijah replied. ‘But you and your father’s family have. You have abandoned the Lord’s commands and have followed the Baals. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.’"},{"num":20,"verse":"So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. "},{"num":21,"verse":"Elijah went before the people and said, ‘How long will you waver between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.’"},{"num":22,"verse":"Then Elijah said to them, ‘I am the only one of the Lord’s prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. "},{"num":23,"verse":"Get two bulls for us. Let Baal’s prophets choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord. The god who answers by fire – he is God.’"},{"num":25,"verse":"Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, ‘Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.’ "},{"num":26,"verse":"So they took the bull that was given to them and prepared it."},{"num":27,"verse":"At noon Elijah began to taunt them. ‘Shout louder!’ he said. ‘Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or travelling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.’ "},{"num":28,"verse":"So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. "},{"num":29,"verse":"Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention."},{"num":30,"verse":"Then Elijah said to all the people, ‘Come here to me.’ They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the Lord, which had been torn down. "},{"num":31,"verse":"Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, ‘Your name shall be Israel.’ "},{"num":32,"verse":"With the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord, and he dug a trench round it large enough to hold two seahs of seed.

Then he said to them, ‘Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.’"},{"num":34,"verse":"‘Do it again,’ he said, and they did it again."},{"num":35,"verse":"The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench."},{"num":36,"verse":"At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: ‘Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.

The Lord – he is God!’"},{"num":40,"verse":"Then Elijah commanded them, ‘Seize the prophets of Baal. Don’t let anyone get away!’ They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there."},{"num":41,"verse":"And Elijah said to Ahab, ‘Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.’ "},{"num":42,"verse":"So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees."},{"num":43,"verse":"‘Go and look toward the sea,’ he told his servant.
