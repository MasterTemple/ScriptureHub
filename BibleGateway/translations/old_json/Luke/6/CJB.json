[{"num":6,"verse":"One Shabbat, while Yeshua was passing through some wheat fields, his talmidim began plucking the heads of grain, rubbing them between their hands and eating the seeds. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Some of the P’rushim said, “Why are you violating Shabbat?” "},{"num":3,"verse":"Yeshua answered them, “Haven’t you ever read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? "},{"num":4,"verse":"He entered the House of God and took and ate the Bread of the Presence” — which no one is permitted to eat but the cohanim. "},{"num":5,"verse":"“The Son of Man,” he concluded, “is Lord of Shabbat.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"On another Shabbat, when Yeshua had gone into the synagogue and was teaching, a man was there who had a shriveled hand. "},{"num":7,"verse":"The Torah-teachers and P’rushim watched Yeshua carefully to see if he would heal on Shabbat, so that they could accuse him of something. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But he knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Come up and stand where we can see you!” He got up and stood there. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Yeshua said to them, “I ask you now: what is permitted on Shabbat? Doing good or doing evil? Saving life or destroying it?” "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then, after looking around at all of them, he said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” As he held it out, his hand was restored. "},{"num":11,"verse":"But the others were filled with fury and began discussing with each other what they could do to Yeshua."},{"num":12,"verse":"It was around that time that Yeshua went out to the hill country to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God. "},{"num":13,"verse":"When day came, he called his talmidim and chose from among them twelve to be known as emissaries:"},{"num":14,"verse":"Shim‘on, whom he named Kefa; Andrew, his brother; Ya‘akov; Yochanan; Philip; Bar-Talmai;"},{"num":15,"verse":"Mattityahu; T’oma; Ya‘akov Ben-Halfai;"},{"num":16,"verse":"Shim‘on, the one called the Zealot; Y’hudah Ben-Ya‘akov; and Y’hudah from K’riot, who turned traitor."},{"num":17,"verse":"Then he came down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his talmidim was there with great numbers of people from all Y’hudah, Yerushalayim and the coast around Tzor and Tzidon; they had come to hear him and be healed of their diseases.

Your reward will be great, and you will be children of Ha‘Elyon; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.

Won’t they both fall into a pit? "},{"num":40,"verse":"A talmid is not above his rabbi; but each one, when he is fully trained, will be like his rabbi. "},{"num":41,"verse":"So why do you see the splinter in your brother’s eye, but not notice the log in your own eye? "},{"num":42,"verse":"How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the splinter from your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye; then you will see clearly, so that you can remove the splinter from your brother’s eye!"},{"num":43,"verse":"“For no good tree produces bad fruit, nor does a bad tree produce good fruit.

"},{"num":45,"verse":"The good person produces good things from the store of good in his heart, while the evil person produces evil things from the store of evil in his heart. For his mouth speaks what overflows from his heart."},{"num":46,"verse":"“Why do you call me, ‘Lord! Lord!’ but not do what I say?
