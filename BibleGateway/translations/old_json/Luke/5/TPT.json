"},{"num":2,"verse":"He noticed two fishing boats at the water’s edge, with the fishermen nearby, rinsing their nets. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Jesus climbed into the boat belonging to Simon Peter and said to him, “Let me use your boat. Push it off a short distance away from the shore so I can speak to the crowd.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Jesus sat down and taught the people from the boat. When he had finished, he said to Peter, “Now row out to deep water to cast your nets and you will have a great catch.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"“Master,” Peter replied, “we’ve just come back from fishing all night and didn’t catch a thing. But if you insist, we’ll go out again and let down our nets because of your word.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"When they pulled up their nets, they were shocked to see a huge catch of fish, and their nets were ready to burst! "},{"num":7,"verse":"They waved to their business partners in the other boat for help.

Massive crowds continually gathered to hear him speak and to be healed from their illnesses. "},{"num":16,"verse":"But Jesus often slipped away from them and went into the wilderness to pray."},{"num":17,"verse":"One day, many Jewish religious leaders known as Pharisees, along with many religious scholars, came from every village in Galilee, throughout Judea, and even from Jerusalem to hear Jesus teach. And the power of the Lord God surged through him to instantly heal the sick."},{"num":18,"verse":"Some men came to Jesus, carrying a paraplegic man on a stretcher. They attempted to bring him in past the crowd to set him down in front of Jesus. "},{"num":19,"verse":"But because there were so many people crowding the door, they had no way to bring him inside. So they crawled onto the roof, dug their way through the roof tiles, and lowered the man, stretcher and all, into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus."},{"num":20,"verse":"Seeing the demonstration of their faith, Jesus said to the paraplegic man, “My friend, your sins are forgiven!”"},{"num":21,"verse":"The Jewish religious leaders and the religious scholars whispered objections among themselves. “Who does this man think he is to speak such blasphemy? Only God can forgive sins! Does he think he is God?”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Why do you argue in your hearts over what I do and think that it is blasphemy for me to say his sins are forgiven?

So he invited Jesus to his home for dinner, along with many of Levi’s fellow tax collectors and other guests.
