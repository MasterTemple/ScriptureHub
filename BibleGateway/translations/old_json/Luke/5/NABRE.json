"},{"num":3,"verse":"Getting into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, he asked him to put out a short distance from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. "},{"num":4,"verse":"After he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"Simon said in reply, “Master, we have worked hard all night and have caught nothing, but at your command I will lower the nets.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish and their nets were tearing. "},{"num":7,"verse":"They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come to help them. They came and filled both boats so that they were in danger of sinking. "},{"num":8,"verse":"When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at the knees of Jesus and said, “Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"For astonishment at the catch of fish they had made seized him and all those with him, "},{"num":10,"verse":"and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners of Simon.

"},{"num":19,"verse":"But not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on the stretcher through the tiles into the middle in front of Jesus. "},{"num":20,"verse":"When he saw their faith, he said, “As for you, your sins are forgiven.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Then the scribes and Pharisees began to ask themselves, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who but God alone can forgive sins?” "},{"num":22,"verse":"Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them in reply, “What are you thinking in your hearts?
