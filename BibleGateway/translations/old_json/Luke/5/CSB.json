But if you say so, I’ll let down the nets.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"When they did this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets began to tear. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink."},{"num":8,"verse":"When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’s knees and said, “Go away from me, because I’m a sinful man, Lord!”  "},{"num":9,"verse":"For he and all those with him were amazed at the catch of fish they had taken, "},{"num":10,"verse":"and so were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s partners."},{"num":11,"verse":"Then they brought the boats to land, left everything, and followed him."},{"header":"A Man Cleansed"},{"num":12,"verse":"While he was in one of the towns, a man was there who had leprosy all over him.
