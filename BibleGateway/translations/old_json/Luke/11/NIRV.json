I can’t get up and give you anything.’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"I tell you, that person will not get up. And he won’t give you bread just because he is your friend. But because you keep bothering him, he will surely get up. He will give you as much as you need."},{"num":9,"verse":"“So here is what I say to you. Ask, and it will be given to you. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Everyone who asks will receive. The one who searches will find. And the door will be opened to the one who knocks."},{"num":11,"verse":"“Fathers, suppose your son asks for a fish. Which of you will give him a snake instead?
