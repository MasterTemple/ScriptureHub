He was a leading tax collector, and a rich one at that! "},{"num":3,"verse":"He was trying to see who Jesus was, but he couldn’t do so due to the crowd, since he was a short man. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who was going to pass that way."},{"num":5,"verse":"When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down! I must stay at your house today.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"Zacchaeus came down quickly and was glad to welcome him into his home."},{"num":7,"verse":"But all the people who saw this began to complain: “Jesus is going to be the guest of a notorious sinner!”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Later, Zacchaeus stood up and announced to the Lord, “Look! I’m giving half of my possessions to the destitute, and if I have accused anyone falsely, I’m repaying four times as much as I owe.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Jesus told him, “Today salvation has come to this home, because this man is also a descendant of Abraham, "},{"num":10,"verse":"and the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.”"},{"header":"The Parable about the Coins"},{"num":11,"verse":"As they were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem and because the people thought that the kingdom of God would appear immediately. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So he said, “A prince went to a distant country to be appointed king and then to return. "},{"num":13,"verse":"He called ten of his servants and gave them ten coins. He told them, ‘Invest this money until I come back.’ "},{"num":14,"verse":"But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation to follow him and to announce, ‘We don’t want this man to rule over us!’"},{"num":15,"verse":"“After he was appointed king, the prince came back. He ordered the servants to whom he had given the money to be called so he could find out what they had earned by investing. "},{"num":16,"verse":"The first servant came and said, ‘Sir, your coin has earned ten more coins.’ "},{"num":17,"verse":"The king told him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing, take charge of ten cities.’"},{"num":18,"verse":"“The second servant came and said, ‘Your coin, sir, has earned five coins.’ "},{"num":19,"verse":"The king told him, ‘You take charge of five cities.’"},{"num":20,"verse":"“Then the other servant came and said, ‘Sir, look! Here’s your coin. I’ve kept it in a cloth for safekeeping "},{"num":21,"verse":"because I was afraid of you. You are a hard man. You withdraw what you didn’t deposit and harvest what you didn’t plant.’ "},{"num":22,"verse":"The king told him, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you evil servant! You knew, did you, that I was a hard man, and that I withdraw what I didn’t deposit and harvest what I didn’t plant? "},{"num":23,"verse":"Then why didn’t you put my money in the bank? When I returned, I could have collected it with interest.’"},{"num":24,"verse":"“So the king told those standing nearby, ‘Take the coin away from him and give it to the man who has the ten coins.’ "},{"num":25,"verse":"They answered him, ‘Sir, he already has ten coins!’ "},{"num":26,"verse":"‘I tell you, to everyone who has something, more will be given, but from the person who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.

"},{"num":29,"verse":"As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples on ahead. "},{"num":30,"verse":"“Go into the village ahead of you,” he said. “As you enter, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it along. "},{"num":31,"verse":"If anyone asks you why you are untying it, say this: ‘The Lord needs it.’”"},{"num":32,"verse":"So those who were sent went off and found it as Jesus had told them. "},{"num":33,"verse":"While they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?”"},{"num":34,"verse":"The disciples answered, “The Lord needs it.” "},{"num":35,"verse":"Then they brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it, and Jesus sat upon it."},{"num":36,"verse":"As he was riding along, people kept spreading their coats on the road. "},{"num":37,"verse":"He was now approaching the descent from the Mount of Olives. The whole crowd of disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice because of all the miracles they had seen. "},{"num":38,"verse":"They said,"},{"num":39,"verse":"Some of the Pharisees in the crowd told Jesus, “Teacher, tell your disciples to be quiet.”"},{"num":40,"verse":"He replied, “I tell you, if they were quiet, the stones would cry out!”"},{"num":41,"verse":"When he came closer and saw the city, he began to grieve over it: "},{"num":42,"verse":"“If you had only known today what could have brought you peace! But now it is hidden from your sight, "},{"num":43,"verse":"because the days will come when your enemies will build walls around you, surround you, and close you in on every side.

The high priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him, "},{"num":48,"verse":"but they couldn’t find a way to do it, because all the people were eager to hear him."}]
