[{"header":"Chapter 19"},{"num":1,"verse":"Zacchaeus the Tax Collector. He came to Jericho and intended to pass through the town. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Now a man there named Zacchaeus, who was a chief tax collector and also a wealthy man, "},{"num":3,"verse":"was seeking to see who Jesus was; but he could not see him because of the crowd, for he was short in stature. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see Jesus, who was about to pass that way. "},{"num":5,"verse":"When he reached the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for today I must stay at your house.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"And he came down quickly and received him with joy. "},{"num":7,"verse":"When they all saw this, they began to grumble, saying, “He has gone to stay at the house of a sinner.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, “Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I shall give to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house because this man too is a descendant of Abraham. "},{"num":10,"verse":"For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"While they were listening to him speak, he proceeded to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God would appear there immediately. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So he said, “A nobleman went off to a distant country to obtain the kingship for himself and then to return. "},{"num":13,"verse":"He called ten of his servants and gave them ten gold coins and told them, ‘Engage in trade with these until I return.’ "},{"num":14,"verse":"His fellow citizens, however, despised him and sent a delegation after him to announce, ‘We do not want this man to be our king.’ "},{"num":15,"verse":"But when he returned after obtaining the kingship, he had the servants called, to whom he had given the money, to learn what they had gained by trading. "},{"num":16,"verse":"The first came forward and said, ‘Sir, your gold coin has earned ten additional ones.’ "},{"num":17,"verse":"He replied, ‘Well done, good servant! You have been faithful in this very small matter; take charge of ten cities.’ "},{"num":18,"verse":"Then the second came and reported, ‘Your gold coin, sir, has earned five more.’ "},{"num":19,"verse":"And to this servant too he said, ‘You, take charge of five cities.’ "},{"num":20,"verse":"Then the other servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your gold coin; I kept it stored away in a handkerchief, "},{"num":21,"verse":"for I was afraid of you, because you are a demanding person; you take up what you did not lay down and you harvest what you did not plant.’ "},{"num":22,"verse":"He said to him, ‘With your own words I shall condemn you, you wicked servant. You knew I was a demanding person, taking up what I did not lay down and harvesting what I did not plant; "},{"num":23,"verse":"why did you not put my money in a bank? Then on my return I would have collected it with interest.’ "},{"num":24,"verse":"And to those standing by he said, ‘Take the gold coin from him and give it to the servant who has ten.’ "},{"num":25,"verse":"But they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten gold coins.’ "},{"num":26,"verse":"‘I tell you, to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Now as for those enemies of mine who did not want me as their king, bring them here and slay them before me.’”"},{"num":28,"verse":"After he had said this, he proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem. "},{"num":29,"verse":"As he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples. "},{"num":30,"verse":"He said, “Go into the village opposite you, and as you enter it you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. "},{"num":31,"verse":"And if anyone should ask you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you will answer, ‘The Master has need of it.’” "},{"num":32,"verse":"So those who had been sent went off and found everything just as he had told them. "},{"num":33,"verse":"And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying this colt?” "},{"num":34,"verse":"They answered, “The Master has need of it.” "},{"num":35,"verse":"So they brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks over the colt, and helped Jesus to mount. "},{"num":36,"verse":"As he rode along, the people were spreading their cloaks on the road; "},{"num":37,"verse":"and now as he was approaching the slope of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of his disciples began to praise God aloud with joy for all the mighty deeds they had seen. "},{"num":38,"verse":"They proclaimed:"},{"num":39,"verse":"Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.” "},{"num":40,"verse":"He said in reply, “I tell you, if they keep silent, the stones will cry out!”"},{"num":41,"verse":"As he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it, "},{"num":42,"verse":"saying, “If this day you only knew what makes for peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes. "},{"num":43,"verse":"For the days are coming upon you when your enemies will raise a palisade against you; they will encircle you and hem you in on all sides. "},{"num":44,"verse":"They will smash you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another within you because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.”"},{"num":45,"verse":"The Cleansing of the Temple. Then Jesus entered the temple area and proceeded to drive out those who were selling things, "},{"num":46,"verse":"saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.’” "},{"num":47,"verse":"And every day he was teaching in the temple area. The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people, meanwhile, were seeking to put him to death, "},{"num":48,"verse":"but they could find no way to accomplish their purpose because all the people were hanging on his words."}]
