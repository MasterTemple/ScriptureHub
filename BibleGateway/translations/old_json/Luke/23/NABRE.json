[{"header":"Chapter 23"},{"num":1,"verse":"Jesus Before Pilate. Then the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate. "},{"num":2,"verse":"They brought charges against him, saying, “We found this man misleading our people; he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar and maintains that he is the Messiah, a king.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” He said to him in reply, “You say so.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Pilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds, “I find this man not guilty.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"But they were adamant and said, “He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to here.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Jesus Before Herod. On hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean; "},{"num":7,"verse":"and upon learning that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Herod was very glad to see Jesus; he had been wanting to see him for a long time, for he had heard about him and had been hoping to see him perform some sign. "},{"num":9,"verse":"He questioned him at length, but he gave him no answer. "},{"num":10,"verse":"The chief priests and scribes, meanwhile, stood by accusing him harshly. "},{"num":11,"verse":"[Even] Herod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him, and after clothing him in resplendent garb, he sent him back to Pilate. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, even though they had been enemies formerly. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people "},{"num":14,"verse":"and said to them, “You brought this man to me and accused him of inciting the people to revolt. I have conducted my investigation in your presence and have not found this man guilty of the charges you have brought against him, "},{"num":15,"verse":"nor did Herod, for he sent him back to us. So no capital crime has been committed by him. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"[]"},{"num":18,"verse":"But all together they shouted out, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us.” "},{"num":19,"verse":"(Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion that had taken place in the city and for murder.) "},{"num":20,"verse":"Again Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus, "},{"num":21,"verse":"but they continued their shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” "},{"num":22,"verse":"Pilate addressed them a third time, “What evil has this man done? I found him guilty of no capital crime. Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.” "},{"num":23,"verse":"With loud shouts, however, they persisted in calling for his crucifixion, and their voices prevailed. "},{"num":24,"verse":"The verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted. "},{"num":25,"verse":"So he released the man who had been imprisoned for rebellion and murder, for whom they asked, and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished."},{"num":26,"verse":"As they led him away they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country; and after laying the cross on him, they made him carry it behind Jesus. "},{"num":27,"verse":"A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him. "},{"num":28,"verse":"Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children, "},{"num":29,"verse":"for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.’ "},{"num":30,"verse":"At that time people will say to the mountains, ‘Fall upon us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’ "},{"num":31,"verse":"for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?” "},{"num":32,"verse":"Now two others, both criminals, were led away with him to be executed."},{"num":33,"verse":"When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left. "},{"num":34,"verse":"[Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.”] They divided his garments by casting lots. "},{"num":35,"verse":"The people stood by and watched; the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said, “He saved others, let him save himself if he is the chosen one, the Messiah of God.” "},{"num":36,"verse":"Even the soldiers jeered at him. As they approached to offer him wine "},{"num":37,"verse":"they called out, “If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.” "},{"num":38,"verse":"Above him there was an inscription that read, “This is the King of the Jews.”"},{"num":39,"verse":"Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, “Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.” "},{"num":40,"verse":"The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply, “Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation? "},{"num":41,"verse":"And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.” "},{"num":42,"verse":"Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” "},{"num":43,"verse":"He replied to him, “Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”"},{"num":44,"verse":"It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon "},{"num":45,"verse":"because of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit”; and when he had said this he breathed his last. "},{"num":47,"verse":"The centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said, “This man was innocent beyond doubt.” "},{"num":48,"verse":"When all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts; "},{"num":49,"verse":"but all his acquaintances stood at a distance, including the women who had followed him from Galilee and saw these events."},{"num":50,"verse":"Now there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who, though he was a member of the council, "},{"num":51,"verse":"had not consented to their plan of action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea and was awaiting the kingdom of God. "},{"num":52,"verse":"He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. "},{"num":53,"verse":"After he had taken the body down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb in which no one had yet been buried. "},{"num":54,"verse":"It was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was about to begin. "},{"num":55,"verse":"The women who had come from Galilee with him followed behind, and when they had seen the tomb and the way in which his body was laid in it, "},{"num":56,"verse":"they returned and prepared spices and perfumed oils. Then they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment."}]
