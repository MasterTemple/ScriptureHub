"},{"num":3,"verse":"No, I tell you. Rather, unless you turn to God from your sins, you will all die as they did!"},{"num":4,"verse":"“Or what about those eighteen people who died when the tower at Shiloach fell on them? Do you think they were worse offenders than all the other people living in Yerushalayim? "},{"num":5,"verse":"No, I tell you.
