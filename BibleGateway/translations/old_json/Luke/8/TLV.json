Then they stopped, and it became calm."},{"num":25,"verse":"Then Yeshua said to them, “Where is your faith?” But they were afraid and marveled, saying to one another, “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!”"},{"header":"Not Welcome in the Gerasenes"},{"num":26,"verse":"They sailed over to the country of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite side of the Galilee.

The man hadn’t worn any clothing for a long time and was living not in a house but in the tombs."},{"num":28,"verse":"Seeing Yeshua, he cried out and fell down before Yeshua, and with a loud voice said, “What’s between You and me, Yeshua, Ben El Elyon? I’m begging You, do not torment me!” "},{"num":29,"verse":"For Yeshua commanded the defiling spirit to come out of the man.

So He got into a boat and returned."},{"num":38,"verse":"The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with Yeshua. But Yeshua sent him away, saying, "},{"num":39,"verse":"“Return to your home, and describe all that God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town all that Yeshua had done for him."},{"header":"Interrupted on the Way to a Miracle"},{"num":40,"verse":"As Yeshua returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all expecting Him.
