"},{"num":2,"verse":"The chief priests and the experts in the law were trying to find some way to execute Jesus, for they were afraid of the people."},{"num":3,"verse":"Then Satan entered Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was one of the twelve. "},{"num":4,"verse":"He went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers of the temple guard how he might betray Jesus, handing him over to them. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They were delighted and arranged to give him money. "},{"num":6,"verse":"So Judas agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus when no crowd was present."},{"header":"The Passover"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then the day for the feast of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us to eat.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?” "},{"num":10,"verse":"He said to them, “Listen, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters, "},{"num":11,"verse":"and tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ "},{"num":12,"verse":"Then he will show you a large furnished room upstairs.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"So Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ "},{"num":26,"verse":"Not so with you; instead the one who is greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the one who serves.

"},{"num":51,"verse":"But Jesus said, “Enough of this!” And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. "},{"num":52,"verse":"Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders who had come out to get him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs like you would against an outlaw?
