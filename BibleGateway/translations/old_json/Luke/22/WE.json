Judas was one of the twelve disciples. His other name was Iscariot."},{"num":4,"verse":"Judas went away and talked things over with the chief priests and captains. He told them how he could help them catch Jesus."},{"num":5,"verse":"They were glad, and they said they would give him money for it."},{"num":6,"verse":"He agreed. He watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus when there were not too many people around."},{"num":7,"verse":"It was the day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast,"},{"num":8,"verse":"So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying to them, `Go and get the Passover Feast ready for us to eat.'"},{"num":9,"verse":"They asked, `Where do you want us to get it ready?'"},{"num":10,"verse":"He said, `When you go into the city, a man carrying a pot of water will meet you. Follow him into the house where he goes."},{"num":11,"verse":"Tell the master of the house, \"The Teacher says, `Where is the room where I can eat the Passover Feast with my disciples?' \""},{"num":12,"verse":"He will show you a large room upstairs.

He wants to shake you like grain with the cleaning fan."},{"num":32,"verse":"But I have talked to God about you, Simon, so that you will keep on believing in me. And when you come back, then help your brothers to be strong.'"},{"num":33,"verse":"Simon said, `Lord, I will go with you, even to prison or to die.'"},{"num":34,"verse":"Jesus said, `I tell you this, Peter. This very day, before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.'"},{"num":35,"verse":"Jesus said to them, `When I sent you out to the towns, I told you not to carry a money bag, or a bag, or shoes. Did you ever need anything at that time?' They said, `No.'"},{"num":36,"verse":"He said, `But this time, anyone who has money should take it and his bag too. Anyone who has no sword should sell his coat and buy one."},{"num":37,"verse":"`The holy writings say, \"He was counted as one of the bad people.\" And I tell you, that means me. And the things that are written about me must happen to me.'"},{"num":38,"verse":"The disciples said, `Look, Lord, here are two swords.'

His disciples went with him."},{"num":40,"verse":"He said to them, `Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.'"},{"num":41,"verse":"He went away from them about as far as a person can throw a stone. Then he kneeled down to talk with God."},{"num":42,"verse":"He said, `Father, if you will, take this cup away from me. But do not do what I want but what you want.'"},{"num":43,"verse":"Then an angel came to him from heaven and helped to make him strong."},{"num":44,"verse":"His heart was troubled very much. So he talked with God more than before. His sweat was like big drops of blood falling on the ground."},{"num":45,"verse":"He stopped talking with God and got up. He went to his disciples and found them sleeping because they were sad."},{"num":46,"verse":"He said to them, `Why are you sleeping? Get up. Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.'"},{"num":47,"verse":"As Jesus was saying this, many men came. One of the twelve disciples, named Judas, was leading the people. He came near Jesus to kiss him."},{"num":48,"verse":"Jesus said to him, `Judas, will you give over the Son of Man to his enemies with a kiss?'"},{"num":49,"verse":"The disciples around Jesus saw what was going to happen. They said, `Lord, shall we fight with our swords?'"},{"num":50,"verse":"One of them hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear."},{"num":51,"verse":"Jesus said, `Just let me do this.' And he touched the man's ear and healed him."},{"num":52,"verse":"The chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the leaders of the people had come to catch Jesus. He said to them, `Have you come to take me with swords and sticks, the way you catch a man who steals?"},{"num":53,"verse":"I was with you every day in the temple. You did not try to catch me then. But this is your time now, the time of the power of darkness.'"},{"num":54,"verse":"The men caught Jesus and took him away to the high priest's house. Peter followed them far behind."},{"num":55,"verse":"They made a fire in the yard and sat around it. Peter sat down with them."},{"num":56,"verse":"A woman saw Peter sitting by the fire.

But Peter said, `Man, I am not.'"},{"num":59,"verse":"About an hour later another person said, `Surely this man was with him. He comes from Galilee.'"},{"num":60,"verse":"Peter said, `Man, I do not know what you are talking about.' And right then, while he was talking, the cock called."},{"num":61,"verse":"The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered that the Lord had said to him, `Before the cock calls in the morning, you will say three times that you do not know me.'"},{"num":62,"verse":"Peter went out and cried very much."},{"num":63,"verse":"The men who guarded Jesus made fun of him and beat him."},{"num":64,"verse":"They tied something over his eyes.

They took Jesus to their court."},{"num":67,"verse":"They said, `If you are the Christ, tell us.' Jesus said, `If I tell you, you will not believe."},{"num":68,"verse":"And if I ask you anything, you will not answer."},{"num":69,"verse":"From this time on the Son of Man will sit beside God who has all power.'"},{"num":70,"verse":"They all said, `Then are you the Son of God?\" He said, `Yes, I am.'"},{"num":71,"verse":"They said, `We do not need any more proof against him. We ourselves have heard what he said.'"}]
