[{"header":"Jesus Warns against Hypocrisy"},{"num":12,"verse":"By now a crowd of many thousands had gathered around Jesus. So many people pushed to be near him, they began to trample one another."},{"num":2,"verse":"Everything hidden and covered up will soon be exposed. For the facade is falling down, and nothing will be kept secret for long. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Whatever you have spoken in private will be public knowledge, and what you have whispered secretly behind closed doors will be broadcast far and wide for all to hear."},{"num":4,"verse":"“Listen, my beloved friends, don’t fear those who may want to take your life but can do nothing more. It’s true that they may kill your body, but they have no power over your soul. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The one you must fear is God, for he has both the power to take your life and the authority to cast your soul into hell. Yes, the only one you need to fear is God."},{"num":6,"verse":"“What is the value of your soul to God? Could your worth be defined by any amount of money? God doesn’t abandon or forget even the small sparrow he has made. How then could he forget or abandon you? What about the seemingly minor issues of your life? Do they matter to God? Of course they do! So you never need to worry, for you are more valuable to God than anything else in this world."},{"num":8,"verse":"“I can assure you of this: If you freely declare in public that I am the Son of Man, the Messiah, then I will freely declare to all the angels of God that you are mine. "},{"num":9,"verse":"But if you publicly pretend that you don’t know me, I will deny you before the angels of God. "},{"num":10,"verse":"If anyone speaks evil of me, the Son of Man, that one can be forgiven. But if anyone speaks scornfully against the Holy Spirit, it will never be forgiven. "},{"num":11,"verse":"And remember this: When people publicly accuse you and forcefully drag you before the religious leaders and authorities, do not be troubled. Don’t worry about defending yourself or how to answer their accusations. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Simply be confident and allow the Spirit of Wisdom access to your heart, and in that very moment he will reveal what you are to say to them.”"},{"header":"Jesus Condemns Greed"},{"num":13,"verse":"Just then someone spoke up from the crowd and said, “Master, you should compel my older brother to divide the family inheritance and give me my fair share!”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Jesus answered, “My friend, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?”"},{"num":15,"verse":"Speaking to the people, Jesus continued, “Be alert and guard your heart from greed and from always wishing for what you don’t have. For your life can never be measured by the amount of things you possess.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"Jesus then gave them this illustration: “A wealthy land owner had a farm that produced bumper crops. Every year the harvest was so great it filled his barns to overflowing! "},{"num":17,"verse":"He thought, ‘What should I do now that every barn is full and I have nowhere else to store more? "},{"num":18,"verse":"I know what I’ll do! I’ll tear down the barns and build one massive barn to hold all my grain and goods. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Then I can just sit back, surrounded with comfort and ease. I’ll enjoy life with no worries at all.’"},{"num":20,"verse":"“God said to him, ‘What a fool you are to trust in your riches and not in me! This very night the messengers of death will demand to take your life. Then who will get all the wealth you have stored up for yourself?’ "},{"num":21,"verse":"The same thing will happen to all those who fill up their lives with everything but God.”"},{"header":"Don’t Worry"},{"num":22,"verse":"Jesus taught his disciples, saying, “Listen to me. Never let anxiety enter your hearts. Never worry about any of your needs, such as food or clothing. "},{"num":23,"verse":"For your life is infinitely more than just the food you eat or the clothing you wear. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Take the carefree birds as your example. Do you ever see them worry? They neither grow their own food nor put it in a storehouse for later. Yet God takes care of every one of them, feeding each of them out of the abundance of his love and goodness. Isn’t your life more precious to God than a bird? Be carefree in the care of God!"},{"num":25,"verse":"“Does worry add anything to your life? Can it add one more year, or even one day? "},{"num":26,"verse":"So if worrying adds nothing, but actually subtracts from your life, why would you worry about God’s care of you?"},{"num":27,"verse":"“Think about the lilies. They grow and become beautiful, not because they work hard or strive to clothe themselves. Yet not even Solomon, wearing his kingly garments of splendor, could be compared to a field of lilies. "},{"num":28,"verse":"If God can clothe the fields and meadows with grass and flowers, can he not clothe you as well, O struggling one with so many doubts? "},{"num":29,"verse":"I repeat: Don’t let worry enter your life. Live above the anxious cares about your personal needs. "},{"num":30,"verse":"People everywhere seem to worry about making a living, but your heavenly Father knows your every need and will take care of you. "},{"num":31,"verse":"As you passionately seek his kingdom, above all else, he will supply your needs. "},{"num":32,"verse":"So don’t ever be afraid, dearest friends! Your loving Father joyously gives you his kingdom with all its promises!"},{"num":33,"verse":"“Now, go and sell what you have and give to those in need; you will be making deposits in your account in heaven, an account that will never be taken from you. Your gifts will become a secure and unfailing treasure, deposited in heaven forever. "},{"num":34,"verse":"Where you deposit your treasure, that is where you fix your thoughts—and your heart will long to be there also.”"},{"header":"Be Ready"},{"num":35,"verse":"“Be prepared for action at a moment’s notice. "},{"num":36,"verse":"Be like servants anticipating their master’s return from a wedding celebration. They are ready at a moment’s notice to unlock and open the door for him. "},{"num":37,"verse":"What great joy is ahead for those who stay awake and wait for their Master’s return! He himself will become their servant and wait on them. "},{"num":38,"verse":"He may appear at midnight or even later, but what great joy for the awakened ones whenever he comes! "},{"num":39,"verse":"Of course, if they knew ahead of time the hour of their master’s appearing, they would be alert, just as they would be ready if they knew ahead of time that a thief was coming to break into their house. "},{"num":40,"verse":"So keep being alert and ready at all times. For I promise you that the Son of Man will surprise you and appear when you don’t expect him.”"},{"header":"The Faithful Servant"},{"num":41,"verse":"“Lord,” Peter asked, “does this apply only to the twelve of us, or is it for everyone else as well?”"},{"num":42,"verse":"The Lord replied, “A master will delegate authority in his house to a trustworthy and thoughtful manager who understands his master’s desires. And the household manager will serve others what they need at exactly the right time. "},{"num":43,"verse":"And whenever his master returns, he will find that his servant has served him well. I promise you, the master will reward him generously and he will be placed as an overseer of everything he owns."},{"num":45,"verse":"“But what if that servant says in his heart, ‘My master delays his coming, and who knows when he will return?’ Because of the delay, the servant elevates himself and mistreats those in his master’s household. Instead of caring for the ones he was appointed to serve, he abuses the other servants, both men and women. He throws drunken parties for his friends and gives himself over to every pleasure. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Let me tell you what will happen to him. His master will suddenly return at a time that shocks him, and he will remove the abusive, selfish servant from his position of trust. The master will punish him and assign him a portion with the unbelievers."},{"num":47,"verse":"“Every servant who knows what pleases his master yet does not make himself ready and refuses to put his master’s will to action will receive many punishing blows. "},{"num":48,"verse":"Every servant who does not know his master’s will and unwittingly does what is wrong will receive a less severe punishment. For those who have received a greater revelation from their master are required a greater obedience. And those who have been entrusted with great responsibility will be held more responsible to their master.”"},{"header":"Jesus Brings Fire to the Earth"},{"num":49,"verse":"“I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already ablaze with fiery passion for God! "},{"num":50,"verse":"But first I must be immersed into the baptism of God’s judgment, and I am consumed with passion as I await its fulfillment. "},{"num":51,"verse":"Don’t think for a moment that I came to grant peace and harmony to everyone. No, my arrival will change everything and create hostility among you. "},{"num":52,"verse":"From now on, even family members will be divided over me and will choose sides one against another. "},{"num":53,"verse":"Fathers will be divided from sons and sons from fathers; mothers will be divided from daughters and daughters from mothers; mothers-in-law will be against brides and brides against mothers-in-law—all because of me.”"},{"header":"Discerning the Time"},{"num":54,"verse":"Jesus then said to the crowds gathered around him, “When you see a cloud forming in the west, don’t you say, ‘A storm is brewing’? And then it arrives. "},{"num":55,"verse":"And when you feel the south wind blowing, you say, ‘A heat wave is on the way.’ And so it happens. "},{"num":56,"verse":"What hypocrites! You are such experts at forecasting the weather, but you are totally unwilling to understand the spiritual significance of the time you’re living in."},{"num":57,"verse":"“You can’t even judge for yourselves what is good and right."},{"num":58,"verse":"“When you are guilty of wrong-doing, it is better to agree with your adversary and settle your dispute before you have to go before a judge. If not, your adversary may drag you into court, and the judge may find you guilty and "},{"num":59,"verse":"throw you into prison until you have paid off your fine entirely.”"}]
