"},{"num":3,"verse":"Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed on the housetops. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body but after that can do no more. "},{"num":5,"verse":"I shall show you whom to fear. Be afraid of the one who after killing has the power to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, be afraid of that one. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them has escaped the notice of God. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Even the hairs of your head have all been counted. Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.

"},{"num":9,"verse":"But whoever denies me before others will be denied before the angels of God."},{"num":10,"verse":"“Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who blasphemes against the holy Spirit will not be forgiven. "},{"num":11,"verse":"When they take you before synagogues and before rulers and authorities, do not worry about how or what your defense will be or about what you are to say. "},{"num":12,"verse":"For the holy Spirit will teach you at that moment what you should say.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Saying Against Greed. Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"He replied to him, “Friend, who appointed me as your judge and arbitrator?” "},{"num":15,"verse":"Then he said to the crowd, “Take care to guard against all greed, for though one may be rich, one’s life does not consist of possessions.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"Parable of the Rich Fool.

He said to [his] disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life and what you will eat, or about your body and what you will wear. "},{"num":23,"verse":"For life is more than food and the body more than clothing. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Notice the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn, yet God feeds them. How much more important are you than birds!

"},{"num":32,"verse":"Do not be afraid any longer, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom. "},{"num":33,"verse":"Sell your belongings and give alms. Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy. "},{"num":34,"verse":"For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be."},{"num":35,"verse":"“Gird your loins and light your lamps "},{"num":36,"verse":"and be like servants who await their master’s return from a wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.

"},{"num":45,"verse":"But if that servant says to himself, ‘My master is delayed in coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, to eat and drink and get drunk, "},{"num":46,"verse":"then that servant’s master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour and will punish him severely and assign him a place with the unfaithful. "},{"num":47,"verse":"That servant who knew his master’s will but did not make preparations nor act in accord with his will shall be beaten severely; "},{"num":48,"verse":"and the servant who was ignorant of his master’s will but acted in a way deserving of a severe beating shall be beaten only lightly. Much will be required of the person entrusted with much, and still more will be demanded of the person entrusted with more."},{"num":49,"verse":"“I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already blazing!
