But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. "},{"num":8,"verse":"I myself am a man who is under authority. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes. I tell that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at the commander. Jesus turned to the crowd that was following him.
