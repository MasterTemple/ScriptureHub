"},{"num":3,"verse":"So Yeshua said to the Torah lawyers and the Pharisees, “Is it permitted to heal on Shabbat, or not?”"},{"num":4,"verse":"But they kept silent. So Yeshua took hold of him and healed him, and He sent him away. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Then He said to them, “Which of you, with a son or an ox falling into a well on Yom Shabbat, will not immediately pull him out?”"},{"num":6,"verse":" And they could not reply to these things."},{"num":7,"verse":"Yeshua began telling a parable to those who had been invited, when He noticed how they were choosing the seats of honor. He said to them, "},{"num":8,"verse":"“When you are invited by someone to a wedding, don’t take the seat of honor, for someone more highly esteemed than you may have been invited by him.
