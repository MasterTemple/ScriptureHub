[{"header":"Chapter 15"},{"num":1,"verse":"The Parable of the Lost Sheep. The tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to him, "},{"num":2,"verse":"but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"So to them he addressed this parable. "},{"num":4,"verse":"“What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds it? "},{"num":5,"verse":"And when he does find it, he sets it on his shoulders with great joy "},{"num":6,"verse":"and, upon his arrival home, he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.’ "},{"num":7,"verse":"I tell you, in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance."},{"num":8,"verse":"The Parable of the Lost Coin. “Or what woman having ten coins and losing one would not light a lamp and sweep the house, searching carefully until she finds it? "},{"num":9,"verse":"And when she does find it, she calls together her friends and neighbors and says to them, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost.’ "},{"num":10,"verse":"In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"The Parable of the Lost Son. Then he said, “A man had two sons, "},{"num":12,"verse":"and the younger son said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of your estate that should come to me.’ So the father divided the property between them. "},{"num":13,"verse":"After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings and set off to a distant country where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation. "},{"num":14,"verse":"When he had freely spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he found himself in dire need. "},{"num":15,"verse":"So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens who sent him to his farm to tend the swine. "},{"num":16,"verse":"And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed, but nobody gave him any. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Coming to his senses he thought, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have more than enough food to eat, but here am I, dying from hunger. "},{"num":18,"verse":"I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. "},{"num":19,"verse":"I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.”’ "},{"num":20,"verse":"So he got up and went back to his father. While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him. "},{"num":21,"verse":"His son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son.’ "},{"num":22,"verse":"But his father ordered his servants, ‘Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. "},{"num":23,"verse":"Take the fattened calf and slaughter it. Then let us celebrate with a feast, "},{"num":24,"verse":"because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again; he was lost, and has been found.’ Then the celebration began. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Now the older son had been out in the field and, on his way back, as he neared the house, he heard the sound of music and dancing. "},{"num":26,"verse":"He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean. "},{"num":27,"verse":"The servant said to him, ‘Your brother has returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’ "},{"num":28,"verse":"He became angry, and when he refused to enter the house, his father came out and pleaded with him. "},{"num":29,"verse":"He said to his father in reply, ‘Look, all these years I served you and not once did I disobey your orders; yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends. "},{"num":30,"verse":"But when your son returns who swallowed up your property with prostitutes, for him you slaughter the fattened calf.’ "},{"num":31,"verse":"He said to him, ‘My son, you are here with me always; everything I have is yours. "},{"num":32,"verse":"But now we must celebrate and rejoice, because your brother was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.’”"}]
