"},{"num":4,"verse":"While they were ·wondering [puzzling; perplexed] about this, two men in ·shining [dazzling; gleaming like lightning; 9:29] clothes suddenly stood beside them. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The women were ·very afraid [terrified] and bowed their ·heads [faces] to the ground. The men said to them, “Why are you looking for ·a living person in this place for the dead [the living among the dead]? "},{"num":6,"verse":"He is not here; he has risen from the dead. Do you remember what he told you [while he was still] in Galilee? "},{"num":7,"verse":"He said the Son of Man must be ·handed over [betrayed] to sinful people, be crucified, and rise from the dead on the third day.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then the women remembered what Jesus had said."},{"num":9,"verse":"The women ·left [returned from] the tomb and told all these things to ·the eleven apostles [the Eleven] and ·the other followers [all the rest]. "},{"num":10,"verse":"It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some other women who told the apostles ·everything that had happened at the tomb [these things]. "},{"num":11,"verse":"But they did not believe the women, because it ·sounded [seemed] like nonsense. "},{"num":12,"verse":"But Peter got up and ran to the tomb.

"},{"num":21,"verse":"But we were hoping that he would ·free [rescue; redeem] Israel. Besides [all] this, it is now the third day since this happened. "},{"num":22,"verse":"·And [But also; Moreover] some women among us ·amazed [astonished] us. Early this morning they went to the tomb, "},{"num":23,"verse":"but they did not find his body there. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said that Jesus was alive! "},{"num":24,"verse":"So some of our group went to the tomb, too. They found it just as the women said, but they did not see Jesus.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"Then Jesus said to them, “·You are foolish [O foolish ones] and slow [in heart] to believe everything the prophets said. "},{"num":26,"verse":"·They said [Was it not necessary…?] that the ·Christ [Messiah] must suffer these things before he enters his glory.” "},{"num":27,"verse":"Then starting with what Moses and all the prophets [a way of referring to the whole Old Testament] had said about him, Jesus began to explain everything that had been written about himself in [all] the Scriptures."},{"num":28,"verse":"They came near the town ·of Emmaus [to which they were going], and Jesus acted as if he were going farther. "},{"num":29,"verse":"But they ·begged [urged] him, “Stay with us, because it is late; it is almost night.” So he went in to stay with them."},{"num":30,"verse":"When Jesus ·was at the table [reclined; the posture of a formal meal] with them, he took some bread, ·gave thanks [blessed it], ·divided [broke] it, and gave it to them [Jesus, the guest, functions like the host in a Eucharist-like meal]. "},{"num":31,"verse":"And then, ·they were allowed to recognize Jesus [their eyes were opened]. But when they saw who he was, he disappeared. "},{"num":32,"verse":"They said to each other, “·It felt like a fire burning in [Didn’t our hearts burn within…?] us when Jesus talked to us on the road and ·explained [opened] the Scriptures to us.”"},{"num":33,"verse":"So ·the two followers [they] got up ·at once [the same hour] and went back to Jerusalem.

"},{"num":41,"verse":"While they still could not believe it because they were happy [joyful] and amazed, Jesus said to them, “Do you have any food here?” "},{"num":42,"verse":"They gave him a piece of broiled fish.
