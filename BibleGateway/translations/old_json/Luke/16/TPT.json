[{"header":"The Dishonest Manager"},{"num":16,"verse":"Jesus taught his disciples using this story:"},{"num":2,"verse":"So the master called him in and said, ‘Is it true that you are mismanaging my estate? You need to provide me with a complete audit of everything you oversee for me. I’ve decided to dismiss you.’"},{"num":3,"verse":"“The manager thought, ‘Now what am I going to do? I’m finished here. I can’t hide what I’ve done, and I’m too proud to beg. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I have an idea that will secure my future. It will win me favor and secure friends who can take care of me and help me when I get fired!’"},{"num":5,"verse":"“So the dishonest manager hatched his scheme. He went to everyone who owed his master money, one by one, and asked them, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ "},{"num":6,"verse":"One debtor owed twenty thousand dollars, so he said to him, ‘Let me see your bill. Pay me now and we’ll settle for twenty percent less.’ The clever manager scratched out the original amount owed and reduced it by twenty percent. And to another who owed two hundred thousand dollars, he said, ‘Pay me now and we’ll reduce your bill by fifty percent.’ And the clever manager scratched out the original amount owed and reduced it by half."},{"num":8,"verse":"“Even though his master was defrauded, when he found out about the shrewd way this manager had feathered his own nest, he congratulated the clever scoundrel for what he’d done to provide for his future.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Use the wealth of this world to demonstrate your friendship with God by winning friends and blessing others. Then, when it runs out, your generosity will provide you with an eternal reward."},{"num":10,"verse":"“The one who faithfully manages the little he has been given will be promoted and trusted with greater responsibilities. But those who cheat with the little they have been given will not be considered trustworthy to receive more.

"},{"num":12,"verse":"And if you’ve not proven yourself faithful with what belongs to another, why should you be given wealth of your own? "},{"num":13,"verse":"It is impossible for a person to serve two masters at the same time. You will be forced to love one and reject the other. One master will be despised and the other will have your loyal devotion. Your choice between God and the wealth of this world is no different. You must enthusiastically love one and definitively reject the other.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Now, the Jewish religious leaders listening to Jesus were lovers of money. They laughed at what he said and mocked his teachings, "},{"num":15,"verse":"so Jesus addressed them directly. “You always want to look spiritual in the eyes of others, but you have forgotten the eyes of God, which see what is inside you. The very things that you approve of and applaud are the things God despises. "},{"num":16,"verse":"The law of Moses and the revelation of the prophets have prepared you for the arrival of the kingdom announced by John. Since that time, the wonderful news of God’s kingdom is being preached, and people’s hearts burn with extreme passion to receive it.

In hell he looked up from his torment and saw Abraham in the distance, and Lazarus was standing beside him in the glory. "},{"num":24,"verse":"The rich man shouted, ‘Father Abraham! Father Abraham! Have mercy on me. Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and come to cool my tongue, for I am in agony in these flames of fire!’"},{"num":25,"verse":"“But Abraham responded, ‘My friend, don’t you remember? While you were alive, you had all you desired. You surrounded yourself in luxury, while Lazarus had nothing. Now Lazarus dwells in the comforts of paradise and you are in agony.
