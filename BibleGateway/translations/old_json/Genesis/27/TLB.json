[{"num":27,"verse":"One day, in Isaac’s old age when he was almost blind, he called for Esau his oldest son."},{"num":2,"verse":"Isaac: “I am an old man now, and expect every day to be my last. Take your bow and arrows out into the fields and get me some venison, and prepare it just the way I like it—savory and good—and bring it here for me to eat, and I will give you the blessings that belong to you, my firstborn son, before I die.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"But Rebekah overheard the conversation. So when Esau left for the field to hunt for the venison, "},{"num":6,"verse":"she called her son Jacob and told him what his father had said to his brother."},{"num":8,"verse":"Rebekah: “Now do exactly as I tell you. Go out to the flocks and bring me two young goats, and I’ll prepare your father’s favorite dish from them. Then take it to your father, and after he has enjoyed it he will bless you before his death, instead of Esau!”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Jacob: “But Mother! He won’t be fooled that easily. Think how hairy Esau is, and how smooth my skin is! What if my father feels me?

Go out and get the goats.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"So Jacob followed his mother’s instructions, bringing the dressed kids, which she prepared in his father’s favorite way.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"And she made him a pair of gloves from the hairy skin of the young goats, and fastened a strip of the hide around his neck; "},{"num":17,"verse":"then she gave him the meat, with its rich aroma, and some fresh-baked bread."},{"num":18,"verse":"Jacob carried the platter of food into the room where his father was lying."},{"num":19,"verse":"Jacob: “It’s Esau, your oldest son.
