"},{"num":4,"verse":"They hadn’t gone very far from the city when Joseph spoke to his manager. “Go after those men right away,” he said. “Catch up with them. Say to them, ‘My master was good to you. Why have you paid him back by doing evil? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Isn’t this the cup my master drinks from? Doesn’t he also use it to find things out? You have done an evil thing.’ ”"},{"num":6,"verse":"When the manager caught up with them, he told them what Joseph had said. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But they said to him, “Why do you say these things? We would never do anything like that! "},{"num":8,"verse":"We even brought back to you from Canaan the money we found in our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?
