[{"header":"Jacob Meets Rachel"},{"num":29,"verse":"Then Jacob went on his way and came to the land of the people of the East [near Haran]. "},{"num":2,"verse":"As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and three flocks of sheep lying there [resting] beside it because the flocks were watered from that well. Now the stone on the mouth of the well [that covered and protected it] was large, "},{"num":3,"verse":"and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, water the sheep, and [afterward] replace the stone on the mouth of the well."},{"num":4,"verse":"Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"So he said to them, “Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor [Abraham’s brother]?” And they replied, “We know him.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"And he asked them, “Is it well with him?” And they said, “He is doing well; look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep!” "},{"num":7,"verse":"Jacob said, “Look, the sun is still high [overhead]; it is a long time before the flocks need to be gathered [in their folds for the night]. Water the sheep, and go, and return them to their pasture.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"But they said, “We cannot [leave] until all the flocks are gathered together, and the shepherds roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we will water the sheep.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. "},{"num":10,"verse":"When Jacob saw [his cousin] Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and Laban’s sheep, he came up and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban, his uncle.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"Then Laban said to him, “You are my bone and my flesh.” And Jacob stayed with him a month."},{"num":15,"verse":"Then Laban said to Jacob, “Just because you are my relative, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me, what should your wages be?” "},{"num":16,"verse":"Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, “I will serve you [as a hired workman] for seven years [in return] for [the privilege of marrying] Rachel your younger daughter.” "},{"num":19,"verse":"Laban said, “It is better that I give her [in marriage] to you than give her to another man.

"},{"num":23,"verse":"But in the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob went in to [consummate the marriage with] her.
