"},{"num":6,"verse":"He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had: "},{"num":7,"verse":"There we were, binding sheaves of grain in the middle of the field. Suddenly my sheaf rose up and stood upright and your sheaves surrounded my sheaf and bowed down to it!” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then his brothers asked him, “Do you really think you will rule over us or have dominion over us?” They hated him even more because of his dream and because of what he said."},{"num":9,"verse":"Then he had another dream, and told it to his brothers. “Look,” he said. “I had another dream.
