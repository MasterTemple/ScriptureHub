I ·have no son [am childless], so my ·slave [servant] Eliezer from Damascus [a major city in Syria] will ·get everything I own after I die [be my heir; a household servant would take care of a childless couple in their old age and in turn inherit their possessions].” "},{"num":3,"verse":"Abram said, “Look, you have given me no son, so a slave born in my house will ·inherit everything I have [be my heir].”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the Lord spoke his word to Abram: “He will not be the one to inherit what you have.
