"},{"num":5,"verse":"No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I am making you the father of a multitude of nations. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I will make you exceedingly fertile; I will make nations of you; kings will stem from you. "},{"num":7,"verse":"I will maintain my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout the ages as an everlasting covenant, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
