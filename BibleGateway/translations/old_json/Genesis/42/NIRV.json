Then we’ll live and not die.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain there. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But Jacob didn’t send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with them. He was afraid Benjamin might be harmed. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Israel’s sons were among the people who went to buy grain. There wasn’t enough food in the land of Canaan."},{"num":6,"verse":"Joseph was the governor of the land. He was the one who sold grain to all its people. When Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. "},{"num":7,"verse":"As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them. But he pretended to be a stranger. He spoke to them in a mean way. “Where do you come from?” he asked."},{"num":8,"verse":"Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Joseph remembered his dreams about them. So he said to them, “You are spies!

Then you won’t die.” So they did what he said."},{"num":21,"verse":"They said to one another, “God is surely punishing us because of our brother.

He saw his money in the top of his sack. "},{"num":28,"verse":"“My money has been given back,” he said to his brothers. “Here it is in my sack.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"They came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. They told him everything that had happened to them. They said, "},{"num":30,"verse":"“The man who is the governor of the land spoke to us in a mean way. He treated us as if we were spying on the land. "},{"num":31,"verse":"But we said to him, ‘We’re honest men. We aren’t spies. "},{"num":32,"verse":"We were 12 brothers. All of us were the sons of one father. But now one brother is gone.
