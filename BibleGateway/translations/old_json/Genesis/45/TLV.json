"},{"num":2,"verse":"But he gave his voice to weeping so that the Egyptians heard, and Pharaoh’s household heard. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” And his brothers were unable to answer him because they were terrified at his presence."},{"num":4,"verse":"Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near me.” So they came near. “I’m Joseph, your brother—the one you sold to Egypt,” he said. "},{"num":5,"verse":"“So now, don’t be grieved and don’t be angry in your own eyes that you sold me here—since it was for preserving life that God sent me here before you.

"},{"num":7,"verse":"But God sent me ahead of you to ensure a remnant in the land and to keep you alive for a great escape. "},{"num":8,"verse":"So now, it wasn’t you, you didn’t send me here, but God!
