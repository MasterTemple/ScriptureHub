After the meal, "},{"num":4,"verse":"as they were preparing to retire for the night, the men of the city—yes, Sodomites, young and old from all over the city—surrounded the house "},{"num":5,"verse":"and shouted to Lot, “Bring out those men to us so we can rape them.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him. "},{"num":7,"verse":"“Please, fellows,” he begged, “don’t do such a wicked thing. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Look—I have two virgin daughters, and I’ll surrender them to you to do with as you wish. But leave these men alone, for they are under my protection.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"“Stand back,” they yelled. “Who do you think you are? We let this fellow settle among us and now he tries to tell us what to do! We’ll deal with you far worse than with those other men.” And they lunged at Lot and began breaking down the door."},{"num":10,"verse":"But the two men reached out and pulled Lot in and bolted the door "},{"num":11,"verse":"and temporarily blinded the men of Sodom so that they couldn’t find the door."},{"num":12,"verse":"“What relatives do you have here in the city?” the men asked. “Get them out of this place—sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else.

The stench of the place has reached to heaven and God has sent us to destroy it.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"So Lot rushed out to tell his daughters’ fiancés, “Quick, get out of the city, for the Lord is going to destroy it.” But the young men looked at him as though he had lost his senses."},{"num":15,"verse":"At dawn the next morning the angels became urgent. “Hurry,” they said to Lot, “take your wife and your two daughters who are here and get out while you can, or you will be caught in the destruction of the city.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"When Lot still hesitated, the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety, outside the city, for the Lord was merciful."},{"num":17,"verse":"“Flee for your lives,” the angels told him. “And don’t look back. Escape to the mountains. Don’t stay down here on the plain or you will die.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"“Oh no, sirs, please,” Lot begged, “since you’ve been so kind to me and saved my life, and you’ve granted me such mercy, let me flee to that little village over there instead of into the mountains, for I fear disaster in the mountains. See, the village is close by and it is just a small one. Please, please, let me go there instead. Don’t you see how small it is? And my life will be saved.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"“All right,” the angel said, “I accept your proposition and won’t destroy that little city. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But hurry! For I can do nothing until you are there.” (From that time on that village was named Zoar, meaning “Little City.”)"},{"num":23,"verse":"The sun was rising as Lot reached the village. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Then the Lord rained down fire and flaming tar from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah, "},{"num":25,"verse":"and utterly destroyed them, along with the other cities and villages of the plain, eliminating all life—people, plants, and animals alike.

"},{"num":28,"verse":"He looked out across the plain to Sodom and Gomorrah and saw columns of smoke and fumes, as from a furnace, rising from the cities there. "},{"num":29,"verse":"So God heeded Abraham’s plea and kept Lot safe, removing him from the maelstrom of death that engulfed the cities."},{"num":30,"verse":"Afterwards Lot left Zoar, fearful of the people there, and went to live in a cave in the mountains with his two daughters. "},{"num":31,"verse":"One day the older girl said to her sister, “There isn’t a man anywhere in this entire area that our father would let us marry. And our father will soon be too old for having children. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Come, let’s fill him with wine and then we will sleep with him, so that our clan will not come to an end.” "},{"num":33,"verse":"So they got him drunk that night, and the older girl went in and had sexual intercourse with her father; but he was unaware of her lying down or getting up again."},{"num":34,"verse":"The next morning she said to her younger sister, “I slept with my father last night. Let’s fill him with wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him, so that our family line will continue.” "},{"num":35,"verse":"So they got him drunk again that night, and the younger girl went in and lay with him, and, as before, he didn’t know that anyone was there. "},{"num":36,"verse":"And so it was that both girls became pregnant from their father. "},{"num":37,"verse":"The older girl’s baby was named Moab; he became the ancestor of the nation of the Moabites.
