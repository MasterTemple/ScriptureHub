I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force. "},{"num":32,"verse":"But if you find anyone who has the statues of your gods, that person will not remain alive. While our relatives are watching, look for yourself. See if there’s anything of yours here with me.

I haven’t eaten rams from your flocks. "},{"num":39,"verse":"I didn’t bring you animals torn apart by wild beasts. I made up for the loss myself. Also, you made me pay for anything stolen by day or night. "},{"num":40,"verse":"And what was my life like? The heat burned me in the daytime. And it was so cold at night that I froze. I couldn’t sleep. "},{"num":41,"verse":"That’s what it was like for the 20 years I was living with you. I worked for 14 years to marry your two daughters. I worked for six years to get my share of your flocks. You changed my pay ten times. "},{"num":42,"verse":"But the God of my father was with me. He is the God of Abraham and the God Isaac worshiped.

So last night he warned you.”"},{"num":43,"verse":"Laban answered Jacob, “The women are my daughters. The children are my children. The flocks are my flocks. Everything you see is mine.
