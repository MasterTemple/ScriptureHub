"},{"num":5,"verse":"He said to them, “I have seen that your father is not as friendly with me as he used to be. But the God of my father has been with me. "},{"num":6,"verse":"You both know that I have worked as hard as I could for your father. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But he cheated me. He has changed my pay ten times. But God has not allowed your father to harm me. "},{"num":8,"verse":"At one time Laban said, ‘You can have all the speckled goats as your pay.’ After that, all the animals gave birth to speckled young ones. But then Laban said, ‘You can have all the streaked goats as your pay.’ After that, all the animals gave birth to streaked babies.

You took my daughters as if you had captured them in a war. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Why did you run away without telling me? Why did you trick me? Why didn’t you tell me?

I thought you would take your daughters away from me. "},{"num":32,"verse":"If you find anyone here who has taken your idols, he will be killed! Your relatives will be my witnesses. You may look for anything that belongs to you. Take anything that is yours.” (Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban’s idols.)"},{"num":33,"verse":"So Laban looked in Jacob’s tent and in Leah’s tent.

What law have I broken to cause you to chase me? "},{"num":37,"verse":"You have looked through everything I own. But you have found nothing that belongs to you. If you have found anything, show it to everyone. Put it in front of your relatives and my relatives. Then let them decide which one of us is right.

"},{"num":39,"verse":"Any time a sheep was killed by wild animals, I did not bring it to you. I made up for the loss myself. You made me pay for any animal that was stolen during the day or night.
