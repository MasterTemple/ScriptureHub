But the God of my father has been with me. "},{"num":6,"verse":"You know that I have served your father with all my strength; "},{"num":7,"verse":"yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me. "},{"num":8,"verse":"If he said, “The speckled shall be your wages”, then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said, “The striped shall be your wages”, then all the flock bore striped.
