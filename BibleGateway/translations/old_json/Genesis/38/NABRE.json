She was in Chezib when she bore him."},{"num":6,"verse":"Judah got a wife named Tamar for his firstborn, Er. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But Er, Judah’s firstborn, greatly offended the Lord; so the Lord took his life. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Judah said to Onan, “Have intercourse with your brother’s wife, in fulfillment of your duty as brother-in-law, and thus preserve your brother’s line.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Onan, however, knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he had intercourse with his brother’s wife, he wasted his seed on the ground, to avoid giving offspring to his brother. "},{"num":10,"verse":"What he did greatly offended the Lord, and the Lord took his life too. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up”—for he feared that Shelah also might die like his brothers.

"},{"num":15,"verse":"When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, since she had covered her face. "},{"num":16,"verse":"So he went over to her at the roadside and said, “Come, let me have intercourse with you,” for he did not realize that she was his daughter-in-law. She replied, “What will you pay me for letting you have intercourse with me?” "},{"num":17,"verse":"He answered, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” “Very well,” she said, “provided you leave me a pledge until you send it.” "},{"num":18,"verse":"Judah asked, “What pledge should I leave you?” She answered, “Your seal and cord, and the staff in your hand.” So he gave them to her and had intercourse with her, and she conceived by him. "},{"num":19,"verse":"After she got up and went away, she took off her shawl and put on her widow’s garments again."},{"num":20,"verse":"Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to recover the pledge from the woman; but he did not find her.
