[{"header":"Joseph Interprets Two Dreams"},{"num":40,"verse":"After these things happened, two of the king of Egypt’s officers ·displeased [offended; sinned against] the king—·the man who served wine [cupbearer] to the king and the king’s baker [two important positions in the king’s court]. "},{"num":2,"verse":"·The king [Pharaoh] became angry with his ·officer who served him wine and his [chief cupbearer and chief] baker, "},{"num":3,"verse":"so he put them in the prison of the chief butcher [37:36], the same ·prison [round house] where Joseph was ·kept [confined]. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The chief butcher [37:36] put the two prisoners in Joseph’s care, and they stayed in prison for some time."},{"num":5,"verse":"One night both the king’s ·officer who served him wine and the [cupbearer and] baker had a dream. Each had his own dream with its own meaning. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw they were ·worried [troubled]. "},{"num":7,"verse":"He asked ·the king’s [Pharaoh’s] officers who were with him, “Why ·do you look so unhappy [do you look so bad; are your faces bad/evil] today?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"The two men answered, “We both had dreams last night, but no one can explain their meaning to us.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So the ·man who served wine to the king [chief cupbearer] told Joseph his dream. He said, “I dreamed I saw a vine, and "},{"num":10,"verse":"on the vine were three branches. I watched the branches bud and blossom, and then the [cluster of] grapes ripened. "},{"num":11,"verse":"I was holding ·the king’s [Pharaoh’s] cup, so I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup.

The three branches stand for three days. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Before the end of three days the king will ·free you [lift up your head], and he will allow you to return to your work. You will ·serve the king his wine just as you did before [give the cup into the hand of Pharaoh according to your former custom when you were his cupbearer]. "},{"num":14,"verse":"But when ·you are free [it goes well for you], remember me. Be ·kind [loyal] to me, and ·tell the king about me [recall me to the king] so I can get out of this ·prison [house]. "},{"num":15,"verse":"I was ·taken by force [stolen; snatched] from the land of the Hebrews, and I have done nothing here to deserve being put in ·prison [the pit; dungeon].”"},{"num":16,"verse":"The [chief] baker saw that ·Joseph’s explanation of the dream [the interpretation] was ·good [favorable], so he said to him, “I also had a dream. I dreamed there were three bread baskets on my head. "},{"num":17,"verse":"In the top basket were all kinds of baked food for ·the king [Pharaoh], but the birds were eating this food out of the basket on my head.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Joseph answered, “·I will tell you what the dream means [This is its interpretation].
