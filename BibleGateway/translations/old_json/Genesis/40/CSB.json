"},{"num":4,"verse":"The captain of the guards assigned Joseph to them as their personal attendant, and they were in custody for some time."},{"num":5,"verse":"The king of Egypt’s cupbearer and baker, who were confined in the prison, each had a dream. Both had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they looked distraught. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?” "},{"num":8,"verse":"“We had dreams,” they said to him, “but there is no one to interpret them.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph: “In my dream there was a vine in front of me. "},{"num":10,"verse":"On the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms came out and its clusters ripened into grapes. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"“This is its interpretation,” Joseph said to him. “The three branches are three days.
