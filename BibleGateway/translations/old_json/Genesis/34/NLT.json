I want to marry her.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Soon Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter, Dinah. But since his sons were out in the fields herding his livestock, he said nothing until they returned."},{"num":6,"verse":"Hamor, Shechem’s father, came to discuss the matter with Jacob."},{"num":7,"verse":"Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the field as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious that their sister had been raped. Shechem had done a disgraceful thing against Jacob’s family, something that should never be done."},{"num":8,"verse":"Hamor tried to speak with Jacob and his sons. “My son Shechem is truly in love with your daughter,” he said. “Please let him marry her."},{"num":9,"verse":"In fact, let’s arrange other marriages, too.

You’ve made me stink among all the people of this land—among all the Canaanites and Perizzites. We are so few that they will join forces and crush us. I will be ruined, and my entire household will be wiped out!”"},{"num":31,"verse":"“But why should we let him treat our sister like a prostitute?” they retorted angrily."}]
