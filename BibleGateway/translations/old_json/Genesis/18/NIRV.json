He bowed low to the ground."},{"num":3,"verse":"He said, “My lord, if you are pleased with me, don’t pass me by. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Let me get you some water. Then all of you can wash your feet and rest under this tree. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Let me get you something to eat to give you strength. Then you can go on your way. I want to do this for you now that you have come to me.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick!” he said. “Get about 36 pounds of the finest flour. Prepare it and bake some bread.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then he ran over to the herd. He picked out a choice, tender calf. He gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he brought some butter and milk and the calf that had been prepared. He served them to the three men.

Your wife Sarah will have a son.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Abraham and Sarah were already very old. Sarah was too old to have a baby. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So she laughed to herself. She thought, “I’m worn out, and my husband is old. Can I really know the joy of having a baby?”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Then the Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh?

He must direct his children to live in the way that pleases me. And he must direct the members of his family after him to do the same. So he must guide all of them in doing what is right and fair.

Won’t you spare the place because of the 50 godly people in it? "},{"num":25,"verse":"You would never kill godly people along with those who are evil, would you? Would you treat them all alike?
