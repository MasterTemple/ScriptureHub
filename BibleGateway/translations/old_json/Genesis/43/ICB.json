He said, ‘Bring your brother back with you. If you don’t, you will not be allowed to see me.’ "},{"num":4,"verse":"If you will send Benjamin with us, we will go down and buy food for you. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But if you refuse to send Benjamin, we will not go. The governor of that country warned us. He said we would not see him if we didn’t bring Benjamin with us.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Jacob, also called Israel, said, “Why did you tell the man you had another brother? You have caused me a lot of trouble.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The brothers answered, “He questioned us carefully about ourselves and our family. He asked us, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ We just answered his questions. How could we know he would ask us to bring our other brother to him?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Judah said to his father Jacob, “Send Benjamin with me. Then we will go at once. Do this so that we, you and our children may live and not die. "},{"num":9,"verse":"I will guarantee you that he will be safe. I will be personally responsible for him.

And they took Benjamin. They hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph."},{"num":16,"verse":"In Egypt Joseph saw Benjamin with them. Joseph said to the servant in charge of his house, “Bring those men into my house. Kill an animal and prepare a meal. Those men will eat with me today at noon.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"The servant did as Joseph told him. He brought the men to Joseph’s house."},{"num":18,"verse":"The brothers were afraid when they were brought to Joseph’s house. They thought, “We were brought here because of the money that was put in our sacks on the first trip.

Each of us found all his money in his sack. We brought that money with us to give it back to you. "},{"num":22,"verse":"And we have brought more money. It is to pay for the food we want to buy this time. We don’t know who put that money in our sacks.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"But the servant answered, “It’s all right. Don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, must have put the money in your sacks. I got the money you paid me for the grain last time.” Then the servant brought Simeon out to them."},{"num":24,"verse":"The servant led the men into Joseph’s house.

Joseph asked, “Is this your youngest brother you told me about?” Then Joseph said to Benjamin, “God be good to you, my son!” "},{"num":30,"verse":"Then Joseph hurried off. He had to hold back the tears when he saw his brother Benjamin. So Joseph went into his room and cried there. "},{"num":31,"verse":"Then he washed his face and came out. He controlled himself and said, “Serve the meal.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"So they served Joseph at one table. They served his brothers at another table. And they served the Egyptians who ate with him at another table. This was because Egyptians did not like Hebrews and never ate with them.
