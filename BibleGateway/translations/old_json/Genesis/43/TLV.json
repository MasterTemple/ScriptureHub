"},{"num":5,"verse":"But if you won’t send him, we won’t go down, because the man said to us, ‘You won’t see my face unless your brother is with you.’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Then Israel said, “Why did you do evil to me by telling the man that you have another brother?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"They said, “The man questioned particularly about us and about our relatives saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have a brother?’ So we spoke to him on the basis of these words. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’”?"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Please, send the boy with me and we’ll get up and go, so that we’ll live and not die—we and you, and our children.

Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for the men will eat with me this afternoon. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So the man did as Joseph said, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house. "},{"num":18,"verse":"But the men were afraid, because they had been brought into Joseph’s house.
