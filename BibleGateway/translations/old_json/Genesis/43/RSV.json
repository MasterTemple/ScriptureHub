"},{"num":2,"verse":"And when they had eaten the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little food.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ "},{"num":4,"verse":"If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food; "},{"num":5,"verse":"but if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’” "},{"num":6,"verse":"Israel said, “Why did you treat me so ill as to tell the man that you had another brother?” "},{"num":7,"verse":"They replied, “The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ What we told him was in answer to these questions; could we in any way know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?” "},{"num":8,"verse":"And Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones. "},{"num":9,"verse":"I will be surety for him; of my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame for ever; "},{"num":10,"verse":"for if we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man a present, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.

If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.” "},{"num":15,"verse":"So the men took the present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin; and they arose and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."},{"num":16,"verse":"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"The man did as Joseph bade him, and brought the men to Joseph’s house. "},{"num":18,"verse":"And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph’s house, and they said, “It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, to make slaves of us and seize our asses.” "},{"num":19,"verse":"So they went up to the steward of Joseph’s house, and spoke with him at the door of the house, "},{"num":20,"verse":"and said, “Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food; "},{"num":21,"verse":"and when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was every man’s money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it again with us, "},{"num":22,"verse":"and we have brought other money down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.” "},{"num":23,"verse":"He replied, “Rest assured, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your sacks for you; I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.

God be gracious to you, my son!” "},{"num":30,"verse":"Then Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there. "},{"num":31,"verse":"Then he washed his face and came out; and controlling himself he said, “Let food be served.” "},{"num":32,"verse":"They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians. "},{"num":33,"verse":"And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another in amazement.
