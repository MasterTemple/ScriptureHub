"},{"num":5,"verse":"If you won’t let him go, we won’t go. The man said to us, ‘You won’t be allowed to see me again unless your brother is with you.’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Israel asked, “Why have you made trouble for me by telling the man you had another brother?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"They answered, “The man kept asking about us and our family: ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ We simply answered his questions. How could we possibly know he would say, ‘Bring your brother here’?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy along with me. Let’s get going so that we won’t starve to death. "},{"num":9,"verse":"I guarantee that he will come back. You can hold me responsible for him.

"},{"num":18,"verse":"The men were frightened, because they had been brought to Joseph’s house. They thought, “We’ve been brought here because of the money that was put back into our sacks the first time.

He went into his private room and cried there."},{"num":31,"verse":"Then he washed his face and came out. He was in control of his emotions when he said, “Serve the food.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"He was served separately from his brothers. The Egyptians who were there with him were also served separately, because they found it offensive to eat with Hebrews.
