"},{"num":34,"verse":"They put their hated idols in the place where I have chosen to be worshiped. In this way they made it unclean. "},{"num":35,"verse":"In the Valley of Ben Hinnom those people built places to worship Baal. They built them so they could burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices to Molech. But I never commanded them to do such a hated thing. I never even thought of it! This would make Judah sin."},{"num":36,"verse":"“You are saying, ‘There will be war, hunger and terrible diseases.

In the same way I will bring good things to them. I promise to do good things for them. "},{"num":43,"verse":"You are saying, ‘This land is an empty desert. There are no people or animals here. The Babylonian army defeated this country.’ But in the future, people will once again buy fields in this land. "},{"num":44,"verse":"They will use their money and buy fields. They will sign and seal their agreements. People will witness their signing records of ownership. They will again buy fields in the land of Benjamin and in the area around Jerusalem. They will buy fields in the towns of Judah and in the mountains. They will buy them in the western mountain slopes and in southern Judah. This is because I will make everything as good as it once was,” says the Lord."}]
