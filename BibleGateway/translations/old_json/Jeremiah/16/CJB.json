[{"num":16,"verse":"This word of Adonai came to me: "},{"num":2,"verse":"“You are not to marry or have sons and daughters in this place. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For this is what Adonai says concerning the sons and daughters born here, as well as their mothers who gave birth to them and their fathers who conceived them in this land: "},{"num":4,"verse":"‘They will die terrible deaths without being mourned or buried; they will be left on the ground like dung. They will die by the sword and by famine, and their corpses will be food for the birds in the air and the wild animals.’"},{"num":5,"verse":"“For here is what Adonai says: ‘Do not enter any house where there is mourning; don’t lament them, and don’t grieve for them; for I have removed my shalom from this people, as well as my grace and compassion,’ says Adonai.

What is our iniquity, what is our sin, that we have committed against Adonai our God?’ "},{"num":11,"verse":"then you are to say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors abandoned me, says Adonai, and went after other gods, serving and worshipping them, but abandoned me and did not keep my Torah.
