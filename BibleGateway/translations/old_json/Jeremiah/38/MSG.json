He’s ruining the resolve of the soldiers who are still left in the city, as well as the people themselves, by spreading these words. This man isn’t looking after the good of this people. He’s trying to ruin us!”"},{"num":5,"verse":"King Zedekiah caved in: “If you say so. Go ahead, handle it your way. You’re too much for me.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malkijah the king’s son that was in the courtyard of the palace guard.

And you, don’t think you’ll get out of this—the king of Babylon will seize you and then burn this city to the ground.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Don’t let anyone know of this conversation, if you know what’s good for you. If the government officials get wind that I’ve been talking with you, they may come and say, ‘Tell us what went on between you and the king, what you said and what he said. Hold nothing back and we won’t kill you.’ If this happens, tell them, ‘I presented my case to the king so that he wouldn’t send me back to the dungeon of Jonathan to die there.’”"},{"num":27,"verse":"And sure enough, all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him.
