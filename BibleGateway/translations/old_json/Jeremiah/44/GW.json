"},{"num":2,"verse":"This is what the Lord of Armies, the God of Israel, says: You have seen all the disasters I brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah. Today they are deserted ruins. "},{"num":3,"verse":"It is because their people did evil, and they made me angry. They went to burn incense and serve other gods that neither you nor your ancestors heard of. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I have sent my servants the prophets to you again and again to tell you not to do these detestable things that I hate. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But you wouldn’t listen or pay attention. You wouldn’t turn from your wicked ways and wouldn’t stop burning incense as an offering to other gods. "},{"num":6,"verse":"That is why my fury and anger were poured out and continued to burn in the cities of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem. So they became the desolate ruin that they are today."},{"num":7,"verse":"Now, this is what the Lord God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Why do you bring this terrible disaster on yourselves? Why do you keep destroying men, women, children, and babies from Judah until none are left?

No one lives in that land today. "},{"num":23,"verse":"You burned incense as offerings to other gods, sinned against the Lord, and wouldn’t obey him.
