Look at them; today they are a desolation, without an inhabitant in them, "},{"num":3,"verse":"because of the wickedness that they committed, provoking me to anger, in that they went to make offerings and serve other gods that they had not known, neither they, nor you, nor your ancestors. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, ‘I beg you not to do this abominable thing that I hate!’ "},{"num":5,"verse":"But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their wickedness and make no offerings to other gods.
