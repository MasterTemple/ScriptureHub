"},{"num":3,"verse":"Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, and let me dwell with you in this place. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Do not trust in these deceptive words: “This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"For if you truly amend your ways and your doings, if you truly act justly one with another, "},{"num":6,"verse":"if you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, and the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own hurt, "},{"num":7,"verse":"then I will dwell with you in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your ancestors forever and ever."},{"num":8,"verse":"Here you are, trusting in deceptive words to no avail.
