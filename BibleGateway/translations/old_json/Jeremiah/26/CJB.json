[{"num":26,"verse":"At the beginning of the reign of Y’hoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu, king of Y’hudah, this word came from Adonai: "},{"num":2,"verse":"“Adonai says: ‘Stand in the courtyard of Adonai’s house and speak to the people from all the cities in Y’hudah who come to worship at Adonai’s house; say everything I order you to say to them, and don’t leave out a word.

"},{"num":4,"verse":"So tell them that this is what Adonai says: “If you will not pay attention to me and live according to my Torah, which I have given you, "},{"num":5,"verse":"and listen to what my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, say — I have sent them frequently, but you haven’t listened — "},{"num":6,"verse":"then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city an object of cursing for all the nations of the earth.”’”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The cohanim, the prophets and all the people heard Yirmeyahu speaking these words in the house of Adonai. "},{"num":8,"verse":"When Yirmeyahu had finished saying everything Adonai had ordered him to say to all the people, the cohanim, prophets and all the people seized him, shouting, “You will die for this! "},{"num":9,"verse":"Why have you prophesied in the name of Adonai, ‘This house will become like Shiloh,’ and, ‘This city will become uninhabited ruins’?” The people all crowded in on Yirmeyahu in Adonai’s house."},{"num":10,"verse":"When the officials of Y’hudah heard about it, they came up from the king’s palace to Adonai’s house and sat at the entrance to the New Gate of Adonai’s house.
