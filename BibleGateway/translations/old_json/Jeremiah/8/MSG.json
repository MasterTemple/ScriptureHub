The bones will be left scattered and exposed, to reenter the soil as fertilizer, like manure."},{"num":3,"verse":"“Everyone left—all from this evil generation unlucky enough to still be alive in whatever godforsaken place I will have driven them to—will wish they were dead.” Decree of God-of-the-Angel-Armies."},{"header":"To Know Everything but God’s Word"},{"num":4,"verse":"“Tell them this, God’s Message:"},{"header":"Advancing from One Evil to the Next"}]
