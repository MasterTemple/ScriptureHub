Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite. "},{"num":4,"verse":"When you were born, your umbilical cord wasn’t cut. You weren’t washed with water to make you clean. You weren’t rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloth. "},{"num":5,"verse":"No one who saw you felt sorry enough for you to do any of these things. But you were thrown into an open field. You were rejected when you were born."},{"num":6,"verse":"“‘Then I went by you and saw you kicking around in your own blood. I said to you, “Live.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"I made you grow like a plant in the field. You grew up, matured, and became a young woman. Your breasts developed, and your hair grew.

You increased your acts of prostitution. "},{"num":26,"verse":"You had sex with your lustful neighbors, the Egyptians. You used your prostitution to make me angry."},{"num":27,"verse":"“‘So I used my power against you.

Yet, you aren’t like other prostitutes, because you don’t want to be paid. "},{"num":32,"verse":"You are an adulterous wife who prefers strangers to her husband. "},{"num":33,"verse":"All prostitutes get paid. But you give gifts to all your lovers and bribe them to come to you from all directions to have sex with you. "},{"num":34,"verse":"You are a different kind of prostitute. No one goes after you for favors. You are the opposite. You pay them, and you don’t accept payment."},{"header":"Jerusalem’s Punishment"},{"num":35,"verse":"“‘Listen to the word of Yahweh, you prostitute.

I will have all those who love you and hate you gather around. I will uncover your body for them, and they will see you naked.
