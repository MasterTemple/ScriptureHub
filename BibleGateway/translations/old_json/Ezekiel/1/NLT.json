So wherever the spirit went, the wheels and the living beings also went."},{"num":21,"verse":"When the beings moved, the wheels moved. When the beings stopped, the wheels stopped.

This is what the glory of the Lord looked like to me. When I saw it, I fell face down on the ground, and I heard someone’s voice speaking to me."}]
