Another block of rooms looked out onto the pavement of the outer courtyard. The two blocks were built three levels high and stood across from each other."},{"num":4,"verse":"Between the two blocks of rooms ran a walkway 17 1⁄2 feet wide. It extended the entire 175 feet of the complex, and all the doors faced north."},{"num":5,"verse":"Each of the two upper levels of rooms was narrower than the one beneath it because the upper levels had to allow space for walkways in front of them."},{"num":6,"verse":"Since there were three levels and they did not have supporting columns as in the courtyards, each of the upper levels was set back from the level beneath it."},{"num":7,"verse":"There was an outer wall that separated the rooms from the outer courtyard; it was 87 1⁄2 feet long."},{"num":8,"verse":"This wall added length to the outer block of rooms, which extended for only 87 1⁄2 feet, while the inner block—the rooms toward the Temple—extended for 175 feet."},{"num":9,"verse":"There was an eastern entrance from the outer courtyard to these rooms."},{"num":10,"verse":"On the south side of the Temple there were two blocks of rooms just south of the inner courtyard between the Temple and the outer courtyard.

Here the priests who offer sacrifices to the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. And because these rooms are holy, they will be used to store the sacred offerings—the grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings."},{"num":14,"verse":"When the priests leave the sanctuary, they must not go directly to the outer courtyard. They must first take off the clothes they wore while ministering, because these clothes are holy.
