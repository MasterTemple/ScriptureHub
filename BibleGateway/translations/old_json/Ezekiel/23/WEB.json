"},{"num":8,"verse":"She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her. They caressed her youthful nipples; and they poured out their prostitution on her."},{"num":9,"verse":"“Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted. "},{"num":10,"verse":"These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters; and they killed her with the sword.

"},{"num":20,"verse":"She lusted after their lovers, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

Then declare to them their abominations. "},{"num":37,"verse":"For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them to be devoured. "},{"num":38,"verse":"Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths. "},{"num":39,"verse":"For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, they have done this in the middle of my house."},{"num":40,"verse":"“Furthermore you sisters have sent for men who come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, decorated yourself with ornaments, "},{"num":41,"verse":"and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you set my incense and my oil."},{"num":42,"verse":"“The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. With men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.
