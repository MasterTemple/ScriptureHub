There men fondled and caressed their breasts."},{"num":4,"verse":"“The older girl was named Oholah, and the younger girl was named Oholibah. I married them, and they gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah represents Samaria, and Oholibah represents Jerusalem. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Oholah acted like a prostitute, although she was my wife. She lusted after her Assyrian lovers who lived nearby. "},{"num":6,"verse":"They were governors and commanders clothed in purple. They were all handsome young men who rode on horses. "},{"num":7,"verse":"She became a prostitute for all the important men in Assyria. She dishonored herself with the idols of all those with whom she fell in love. "},{"num":8,"verse":"She continued the prostitution that she started in Egypt. When she was young, men went to bed with her, caressed her breasts, and treated her like a prostitute."},{"num":9,"verse":"“That is why I handed her over to her lovers, to the Assyrians whom she lusted after.

"},{"num":30,"verse":"Your sinning and your prostitution have done this to you, because you lusted after the nations and dishonored yourself with their idols. "},{"num":31,"verse":"You’ve acted the same way as your sister. That is why I will put her cup in your hand. "},{"num":32,"verse":"This is what Adonay Yahweh says:"},{"num":35,"verse":"“This is what Adonay Yahweh says: You have forgotten me and turned your back on me.

"},{"num":37,"verse":"They have committed adultery. Their hands are covered with blood. They commit adultery with their idols. They have sacrificed the children they gave birth to for me as burnt offerings to idols. "},{"num":38,"verse":"They have also done this to me: They have polluted my holy places when they do these things and dishonored the days to worship me. "},{"num":39,"verse":"When they sacrificed their children to their idols, they came into my holy place and dishonored it. That is what they’ve done in my temple."},{"num":40,"verse":"“They even sent messengers to invite men to come from far away. When the men arrived, they washed themselves for the men, painted their eyes, and put on their jewels. "},{"num":41,"verse":"They sat on their fine couches with tables in front of them. They put my incense and my olive oil on their tables."},{"num":42,"verse":"“I heard the noise from a carefree crowd. A large number of people came from the desert, and they put bracelets on the women’s wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads.
