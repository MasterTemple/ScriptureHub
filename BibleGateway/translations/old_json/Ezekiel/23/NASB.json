They prostituted themselves in their youth; there their breasts were squeezed and there their virgin breasts were handled."},{"num":4,"verse":"Their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister. And they became Mine, and they gave birth to sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah and Jerusalem is Oholibah."},{"num":5,"verse":"“Oholah prostituted herself while she was Mine; and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, her neighbors,"},{"num":6,"verse":"who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them handsome young men, horsemen riding on horses."},{"num":7,"verse":"She bestowed her obscene practices on them, all of whom were the choicest men of Assyria; and with all whom she lusted after, with all their idols she defiled herself."},{"num":8,"verse":"She did not abandon her obscene practices from the time in Egypt; for in her youth men had slept with her, and they handled her virgin breasts and poured out their obscene practice on her."},{"num":9,"verse":"Therefore, I handed her over to her lovers, to the Assyrians, after whom she lusted."},{"num":10,"verse":"They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, but they killed her with the sword. So she became a subject of gossip among women, and they executed judgments on her."},{"num":11,"verse":"“Now her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lust than she, and her obscene practices were more than the prostitution of her sister."},{"num":12,"verse":"She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and officials, the ones near, opulently dressed, horsemen riding on horses, all of them handsome young men."},{"num":13,"verse":"And I saw that she had defiled herself; they both took the same way."},{"num":14,"verse":"So she increased her obscene practices.

Then declare to them their abominations."},{"num":37,"verse":"For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. So they have committed adultery with their idols, and even made their sons, whom they bore to Me, pass through the fire to them as food."},{"num":38,"verse":"Again, they have done this to Me: they have defiled My sanctuary on the same day, and have profaned My Sabbaths."},{"num":39,"verse":"For when they slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary on the same day to profane it; and behold, this is what they did within My house."},{"num":40,"verse":"“Furthermore, they have even sent for men who come from a great distance, to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came—for whom you bathed, put makeup on your eyes, and adorned yourselves with jewelry;"},{"num":41,"verse":"and you sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged in front of it on which you had set My incense and My oil."},{"num":42,"verse":"And the sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and heavy drinkers were brought from the wilderness with people from the multitude of humanity. And they put bracelets on the wrists of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads."},{"num":43,"verse":"“Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adulteries, ‘Will they now commit adultery with her when she is like this?’"},{"num":44,"verse":"But they went in to her as they would go in to a prostitute. This is how they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women."},{"num":45,"verse":"But they, righteous people, will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands."},{"num":46,"verse":"“For this is what the Lord God says: ‘Bring up a contingent against them and turn them over to terror and plunder."},{"num":47,"verse":"The contingent will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire."},{"num":48,"verse":"So I will eliminate outrageous conduct from the land, so that all women will take warning and not commit outrageous sin as you have done."},{"num":49,"verse":"Your outrageous conduct will be repaid to you, and you will bear the guilt for your idols; so you will know that I am the Lord God.’”"}]
