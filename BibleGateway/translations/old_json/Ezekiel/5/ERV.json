[{"header":"People of Jerusalem Scattered"},{"num":5,"verse":"“Son of man, after your famine you must do this: Take a sharp sword and use it like a barber’s razor. Shave off your hair and beard. Put the hair on a scale and weigh it. Separate it into three equal parts. Put a third of your hair on the brick that has the picture of the city on it. Burn that hair in that ‘city.’ Then use the sword and cut a third of your hair into small pieces all around the outside of the ‘city.’ Next, throw a third of your hair into the air and let the wind blow it away. This will show that I will pull out my sword and chase some of the people into faraway countries."},{"num":3,"verse":"But then you must get a few of those hairs and wrap them up in your robe."},{"num":4,"verse":"Take some of those hairs and throw them into the fire.
