[{"num":24,"verse":"One day late in December of the ninth year (of King Jehoiachin’s captivity), another message came to me from the Lord."},{"num":2,"verse":"“Son of dust,” he said, “write down this date, for today the king of Babylon has attacked Jerusalem.

Boil the meat well, until the flesh falls off the bones.’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"For the Lord God says: “Woe to Jerusalem, City of Murderers; you are a pot that is pitted with rust and with wickedness. So take out the meat chunk by chunk in whatever order it comes—for none is better than any other. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For her wickedness is evident to all—she boldly murders, leaving blood upon the rocks in open view for all to see; she does not even try to cover it.
