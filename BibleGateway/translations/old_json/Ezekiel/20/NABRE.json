In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to consult the Lord and sat down before me.

As I live, I will not allow myself to be consulted by you!—oracle of the Lord God."},{"num":4,"verse":"Will you judge them? Will you judge, son of man? Tell them about the abominations of their ancestors, "},{"num":5,"verse":"and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: The day I chose Israel, I swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob; I revealed myself to them in the land of Egypt and swore to them, saying: I am the Lord, your God. "},{"num":6,"verse":"That day I swore to bring them out of the land of Egypt to the land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, a jewel among all lands.

Then I considered pouring out my fury and spending my anger against them there in the land of Egypt. "},{"num":9,"verse":"I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be desecrated in the eyes of the nations among whom they were: in the eyes of the nations I had made myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Therefore I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
