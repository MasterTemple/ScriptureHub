It is time for punishment. Those are not shouts of joy in the mountains. Those are cries of panic."},{"num":8,"verse":"Very soon now, I will show you how angry I am. I will show all of my anger against you. I will punish you for the evil things you did. I will make you pay for all the terrible things you did."},{"num":9,"verse":"I will not show you any mercy or feel sorry for you. I am punishing you for the evil things you did.

They will shave their heads to show their sadness."},{"num":19,"verse":"They will throw their silver idols into the streets. They will treat their gold statues like dirty rags, because those things will not be able to save them when the Lord shows his anger. Those things were nothing but a trap that caused the people to fall. They will not give food to the people or put food in their bellies."},{"num":20,"verse":"“They used their beautiful jewelry and made an idol. They were proud of that statue.

You will look for peace, but there will be none."},{"num":26,"verse":"You will hear one sad story after another. You will hear nothing but bad news. You will look for a prophet and ask him for a vision. The priests will have nothing to teach you, and the elders will not have any good advice to give you."},{"num":27,"verse":"Your king will be crying for the people who died. The leaders will wear sackcloth. The common people will be very afraid, because I will pay them back for what they did. I will decide their punishment, and I will punish them. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”"}]
