Why don’t you shepherds feed the flock?"},{"num":3,"verse":"You eat the fat sheep and use their wool to make clothes for yourselves. You kill the fat sheep, but you don’t feed the flock."},{"num":4,"verse":"You have not made the weak strong. You have not cared for the sick sheep. You have not put bandages on the sheep that were hurt. Some of the sheep wandered away, and you did not go get them and bring them back. You did not go to look for the lost sheep. No, you were cruel and severe—that’s the way you tried to lead the sheep!"},{"num":5,"verse":"“‘And now the sheep are scattered because there was no shepherd. They became food for every wild animal, so they were scattered."},{"num":6,"verse":"My flock wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill.

I will search for my sheep and take care of them."},{"num":12,"verse":"If a shepherd is with his sheep when they begin to wander away, he will go searching for them.

I will judge between the male sheep and the male goats."},{"num":18,"verse":"You can eat the grass growing on the good land. So why do you also crush the grass that other sheep want to eat? You can drink plenty of clear water.

You knock down all the weak sheep with your horns. You push until you have forced them away,"},{"num":22,"verse":"so I will save my flock. They will not be caught by wild animals anymore. I will judge between one sheep and another."},{"num":23,"verse":"Then I will put one shepherd over them, my servant David. He will feed them and be their shepherd."},{"num":24,"verse":"Then I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will be the ruler living among them. I, the Lord, have spoken."},{"num":25,"verse":"“And I will make a peace agreement with my sheep. I will take harmful animals away from the land.
