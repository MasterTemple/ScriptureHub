Prophesy, and say to them: This is what the Lord God says to the shepherds: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who have been feeding themselves! Shouldn’t the shepherds feed their flock? "},{"num":3,"verse":"You eat the fat, wear the wool, and butcher the fattened animals, but you do not tend the flock. "},{"num":4,"verse":"You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bandaged the injured, brought back the strays, or sought the lost. Instead, you have ruled them with violence and cruelty. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They were scattered for lack of a shepherd; they became food for all the wild animals when they were scattered. "},{"num":6,"verse":"My flock went astray on all the mountains and every high hill. They were scattered over the whole face of the earth, and there was no one searching or seeking for them."},{"num":7,"verse":"“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. "},{"num":8,"verse":"As I live”—the declaration of the Lord God—“because My flock has become prey and food for every wild animal since they lack a shepherd, for My shepherds do not search for My flock, and because the shepherds feed themselves rather than My flock, "},{"num":9,"verse":"therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord!"},{"num":10,"verse":"“This is what the Lord God says: Look, I am against the shepherds. I will demand My flock from them and prevent them from shepherding the flock.

"},{"num":12,"verse":"As a shepherd looks for his sheep on the day he is among his scattered flock, so I will look for My flock. I will rescue them from all the places where they have been scattered on a cloudy and dark day. "},{"num":13,"verse":"I will bring them out from the peoples, gather them from the countries, and bring them into their own land. I will shepherd them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the land.

There they will lie down in a good grazing place; they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"“I will seek the lost, bring back the strays, bandage the injured, and strengthen the weak, but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will shepherd them with justice."},{"num":17,"verse":"“The Lord God says to you, My flock: I am going to judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and male goats. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Isn’t it enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of the pasture with your feet? Or isn’t it enough that you drink the clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? "},{"num":19,"verse":"Yet My flock has to feed on what your feet have trampled, and drink what your feet have muddied."},{"num":20,"verse":"“Therefore, this is what the Lord God says to them: See, I Myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. "},{"num":21,"verse":"Since you have pushed with flank and shoulder and butted all the weak ones with your horns until you scattered them all over, "},{"num":22,"verse":"I will save My flock, and they will no longer be prey for you.

"},{"num":27,"verse":"The trees of the field will give their fruit, and the land will yield its produce; My flock will be secure in their land. They will know that I am Yahweh when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslave them.
