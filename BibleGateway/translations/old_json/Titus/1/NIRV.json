Before time began, God promised to give that life. And he does not lie. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Now, at just the right time, he has made his promise clear.

I did this because there were some things that hadn’t been finished. I wanted you to put them in order. I also wanted you to appoint elders in every town. I told you how to do it. "},{"num":6,"verse":"An elder must be without blame. He must be faithful to his wife. His children must be believers. They must not give anyone a reason to say that they are wild and don’t obey. "},{"num":7,"verse":"A church leader takes care of God’s family. That’s why he must be without blame. He must not look after only his own interests. He must not get angry easily.
