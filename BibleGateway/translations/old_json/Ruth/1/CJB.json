"},{"num":4,"verse":"They took wives for themselves from the women of Mo’av; the name of the one was ‘Orpah; and the name of the other was Rut. They lived there for about ten years. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Then Machlon and Kilyon died, both of them; and the woman was left with neither her two sons nor her husband."},{"num":6,"verse":"So she prepared to return with her daughters-in-law from the plain of Mo’av; for in the plain of Mo’av she had heard how Adonai had paid attention to his people by giving them food.
