Then only she was left, along with her two sons."},{"num":4,"verse":"They took wives for themselves, Moabite women; the name of the first was Orpah and the name of the second was Ruth. And they lived there for about ten years."},{"num":5,"verse":"But both of the sons, Mahlon and Chilion, also died. Only the woman was left, without her two children and without her husband."},{"num":6,"verse":"Then she arose along with her daughters-in-law to return from the field of Moab, because while in the territory of Moab she had heard that the Lord had paid attention to his people by providing food for them."},{"num":7,"verse":"She left the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law went with her.

May the Lord deal faithfully with you, just as you have done with the dead and with me."},{"num":9,"verse":"May the Lord provide for you so that you may find security, each woman in the household of her husband.” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept."},{"num":10,"verse":"But they replied to her, “No, instead we will return with you, to your people.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Naomi replied, “Turn back, my daughters.

If I were to say that I have hope, even if I had a husband tonight, and even more, if I were to bear sons—"},{"num":13,"verse":"would you wait until they grew up? Would you refrain from having a husband? No, my daughters.
