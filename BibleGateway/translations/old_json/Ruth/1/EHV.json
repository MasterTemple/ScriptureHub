[{"header":"Ruth and Naomi Come to Bethlehem"},{"num":1,"verse":"During the days of the judges, a famine occurred in the land.

They entered the territory of Moab and remained there."},{"num":3,"verse":"But Elimelek, Naomi’s husband, died, so she was left with her two sons. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They then married Moabite wives. The name of the first was Orpah, and the name of the second was Ruth. They lived there for about ten years. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But Naomi’s sons, Mahlon and Kilion, also died. So the woman was left without her two children and without her husband."},{"num":6,"verse":"Then Naomi set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the territory of Moab, because while she was in the territory of Moab, she had heard that the Lord had graciously visited his people by providing them with food.

They set out on the road to return to the land of Judah."},{"num":8,"verse":"But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back. Both of you return to your mother’s house.

Why should you go with me? Am I going to give birth to any more sons who could become your husbands? "},{"num":12,"verse":"Turn back, my daughters. Go! For I am too old to be married to another husband. Suppose I say, ‘I have hope, and I will be married to another husband tonight, and I will even give birth to sons.’ "},{"num":13,"verse":"Would you wait for them until they grow up? On the basis of that hope would you give up the chance to marry another husband? No, my daughters.

When they entered Bethlehem, it was the beginning of the barley harvest."}]
