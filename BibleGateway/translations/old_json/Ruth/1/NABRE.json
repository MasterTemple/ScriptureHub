Some time after their arrival on the plateau of Moab, "},{"num":3,"verse":"Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They married Moabite women, one named Orpah, the other Ruth. When they had lived there about ten years, "},{"num":5,"verse":"both Mahlon and Chilion died also, and the woman was left with neither her two boys nor her husband."},{"num":6,"verse":"She and her daughters-in-law then prepared to go back from the plateau of Moab because word had reached her there that the Lord had seen to his people’s needs and given them food. "},{"num":7,"verse":"She and her two daughters-in-law left the place where they had been living. On the road back to the land of Judah, "},{"num":8,"verse":"Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you to your mother’s house. May the Lord show you the same kindness as you have shown to the deceased and to me.
