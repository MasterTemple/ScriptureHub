[{"header":"Ruth Meets Boaz"},{"num":2,"verse":"Now Naomi had a relative of her husband, a wealthy, generous man from the clan of Elimelek. His name was Boaz."},{"num":2,"verse":"Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “I am going to go out to the fields, so that I can glean ears of grain wherever I may find favor in the eyes of the owner.” Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"So Ruth went out and gleaned in the grain fields after the reapers. It happened that she was in the field that belonged to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek. "},{"num":4,"verse":"At just that time, Boaz happened to come out from Bethlehem. He said to the reapers, “The Lord be with you!”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Then Boaz asked his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?”"},{"num":6,"verse":"The servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, “She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the territory of Moab. "},{"num":7,"verse":"She said, ‘Please let me follow the reapers and glean and gather stalks into sheaves.’ So she came and has been working from early morning till now—except for a short rest in the shelter.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go off to glean in some other field. In fact, do not leave this one at all! Just stick close to my young women here. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Keep your eyes on the field where the men are reaping so that you can follow my women. I have commanded the young men not to touch you. When you are thirsty, you may go to the jars and drink from whatever the young men draw out.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Then Ruth bowed down with her face to the ground. She said to Boaz, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, so that you acknowledge me even though I am a foreigner?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Boaz replied to her, “I have been fully informed about all that you did for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband and how you left behind your father and mother and the homeland of your relatives, and you came to a people whom you did not know previously.

You are not to humiliate her in any way.
