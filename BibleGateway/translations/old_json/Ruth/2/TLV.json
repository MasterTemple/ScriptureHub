"},{"num":7,"verse":"“She asked ‘Please allow me to glean and gather among the barley sheaves behind the harvesters.’ So she came and has been working in the field since morning until now, except for a little while in the shelter.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen to me, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field or even pass on from here, but stay close to my female workers. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Keep your eyes on the field that they are harvesting, and follow after them. I strongly ordered the young men not to touch you.

Meanwhile she lived with her mother-in-law."}]
