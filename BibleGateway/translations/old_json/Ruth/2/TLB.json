Stay right behind my women workers; I have warned the young men not to bother you; when you are thirsty, go and help yourself to the water.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"She thanked him warmly. “How can you be so kind to me?” she asked. “You must know I am only a foreigner.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"May the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge, bless you for it.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"“Oh, thank you, sir,” she replied. “You are so good to me, and I’m not even one of your workers!”"},{"num":14,"verse":"At lunchtime Boaz called to her, “Come and eat with us.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"And when she went back to work again, Boaz told his young men to let her glean right among the sheaves without stopping her, "},{"num":16,"verse":"and to snap off some heads of barley and drop them on purpose for her to glean, and not to make any remarks.
