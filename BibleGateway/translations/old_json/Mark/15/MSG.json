That’s quite a list of accusations.” Still, he said nothing. Pilate was impressed, really impressed."},{"num":6,"verse":"It was a custom at the Feast to release a prisoner, anyone the people asked for. There was one prisoner called Barabbas, locked up with the insurrectionists who had committed murder during the uprising against Rome. As the crowd came up and began to present its petition for him to release a prisoner, Pilate anticipated them: “Do you want me to release the King of the Jews to you?” Pilate knew by this time that it was through sheer spite that the high priests had turned Jesus over to him."},{"num":11,"verse":"But the high priests by then had worked up the crowd to ask for the release of Barabbas. Pilate came back, “So what do I do with this man you call King of the Jews?”"},{"num":13,"verse":"They yelled, “Nail him to a cross!”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Pilate objected, “But for what crime?”"},{"num":15,"verse":"Pilate gave the crowd what it wanted, set Barabbas free and turned Jesus over for whipping and crucifixion."},{"num":16,"verse":"The soldiers took Jesus into the palace (called Praetorium) and called together the entire brigade. They dressed him up in purple and put a crown plaited from a thornbush on his head. Then they began their mockery: “Bravo, King of the Jews!” They banged on his head with a club, spit on him, and knelt down in mock worship.

And they nailed him to the cross. They divided up his clothes and threw dice to see who would get them."},{"num":25,"verse":"They nailed him up at nine o’clock in the morning. The charge against him—the king of the jews—was scrawled across a sign. Along with him, they crucified two criminals, one to his right, the other to his left. People passing along the road jeered, shaking their heads in mock lament: “You bragged that you could tear down the Temple and then rebuild it in three days—so show us your stuff! Save yourself! If you’re really God’s Son, come down from that cross!”"},{"num":31,"verse":"The high priests, along with the religion scholars, were right there mixing it up with the rest of them, having a great time poking fun at him: “He saved others—but he can’t save himself!

We’ll all become believers then!” Even the men crucified alongside him joined in the mockery."},{"num":33,"verse":"At noon the sky became extremely dark. The darkness lasted three hours.

He was one who lived expectantly, on the lookout for the kingdom of God. Working up his courage, he went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body.
