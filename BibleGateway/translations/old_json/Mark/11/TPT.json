"},{"num":16,"verse":"And he would not allow them to use the temple courts as a thoroughfare for carrying their merchandise and their furniture."},{"num":17,"verse":"Then he began to teach the people, saying, “Does not the Scripture say, ‘My house will be a house of prayer for all the world to share’?
