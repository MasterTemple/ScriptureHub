"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then they saw Eliyahu and Moshe speaking with Yeshua. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Kefa said to Yeshua, “It’s good that we’re here, Rabbi! Let’s put up three shelters — one for you, one for Moshe and one for Eliyahu.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"(He didn’t know what to say, they were so frightened.)

I asked your talmidim to drive the spirit out, but they couldn’t do it.” "},{"num":19,"verse":"“People without any trust!” he responded. “How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you?
