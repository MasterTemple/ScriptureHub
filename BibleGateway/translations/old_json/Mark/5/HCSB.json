"},{"num":5,"verse":"And always, night and day, he was crying out among the tombs and in the mountains and cutting himself with stones."},{"num":6,"verse":"When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before Him. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And he cried out with a loud voice, “What do You have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You before God, don’t torment me!” "},{"num":8,"verse":"For He had told him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”"},{"num":10,"verse":"And he kept begging Him not to send them out of the region."},{"num":11,"verse":"Now a large herd of pigs was there, feeding on the hillside.
