[{"header":"The Parable of the Sower"},{"num":4,"verse":"Again he began to teach by the lake. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while the whole crowd was on the shore by the lake. "},{"num":2,"verse":"He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching said to them: "},{"num":3,"verse":"“Listen! A sower went out to sow. "},{"num":4,"verse":"And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have sufficient root, it withered. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked it, and it did not produce grain. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But other seed fell on good soil and produced grain, sprouting and growing; some yielded thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear had better listen!”"},{"header":"The Purpose of Parables"},{"num":10,"verse":"When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. "},{"num":11,"verse":"He said to them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables,"},{"num":13,"verse":"He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? Then how will you understand any parable? "},{"num":14,"verse":"The sower sows the word. "},{"num":15,"verse":"These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: Whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and snatches the word that was sown in them. "},{"num":16,"verse":"These are the ones sown on rocky ground: As soon as they hear the word, they receive it with joy. "},{"num":17,"verse":"But they have no root in themselves and do not endure. Then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Others are the ones sown among thorns: They are those who hear the word, "},{"num":19,"verse":"but worldly cares, the seductiveness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it produces nothing. "},{"num":20,"verse":"But these are the ones sown on good soil: They hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, one thirty times as much, one sixty, and one a hundred.”"},{"header":"The Parable of the Lamp"},{"num":21,"verse":"He also said to them, “A lamp isn’t brought to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Isn’t it to be placed on a lampstand? "},{"num":22,"verse":"For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, and nothing concealed except to be brought to light. "},{"num":23,"verse":"If anyone has ears to hear, he had better listen!” "},{"num":24,"verse":"And he said to them, “Take care about what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you receive, and more will be added to you.

"},{"num":27,"verse":"He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. "},{"num":28,"verse":"By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. "},{"num":29,"verse":"And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.”"},{"header":"The Parable of the Mustard Seed"},{"num":30,"verse":"He also asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it? "},{"num":31,"verse":"It is like a mustard seed that when sown in the ground, even though it is the smallest of all the seeds in the ground—"},{"num":32,"verse":"when it is sown, it grows up, becomes the greatest of all garden plants, and grows large branches so that the wild birds can nest in its shade.”"},{"header":"The Use of Parables"},{"num":33,"verse":"So with many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear. "},{"num":34,"verse":"He did not speak to them without a parable.

"},{"num":37,"verse":"Now a great windstorm developed and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was nearly swamped. "},{"num":38,"verse":"But he was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to die?” "},{"num":39,"verse":"So he got up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Calm down!” Then the wind stopped, and it was dead calm. "},{"num":40,"verse":"And he said to them, “Why are you cowardly? Do you still not have faith?” "},{"num":41,"verse":"They were overwhelmed by fear and said to one another, “Who then is this? Even the wind and sea obey him!”"}]
