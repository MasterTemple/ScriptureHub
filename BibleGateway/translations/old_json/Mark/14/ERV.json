They said, “Why waste that perfume?"},{"num":5,"verse":"It was worth a full year’s pay. It could have been sold and the money given to those who are poor.” And they told the woman what a bad thing she had done."},{"num":6,"verse":"Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why are you giving her such trouble? She did a very good thing for me."},{"num":7,"verse":"You will always have the poor with you, and you can help them any time you want.
