She broke open the jar and poured the perfume over his head."},{"num":4,"verse":"Some of those at the table were indignant. “Why waste such expensive perfume?” they asked."},{"num":5,"verse":"“It could have been sold for a year’s wages and the money given to the poor!” So they scolded her harshly."},{"num":6,"verse":"But Jesus replied, “Leave her alone. Why criticize her for doing such a good thing to me?"},{"num":7,"verse":"You will always have the poor among you, and you can help them whenever you want to.
