[{"num":14,"verse":"And two days before the Feast of the Passover, and of Unleavened Bread, the chief priests and scribes sought how they might take Jesus secretly, and put Him to death."},{"num":2,"verse":"“But,” they said, “Not on the feast day, or else there may be unrest among the people.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"And when He was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at table, there came a woman with a box of ointment (of spikenard, very costly). And she broke the box and poured it on His head."},{"num":4,"verse":"Therefore some whispered angrily among themselves, and said, “To what end is this waste of ointment?"},{"num":5,"verse":"“For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denari, and the money given to the poor.” And they murmured against her."},{"num":6,"verse":"But Jesus said, “Let her alone. Why do you trouble yourselves with her? She has done a good work for Me."},{"num":7,"verse":"“For you have the poor with you always. And when you will you may do them good.

And when He had given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them and said, “Take. Eat. This is My body.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"Also, He took the cup. And when He had given thanks, He gave it to them.

All things are possible for You. Take away this cup from Me. Nevertheless, not that I will, but that You will, be done.”"},{"num":37,"verse":"Then He came, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “Simon! Asleep? Could you not watch one hour!?"},{"num":38,"verse":"“Watch. And pray. So that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is ready, but the flesh is weak.”"},{"num":39,"verse":"And again He went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words."},{"num":40,"verse":"And He returned and found them asleep again.

Why should these bear witness against You?”"},{"num":61,"verse":"But He kept silent and answered nothing. Again, the High Priest asked Him and said to Him, “Are you the Christ; the Son of the Blessed?”"},{"num":62,"verse":"And Jesus said, “I am He. And you shall see the Son of Man sit at the right hand of power, coming in the clouds of Heaven.”"},{"num":63,"verse":"Then the High Priest tore his clothes, and said, “What have we anymore need of witnesses?!"},{"num":64,"verse":"You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think!?” And they all condemned Him to be worthy of death."},{"num":65,"verse":"And some began to spit at Him, and to cover His face, and to beat Him with fists, and to say to Him, “Prophesy!” And the sergeants slapped Him."},{"num":66,"verse":"And as Peter was beneath in the hall, one of the maids of the High Priest came."},{"num":67,"verse":"And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with Jesus of Nazareth.”"},{"num":68,"verse":"But he denied it, saying, “I do not know Him. Nor do I understand what you say.” Then he went out onto the porch. And the cock crew."},{"num":69,"verse":"Then another maid saw him and began to say to those who stood by, “This is one of them.”"},{"num":70,"verse":"But he denied it again.
