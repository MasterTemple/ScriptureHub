[{"header":"The Story of the Evil Farmers(A)"},{"num":12,"verse":"[Then] Jesus began ·to use stories to teach the people [to speak to them in parables; see 3:23]. He said, “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it and dug a ·hole [vat; pit] for a winepress and built a tower [to protect against thieves; see Is. 5:1–7 for the background to this parable]. Then he leased the land to some [tenant] farmers and left for a trip [the owner represents God, the farmers are Israel’s religious leaders].

Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"So they took the son, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard."},{"num":9,"verse":"“So what will the ·owner [lord] of the vineyard do? He will come and ·kill [destroy] those farmers and will give the vineyard to ·other farmers [others; referring to the sinners who were responding to Jesus’ call for repentance, and eventually to the Gentiles who would be saved].

So they ·wanted to find a way [were seeking/trying] to arrest Jesus, but they were afraid of the people. So the leaders left him and went away."},{"header":"Is It Right to Pay Taxes or Not?(B)"},{"num":13,"verse":"Later, the Jewish leaders sent some Pharisees and Herodians [a political group that supported king Herod and his family; 3:6] to Jesus to ·trap [catch] him in saying something wrong.

You are not ·afraid of [concerned about] what other people think about you, because you ·pay no attention to who they are [play no favorites; are impartial; aren’t swayed by appearances].
