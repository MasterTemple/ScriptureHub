"},{"num":11,"verse":"This is the Lord’s doing and it is an amazing thing to see.’”"},{"num":12,"verse":"The Jewish leaders wanted to arrest him then and there for using this illustration, for they knew he was pointing at them—they were the wicked farmers in his story.

Here was their question:"},{"num":19,"verse":"“Teacher, Moses gave us a law that when a man dies without children, the man’s brother should marry his widow and have children in his brother’s name. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Well, there were seven brothers and the oldest married and died, and left no children. So the second brother married the widow, but soon he died too and left no children. Then the next brother married her and died without children, and so on until all were dead, and still there were no children; and last of all, the woman died too."},{"num":23,"verse":"“What we want to know is this: In the resurrection, whose wife will she be, for she had been the wife of each of them?”"},{"num":24,"verse":"Jesus replied, “Your trouble is that you don’t know the Scriptures and don’t know the power of God.
