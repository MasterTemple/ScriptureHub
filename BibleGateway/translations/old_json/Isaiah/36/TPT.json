"},{"num":2,"verse":"After defeating Lachish, Sennacherib sent his chief commander with his massive army from there to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. He took up a position on the road to the Washerman’s Field, at the end of the aqueduct where it empties into the upper pool.

"},{"num":5,"verse":"You think you have a strategy and defensive might, but mere words are no match for my army! In whom are you trusting for help that you rebel against me? "},{"num":6,"verse":"I know—you are relying on Egypt, that broken staff full of splinters. If anyone leans on it, it will pierce his hand. Pharaoh himself, king of Egypt, is like that splintered staff to those who put their trust in him! But you tell me that you are trusting in Yahweh, your God. For Hezekiah went around destroying every sacred altar from the land. Didn’t he insist that Judah and Jerusalem had to worship only at this altar in your temple?
