[{"num":61,"verse":"¶ The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me because the LORD has anointed me; he has sent me to preach good tidings unto those who are cast down; to bind up the wounds of the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those that are bound;"},{"num":2,"verse":"to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favour, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;"},{"num":3,"verse":"to order in Zion those that mourn, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified."},{"num":4,"verse":"¶ And they shall build the old wastes; they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall restore the waste cities, the desolations of many generations."},{"num":5,"verse":"And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers."},{"num":6,"verse":"But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD; men shall call you the Ministers of our God; ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and with their glory ye shall be lifted up."},{"num":7,"verse":"Instead of your double shame, and your dishonour, they shall praise you in your inheritance; therefore in your land ye shall possess double, and ye shall have everlasting joy."},{"num":8,"verse":"For I the LORD love that which is right, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will confirm your work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them."},{"num":9,"verse":"And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles and their offspring among the peoples; all that saw them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which the LORD has blessed."},{"num":10,"verse":"¶ I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of saving health; he has surrounded me with the robe of righteousness; as a bridegroom he has arrayed me, and as a bride made up of his jewels."},{"num":11,"verse":"For as the earth brings forth her shoot and as the garden causes her seed to spring forth so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the Gentiles."}]
