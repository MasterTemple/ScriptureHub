[{"num":31,"verse":"¶ Woe to those that go down to Egypt for help; and trust in horses and place their hope in chariots because they are many and in horsemen, because they are valiant, but they did not look unto the Holy One of Israel, neither did they seek the LORD!"},{"num":2,"verse":"Yet he also is wise to guide evil and will not cause his words to lie but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of those that work iniquity."},{"num":3,"verse":"Now the Egyptian is a man, and not God, and his horses flesh, and not spirit, so that as the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helps shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they shall all fail together."},{"num":4,"verse":"For thus has the LORD spoken unto me, Like the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, even if a multitude of shepherds come forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voices, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of the hosts come down to fight for Mount Zion and for his hill."},{"num":5,"verse":"As birds flying, so will the LORD of the hosts defend Jerusalem; defending, delivering, passing over, and saving it."},{"num":6,"verse":"¶ Turn ye unto him against whom ye have deeply revolted, O sons of Israel."},{"num":7,"verse":"For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you as a sin."},{"num":8,"verse":"Then the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the presence of the sword, and his young men shall faint."},{"num":9,"verse":"And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the banner, saith the LORD, unto whom there is fire in Zion, and unto whom there is a furnace in Jerusalem."}]
