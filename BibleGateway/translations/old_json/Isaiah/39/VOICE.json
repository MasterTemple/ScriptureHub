"},{"num":2,"verse":"Hezekiah was delighted at the kind gesture from so great a king, so he welcomed his guests and showed them the best of Judah’s treasures and talents—silver and gold, precious spices, and oils that wafted the smells of paradise. He gave them a tour of his armory and showed them all of Judah’s military equipment and everything they’d stashed away for future need. Hezekiah held nothing back from their appreciative eyes. He showed them everything in his house and his kingdom."},{"num":3,"verse":"When Isaiah the prophet heard about Hezekiah’s tour, he hurried to the palace and confronted Hezekiah."}]
