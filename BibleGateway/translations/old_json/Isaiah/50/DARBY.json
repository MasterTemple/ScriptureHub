[{"num":50,"verse":"Thus saith Jehovah: Where is the bill of your mother's divorce, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, through your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away."},{"num":2,"verse":"Wherefore did I come, and there was no man? I called, and there was none to answer? Is my hand at all shortened that I cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make rivers a wilderness; their fish stink because there is no water, and die for thirst."},{"num":3,"verse":"I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering."},{"num":4,"verse":"The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the instructed, that I should know how to succour by a word him that is weary.

Behold, they all shall grow old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up."},{"num":10,"verse":"Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that hearkeneth to the voice of his servant? he that walketh in darkness, and hath no light,â€”let him confide in the name of Jehovah, and stay himself upon his God."},{"num":11,"verse":"Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and among the sparks [that] ye have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand: ye shall lie down in sorrow."}]
