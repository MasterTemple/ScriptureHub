There is no other Rock!"},{"num":9,"verse":"What fools they are who manufacture idols for their gods. Their hopes remain unanswered. They themselves are witnesses that this is so, for their idols neither see nor know. No wonder those who worship them are so ashamed.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"Then the wood-carver takes the ax and uses it to make an idol. He measures and marks out a block of wood and carves the figure of a man. Now he has a wonderful idol that can’t so much as move from where it is placed.

"},{"num":15,"verse":"And after his care, he uses part of the wood to make a fire to warm himself and bake his bread, and then—he really does—he takes the rest of it and makes himself a god—a god for men to worship! An idol to fall down before and praise! "},{"num":16,"verse":"Part of the tree he burns to roast his meat and to keep him warm and fed and well content, "},{"num":17,"verse":"and with what’s left he makes his god: a carved idol! He falls down before it and worships it and prays to it. “Deliver me,” he says. “You are my god!”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Such stupidity and ignorance! God has shut their eyes so that they cannot see and closed their minds from understanding. "},{"num":19,"verse":"The man never stops to think or figure out, “Why, it’s just a block of wood! I’ve burned it for heat and used it to bake my bread and roast my meat. How can the rest of it be a god?

By myself I made the earth and everything in it."},{"num":25,"verse":"I am the one who shows what liars all false prophets are, by causing something else to happen than the things they say. I make wise men give opposite advice to what they should and make them into fools. "},{"num":26,"verse":"But what my prophets say, I do; when they say Jerusalem will be delivered and the cities of Judah lived in once again—it shall be done!
