The lamb was like a daughter to him."},{"num":4,"verse":"“Then a traveler stopped to visit the rich man. The rich man wanted to feed the traveler, but he ·didn’t want [was unwilling/loath] to take one ·of his own sheep or cattle [from his own flock or herd]. Instead, he took the lamb from the poor man and ·cooked [prepared] it for his visitor.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"David ·became very angry at [burned with anger against] the rich man.

"},{"num":10,"verse":"·Now [Therefore] ·there will always be people in your family who will die by a sword [the sword will never depart from your house], because you ·did not respect [have despised] me; you took the wife of Uriah the Hittite for yourself!’"},{"num":11,"verse":"“This is what the Lord says: ‘I am ·bringing trouble to [raising up evil against] you from your own ·family [house]. ·While you watch [Before your eyes], I will take your wives from you and give them to ·someone who is very close to you [your neighbor].

David’s ·servants [advisers] were afraid to tell him that the baby was dead. They said, “Look, we tried to talk to David while the baby was alive, but he refused to listen to ·us [reason].
