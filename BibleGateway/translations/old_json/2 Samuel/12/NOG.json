[{"header":"Nathan Confronts David"},{"num":12,"verse":"So Yahweh sent Nathan to David. Nathan came to him and said, “There were two men in a certain city. One was rich, and the other was poor. "},{"num":2,"verse":"The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cows, "},{"num":3,"verse":"but the poor man had only one little female lamb that he had bought. He raised her, and she grew up in his home with his children. She would eat his food and drink from his cup. She rested in his arms and was like a daughter."},{"num":4,"verse":"“Now, a visitor came to the rich man. The rich man thought it would be a pity to take one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler. So he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared her for the traveler.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"David burned with anger against the man. “I solemnly swear, as Yahweh lives,” he said to Nathan, “the man who did this certainly deserves to die! "},{"num":6,"verse":"And he must pay back four times the price of the lamb because he did this and had no pity.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"“You are the man!” Nathan told David. “This is what Yahweh Elohim of Israel says: I anointed you king over Israel and rescued you from Saul. "},{"num":8,"verse":"I gave you your master Saul’s house and his wives. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if this weren’t enough, I would have given you even more. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Why did you despise my word by doing what I considered evil? You had Uriah the Hittite killed in battle. You took his wife as your wife. You used the Ammonites to kill him. "},{"num":10,"verse":"So warfare will never leave your house because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife."},{"num":11,"verse":"“This is what Yahweh says: I will stir up trouble against you within your own household, and before your own eyes I will take your wives and give them to someone close to you.

He may harm himself.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"But when David saw that his officials were whispering to one another, he realized that the child was dead. “Is the child dead?” David asked them."},{"num":20,"verse":"So David got up from the ground, bathed, anointed himself, and changed his clothes. He went into Yahweh’s house and worshiped. Then he went home and asked for food. They placed food in front of him, and he ate."},{"num":21,"verse":"His officials asked him, “Why are you acting this way? You fasted and cried over the child when he was alive. But as soon as the child died, you got up and ate.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"David answered, “As long as the child was alive, I fasted and cried. I thought, ‘Who knows? Yahweh may be gracious to me and let the child live.’ "},{"num":23,"verse":"But why should I fast now that he’s dead? Can I bring him back? Someday I’ll go to him, but he won’t come back to me.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went to bed with her, and she later gave birth to a son. David named him Solomon. Yahweh loved the child "},{"num":25,"verse":"and sent a message through the prophet Nathan to name the baby Jedidiah [The Lord’s Beloved]."},{"header":"David Defeats the Ammonites(A)"},{"num":26,"verse":"Meanwhile, Joab fought against the Ammonite city of Rabbah and captured its royal fortress.
