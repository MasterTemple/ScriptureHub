The lamb was like a daughter to him."},{"num":4,"verse":"“Then a traveler stopped to visit the rich man.

When the baby was still alive, you fasted and you cried. Now that the baby is dead, you get up and eat food.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"David said, “While the baby was still alive, I fasted, and I cried. I thought, ‘Who knows? Maybe the Lord will feel sorry for me and let the baby live.’ "},{"num":23,"verse":"But now that the baby is dead, why should I fast? I can’t bring him back to life. Someday I will go to him, but he cannot come back to me.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife. He slept with her and had sexual relations with her.
