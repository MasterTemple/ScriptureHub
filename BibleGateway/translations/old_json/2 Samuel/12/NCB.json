One was rich and the other was poor."},{"num":2,"verse":"The rich man had flocks and herds in great abundance,"},{"num":3,"verse":"but the poor man had nothing at all except for one little ewe lamb which he had bought. He cared for it, and the lamb grew up with him and with his children. It would share the little food he had and drink from his cup and sleep in his arms. It was like a daughter to him."},{"num":4,"verse":"“On one occasion the rich man welcomed a traveler into his house, but he had no wish to take one animal from his flock or herd to provide a meal for his guest. Instead he took the poor man’s ewe lamb and prepared that for his visitor.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"On hearing this, David flew into a rage against that man, and he said to Nathan: “As the Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die."},{"num":6,"verse":"He must make fourfold restitution for the lamb, because he has done this without showing the least bit of pity.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"David’s Punishment. Then Nathan said to David: “You are that man! Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘I anointed you king of Israel, and I rescued you from the clutches of Saul."},{"num":8,"verse":"I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives as your own. I also gave you the house of Israel and the house of Judah. And if that had not been sufficient, I would have given you even more."},{"num":9,"verse":"“ ‘Why have you shown your lack of gratitude to the Lord by doing what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and taken his wife to be your own after having killed him with the sword of the Ammonites."},{"num":10,"verse":"Now, therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, since you have shown contempt for me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’"},{"num":11,"verse":"“Thus says the Lord: ‘I will bring misfortune upon you from within your own house.

David said to Nathan: “I have sinned against the Lord.” Nathan replied to David: “The Lord has decided to forgive your sin.

However, he refused to do so, nor would he take food with them."},{"num":18,"verse":"On the seventh day the child died, and the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said: “While the child was alive, we spoke to him, but he refused to listen to us. How then can we inform him that the child is dead? He may do something desperate.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"However, David saw that his servants were whispering among themselves, and he realized that the child had died. He asked the servants: “Is the child dead?” They replied: “Yes, the child is dead.”"},{"num":20,"verse":"David, thereupon, rose from the ground, bathed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes. He then went into the house of the Lord and worshiped before he returned to his own house. When he requested food, they set it before him, and he ate."},{"num":21,"verse":"His servants said to him: “Why are you acting in this way? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive, but when the child died, you got up and ate food.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"David said: “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I thought: ‘Perhaps the Lord will be merciful to me and allow the child to live.’"},{"num":23,"verse":"But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"David then proceeded to console his wife Bathsheba. He went to her and slept with her.
