[{"header":"Sheba Urges Israel Not to Follow David"},{"num":20,"verse":"An evil man who always stirred up trouble happened to be in Gilgal. His name was Sheba, the son of Bikri. Sheba was from the tribe of Benjamin. He blew his trumpet. Then he shouted,"},{"num":2,"verse":"So all the men of Israel deserted David. They followed Sheba, the son of Bikri. But the men of Judah stayed with their king. They remained with him from the Jordan River all the way to Jerusalem."},{"num":3,"verse":"David returned to his palace in Jerusalem. He had left ten concubines there to take care of the palace. He put them in a house and kept them under guard. He gave them what they needed. But he didn’t sleep with them. They were kept under guard until the day they died. They lived as if they were widows."},{"num":4,"verse":"The king said to Amasa, “Send for the men of Judah. Tell them to come to me within three days. And be here yourself.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"So Amasa went to get the men of Judah. But he took longer than the time the king had set for him."},{"num":6,"verse":"David said to Abishai, “Sheba, the son of Bikri, will do more harm to us than Absalom ever did.

They went after Sheba, the son of Bikri."},{"num":14,"verse":"Sheba passed through all the territory of the tribes of Israel. He arrived at the city of Abel Beth Maakah. He had gone through the entire area of the Bikrites. They had gathered together and followed him. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Joab and all his troops came to Abel Beth Maakah. They surrounded it because Sheba was there. They built a ramp up to the city. It stood against the outer wall. They pounded the wall with huge logs to bring it down.

"},{"num":21,"verse":"That isn’t what I have in mind at all. There’s a man named Sheba, the son of Bikri, in your city. He’s from the hill country of Ephraim. He’s trying to kill King David. Hand that man over to me. Then I’ll pull my men back from your city.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Then the woman gave her wise advice to all the people in the city. They cut off the head of Sheba, the son of Bikri. They threw it down to Joab. So he blew his trumpet. Then his men pulled back from the city. Each of them returned to his home. And Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem."},{"header":"David’s Officials"}]
