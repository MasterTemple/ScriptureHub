[{"num":14,"verse":"Yo’av the son of Tz’ruyah perceived that the king missed Avshalom; "},{"num":2,"verse":"so Yo’av sent to T’koa, brought from there a clever woman and said to her, “Please, pretend you’re a mourner. Put on mourning clothes, and don’t anoint yourself with oil, but appear to be a woman who has mourned for the dead a long time. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Go in to the king and speak to him in this fashion — ” and then Yo’av told her just what to say. "},{"num":4,"verse":"When the woman of T’koa spoke to the king, she fell down with her face to the ground, prostrating herself, and said, “King, help!” "},{"num":5,"verse":"The king said to her, “What’s the trouble?” She answered, “I’m a widow.
