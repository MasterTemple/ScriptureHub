I will kill only the king "},{"num":3,"verse":"and will bring the entire army back to you. In exchange for the life of the man you are seeking, you will get back everyone. The entire army will return unharmed.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"This seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all the leaders of Israel. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But Absalom said, “Call for Hushai the Arkite, and let’s hear what he has to say.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"So Hushai came to Absalom. Absalom said to him, “Here is what Ahithophel has advised. Should we follow his advice? If not, what would you recommend?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Hushai replied to Absalom, “Ahithophel’s advice is not sound this time.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Hushai went on to say, “You know your father and his men—they are soldiers and are as dangerous as a bear out in the wild that has been robbed of her cubs.

If it should turn out that he attacks our troops first, whoever hears about it will say, ‘Absalom’s army has been slaughtered!’ "},{"num":10,"verse":"If that happens even the bravest soldier—one who is lion-hearted—will virtually melt away.
