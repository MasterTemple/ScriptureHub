Then I will attack the king alone, "},{"num":3,"verse":"and I will bring all the people [who follow David] back to you. The return of everyone depends on the [death of the] man you are seeking; then all the people will be at peace [and accept you as king].” "},{"num":4,"verse":"So the plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel."},{"num":5,"verse":"Nevertheless, Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Ahithophel has advised this [plan of action].
