And the king said to the men, “I myself will certainly go out [to fight] with you.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"But the men said, “You should not go out [to battle with us]. For if in fact we retreat, they will not care about us; even if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. So now it is better that you be ready to help us from the city [of Mahanaim].” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the king said to them, “I will do whatever seems best to you.” So the king stood beside the gate [of Mahanaim], and all the army went out in groups of hundreds and of thousands.

Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.” "},{"num":12,"verse":"The man told Joab, “Even if I were to feel the weight of a thousand pieces of silver in my hands, I would not put out my hand against the king’s son; for we all heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, ‘Protect the young man Absalom, for my sake.’ "},{"num":13,"verse":"Otherwise, if I had acted treacherously against his life (for nothing is hidden from the king) you yourself would have taken sides against me.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"Joab said, “I will not waste time with you.” So he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive [and caught] in the midst of the tree.
