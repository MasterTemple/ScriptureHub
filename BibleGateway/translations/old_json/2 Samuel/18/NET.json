"},{"num":2,"verse":"David then sent out the army—a third under the leadership of Joab, a third under the leadership of Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under the leadership of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the troops, “I too will indeed march out with you.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"But the soldiers replied, “You should not do this! For if we should have to make a rapid retreat, they won’t be concerned about us. Even if half of us should die, they won’t be concerned. But you are like 10,000 of us! So it is better if you remain in the city for support.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the king said to them, “I will do whatever seems best to you.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"The king gave this order to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: “For my sake deal gently with the young man Absalom.” Now the entire army was listening when the king gave all the leaders this order concerning Absalom."},{"num":6,"verse":"Then the army marched out to the field to fight against Israel.

You saw this? Why didn’t you strike him down right on the spot? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a commemorative belt!”"},{"num":12,"verse":"The man replied to Joab, “Even if I were receiving 1,000 pieces of silver, I would not strike the king’s son! In our very presence the king gave this order to you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.’ "},{"num":13,"verse":"If I had acted at risk of my own life—and nothing is hidden from the king—you would have abandoned me.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Joab replied, “I will not wait around like this for you!” He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the middle of Absalom while he was still alive in the middle of the oak tree.

In the meantime all the Israelite soldiers fled to their homes."},{"num":18,"verse":"Before this Absalom had set up a monument and dedicated it to himself in the King’s Valley, reasoning, “I have no son who will carry on my name.” He named the monument after himself, and to this day it is known as Absalom’s Memorial."},{"header":"David Learns of Absalom’s Death"},{"num":19,"verse":"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me run and give the king the good news that the Lord has vindicated him before his enemies.” "},{"num":20,"verse":"But Joab said to him, “You will not be a bearer of good news today. You will bear good news some other day, but not today, for the king’s son is dead.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go and tell the king what you have seen.” After bowing to Joab, the Cushite ran off. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again spoke to Joab, “Whatever happens, let me go after the Cushite.” But Joab said, “Why is it that you want to go, my son? You have no good news that will bring you a reward.” "},{"num":23,"verse":"But he said, “Whatever happens, I want to go!” So Joab said to him, “Then go!” So Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Jordan plain, and he passed the Cushite."},{"num":24,"verse":"Now David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate at the wall.
