The king informed the army, “I’m going out to battle with you, too.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"“No way!” his army responded. “If we have to retreat from the battle, Absalom’s men won’t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won’t care about us. But you are worth 10,000 of us. The best thing you can do for us is to remain in the city.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"So David responded, “I’ll do what you think best.” Then he stood alongside the city gate as the army went out in battle array by hundreds and thousands.

Do it any other time, but not today, because the king’s son is dead.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"So Joab ordered a man from Ethiopia, “Go tell the king what you’ve seen.” So the Ethiopian saluted Joab and then ran to tell David."},{"num":22,"verse":"“Please,” Zadok’s son Ahimaaz continued, “No matter what happens, let me follow the Ethiopian!”"},{"num":23,"verse":"“No matter what, I’m running,” Ahimaaz replied."},{"num":24,"verse":"Meanwhile, David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the city.
