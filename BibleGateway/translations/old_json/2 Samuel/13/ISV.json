She was a virgin, and Amnon found it difficult to do anything to her."},{"num":3,"verse":"Meanwhile, Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David’s brother Shimeah. Now Jonadab was a very shrewd man. "},{"num":4,"verse":"“Why are you so depressed these past few mornings,” Jonadab asked Amnon, “since you’re a son of the king? Why not tell me?”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Jonadab advised him, “Lie down and pretend to be sick. When your father visits you, ask him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat that she prepares especially for me, and after she makes dinner for me, let her feed it to me personally.’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came to visit him, Amnon asked the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make some of her bread especially for me, so she can feed it to me personally.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"So David sent for Tamar back at the palace, telling her, “Please go to your brother Amnon’s home and prepare some food for him.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s home, where he was lying down.

Since he was stronger than she was, he forced her into having sex with him. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Afterwards, though, Amnon hated her very intensely. As a result, his hatred for her exceeded the love that he had previously for her. So Amnon told her, “Get up! Leave!”"},{"num":16,"verse":"Even so, she tried to tell him, “No! After all, it’s more wrong to send me away than what you just did to me!”"},{"num":17,"verse":"So he called out to a young man who was serving him, and told him: “Send this woman away from me and lock the door after her.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Now she was clothed in a long sleeved, multi-colored ornamental tunic, commonly worn by the king’s virgin daughters.

"},{"num":21,"verse":"When King David heard all about these developments, he flew into a rage over it. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But Absalom never said a word, either good or bad, to Amnon.

Won’t you please come and join me, along with your senior staff?”"},{"num":25,"verse":"But King David declined, saying to Absalom, “No, my son, we won’t all go, since that would be too much trouble for you.” Although Absalom begged David, he would not go, even though he did give his blessing."},{"num":26,"verse":"So Absalom responded, “If you aren’t coming, please allow my brother Amnon to accompany us.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"But Absalom kept begging David until he sent Amnon and all of David’s sons to accompany Absalom."},{"num":28,"verse":"Then Absalom instructed his young men, “Please keep watching Amnon until he’s drunk. Then I’ll tell you, ‘Attack Amnon!’ As soon as I do, kill him and don’t be afraid! You have your orders, so be strong and brave!” "},{"num":29,"verse":"So Absalom’s young men did to Amnon just as they had been ordered, but the rest of David’s sons jumped up, mounted their mules, and escaped."},{"num":30,"verse":"While they were still on the road, this rumor came to David: “Absalom has struck down all of the king’s sons and none of them has survived.” "},{"num":31,"verse":"David arose, ripped his clothes in anguish, and collapsed to the ground while all of his staff stood by with their own clothes torn."},{"num":32,"verse":"But David’s brother Shimeah’s son Jonadab reported, “Your majesty, don’t assume they’ve killed all of the young men—the king’s sons—only Amnon has died, since that was Absalom’s intention from the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.
