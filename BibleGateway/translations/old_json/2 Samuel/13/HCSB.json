"},{"num":2,"verse":"Amnon was frustrated to the point of making himself sick over his sister Tamar because she was a virgin, but it seemed impossible to do anything to her. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, a son of David’s brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very shrewd man, "},{"num":4,"verse":"and he asked Amnon, “Why are you, the king’s son, so miserable every morning? Won’t you tell me?”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend you’re sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare food in my presence so I can watch and eat from her hand.’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick.
