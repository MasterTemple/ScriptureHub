After this, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run on ahead of him."},{"num":2,"verse":"Absalom was accustomed to arise early and stand by the side of the road that led to the city gate. If someone had a lawsuit to bring before the king for judgment, Absalom would call out and ask him: “Which town do you come from?” and that person would answer: “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Then Absalom would reply: “Your petition may be clearly valid and just, but there is no one who is authorized by the king to hear you.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"He would further add: “If only I were appointed as judge in the land, then everyone who has a lawsuit or a claim to be arbitrated could come to me, and I would ensure that he would have his case judged fairly.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Moreover, whenever a man came before him and prostrated himself, Absalom would stretch out his hand, embrace him, and kiss him."},{"num":6,"verse":"By behaving in such a manner to every Israelite who approached the king to seek justice, Absalom captured the affectionate loyalty of the people."},{"num":7,"verse":"Conspiracy in Hebron. After a period of four years had elapsed, Absalom said to the king: “Please allow me to go to Hebron so that I may fulfill the vow that I have made to the Lord."},{"num":8,"verse":"For while I lived at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: ‘If the Lord ever brings me back to Jerusalem, then I shall worship the Lord in Hebron.’ ”"},{"num":9,"verse":"The king replied: “Depart in peace.” Therefore, Absalom arose and went to Hebron."},{"num":10,"verse":"Then Absalom sent messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel with this message: “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then shout: ‘Absalom has become king in Hebron.’ ”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Two hundred men had accompanied Absalom from Jerusalem. They had been invited as guests and had gone with him in complete innocence, totally unaware of what was going on."},{"num":12,"verse":"Absalom also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, who was David’s counselor, and asked him to come from his town of Giloh to join him in offering the sacrifices.

A messenger came to David with this report: “The men of Israel have transferred their allegiance to Absalom.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Upon hearing this, David said to all of his officials who were with him in Jerusalem: “Get ready to depart! If we do not flee, then none of us will be able to escape from Absalom. Depart as quickly as you can, or he will soon overtake us and inflict disaster upon us and put the city to the sword.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"The king’s officials then replied: “Whatever our lord the king decides, we are prepared to follow your commands.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"Then the king set forth, followed by his entire household, aside from ten concubines whom he left behind to take care of the palace."},{"num":17,"verse":"As the king moved on, followed by all the people, he halted at the last house, with the officials at his side."},{"num":18,"verse":"As he watched, all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all of the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath passed on before him."},{"num":19,"verse":"David and Ittai. Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite: “Why should you also come with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. For you are a foreigner, and in addition you are also an exile from your own country."},{"num":20,"verse":"You arrived only yesterday. How can I ask you to wander about with us today when truly I do not know where I am going? Go back home, therefore, and take your countrymen with you, and may the Lord grant you his kindness and his faithful love.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"However, Ittai replied to the king: “As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there your servant will also be.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"David then said to Ittai: “Go ahead, then, and march on!” Therefore, Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him."},{"num":23,"verse":"Everyone in the countryside wept aloud as the king and all the people crossed the Wadi Kidron and moved on toward the desert wilderness."},{"num":24,"verse":"David and the Priests. Zadok was also there, as well as all the Levites with him, as they carried the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark of God beside Abiathar until all those who were with them had marched out of the city."},{"num":25,"verse":"Then the king said to Zadok: “Take the Ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the Lord’s eyes, he will bring me back and permit me to see both the Ark and the place where it dwells."},{"num":26,"verse":"But if he says: ‘I am not pleased with you,’ then here I am. Let him do with me as he sees fit.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"The king also said to Zadok the priest: “Aren’t you a seer? You and Abiathar can return safely into the city with your sons, your own son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar’s son Jonathan."},{"num":28,"verse":"I shall wait at the fords of the wilderness until I receive word from you.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"Therefore, Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there."},{"num":30,"verse":"David then ascended to the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered and walking barefoot. All the people with him also covered their heads and wept as they went."},{"num":31,"verse":"When it was revealed to David that Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom, he said: “O Lord, I beg you to turn the counsel of Ahithophel into folly.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"David and Hushai. When David arrived at the summit where God was worshiped, Hushai the Archite came forth to meet him with his tunic torn and with dirt upon his head."},{"num":33,"verse":"David said to him: “If you come with me, you will only be a burden to me."},{"num":34,"verse":"However, if you return to the city and say to Absalom: ‘I will be your servant, O king. As I was formerly your father’s servant, now I will be your servant,’ you will make it possible for me to frustrate the advice of Ahithophel."},{"num":35,"verse":"“The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you there. Report to them everything that you hear in the royal palace."},{"num":36,"verse":"Their two sons are there with them: Zadok’s son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar’s son Jonathan.
