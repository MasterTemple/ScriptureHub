"},{"num":4,"verse":"I surely wish I were the judge; then anyone with a lawsuit could come to me, and I would give him justice!”"},{"num":5,"verse":"And when anyone came to bow to him, Absalom wouldn’t let him, but shook his hand instead!

"},{"num":12,"verse":"While he was offering the sacrifice, he sent for Ahithophel, one of David’s counselors who lived in Giloh. Ahithophel declared for Absalom, as did more and more others.
