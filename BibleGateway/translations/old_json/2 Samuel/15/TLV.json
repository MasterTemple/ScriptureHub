"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Absalom kept doing this to everyone of Israel who came to the king for judgment. Thus Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel."},{"num":7,"verse":"At the end of 40 years Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go to Hebron and pay my vow which I have vowed to Adonai. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For your servant vowed a vow while I was still living at Geshur in Aram saying, ‘If Adonai will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve Adonai.’”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So the king said to him, “Go in shalom.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"But Absalom sent spies to all the tribes of Israel to say, “As soon as you hear the sound of the shofar, then you are to say, ‘Absalom has become king in Hebron!’” "},{"num":11,"verse":"Now 200 men from Jerusalem went with Absalom, who were invited and were going innocently, knowing nothing of the situation.

If I find favor in Adonai’s eyes, He will bring me back, and let me see it and His dwelling.
