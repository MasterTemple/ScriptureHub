"},{"num":2,"verse":"Absalom would get up early and stand near the city gate [the hub of the town for judicial, business, and social interaction]. Anyone who had a ·problem [suit; petition; case] for the king to ·settle [judge] would come here. When someone came, Absalom would call out and say, “What city are you from?”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Then Absalom would say, “Look, your claims are ·right [sound/valid and just], but the king has no ·one [representative; deputy] to listen to you.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Absalom would also say, “I wish someone would ·make [appoint] me judge in this land! Then people with ·problems [any suit/complaint/case or cause] could come to me, and I ·could help them get [would give them] justice.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"People would come near Absalom to ·bow to [prostrate themselves before] him.

They told the people, “When you hear the trumpets, say this: ‘Absalom is the king ·at [in] Hebron!’”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Absalom ·had invited [took] two hundred men to go with him. So they went from Jerusalem with him [innocently], ·but they didn’t know [not knowing] what he was planning. "},{"num":12,"verse":"While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel, ·one of the people who advised David [David’s counselor], to come from his hometown of Giloh. So ·Absalom’s plans were working very well [the conspiracy grew stronger]. More and more people began to support him."},{"num":13,"verse":"A messenger came to David, saying, “The ·Israelites are giving their loyalty to [hearts of the people/Israelites are with] Absalom.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Then David said to all his ·officers [officials; servants] who were with him in Jerusalem, “We must ·leave [flee] quickly! If we don’t, we won’t be able to ·get away from [escape] Absalom.

"},{"num":23,"verse":"All the people ·cried loudly [wept out loud] as ·everyone [the people] passed by. King David crossed the Kidron Valley, and then all the people went on to the ·desert [wilderness]. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Zadok and all the Levites with him carried the Ark of the ·Agreement with God [Covenant/Treaty of God].
