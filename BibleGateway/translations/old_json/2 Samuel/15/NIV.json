Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, “What town are you from?” He would answer, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"And Absalom would add, “If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that they receive justice.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him."},{"num":6,"verse":"Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the people of Israel."},{"num":7,"verse":"At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, “Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the Lord."},{"num":8,"verse":"While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: ‘If the Lord takes me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the Lord in Hebron.’”"},{"num":9,"verse":"The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he went to Hebron."},{"num":10,"verse":"Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter."},{"num":12,"verse":"While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown.

Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland."},{"num":20,"verse":"You came only yesterday.

May the Lord show you kindness and faithfulness.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"But Ittai replied to the king, “As surely as the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"David said to Ittai, “Go ahead, march on.” So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him."},{"num":23,"verse":"The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness."},{"num":24,"verse":"Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city."},{"num":25,"verse":"Then the king said to Zadok, “Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the Lord’s eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again."},{"num":26,"verse":"But if he says, ‘I am not pleased with you,’ then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Do you understand?
