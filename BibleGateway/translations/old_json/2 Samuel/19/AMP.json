"},{"num":4,"verse":"But the king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!” "},{"num":5,"verse":"Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have put all your servants to shame who this day have saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters, and the lives of your wives and concubines. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have shown today that commanders and servants are nothing to you; for today I know that if Absalom had lived and all the rest of us had died today, then you would be pleased. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So now stand up, go out and speak kindly and encouragingly to your servants; for I swear by the Lord that if you do not go out, not a man will stay with you tonight.
