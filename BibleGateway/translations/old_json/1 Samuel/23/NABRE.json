"},{"num":3,"verse":"But David’s men said to him: “Even in Judah we have reason to fear. How much more so if we go to Keilah against the forces of the Philistines!” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Again David consulted the Lord, who answered: Go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your power. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So David went with his men to Keilah and fought against the Philistines. He drove off their cattle and inflicted a severe defeat on them, and freed the inhabitants of Keilah."},{"num":6,"verse":"Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, who had fled to David, went down with David to Keilah, taking the ephod with him."},{"num":7,"verse":"Flight from Keilah. When Saul was told that David had entered Keilah, he thought: “God has put him in my hand, for he has boxed himself in by entering a city with gates and bars.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Saul then called all the army to war, in order to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.
