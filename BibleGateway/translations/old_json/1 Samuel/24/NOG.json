Saul went into it to relieve himself while David and his men were sitting further back in the cave."},{"num":4,"verse":"David’s men told him, “Today is the day Yahweh referred to when he said, ‘I’m going to hand your enemy over to you. You will do to him whatever you think is right.’”"},{"num":5,"verse":"But afterward, David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the border of Saul’s robe.

The border of your robe is in my hand! Since I cut off the border of your robe and didn’t kill you, you should know and be able to see I mean no harm or rebellion.
