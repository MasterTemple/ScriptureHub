Saul chose three thousand of Israel, of whom two thousand remained with him in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin.

Then Saul sounded the horn throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then all Israel heard the report, “Saul has struck the garrison of the Philistines! Israel has become odious to the Philistines!” Then the army was called up to Saul in Gilgal. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The Philistines also assembled for battle against Israel, with thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and foot soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They came up and encamped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When the soldiers saw they were in danger because the army was hardpressed, they hid themselves in caves, thickets, rocks, caverns, and cisterns. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Other Hebrews crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul, however, held out in Gilgal, all his army trembling in fear behind him.

Had you kept the command the Lord your God gave you, the Lord would now establish your kingship in Israel forever; "},{"num":14,"verse":"but now your kingship shall not endure.
