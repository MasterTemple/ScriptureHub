[{"num":1,"verse":"There was a man from Ramatayim-Tzofim, in the hills of Efrayim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Yerocham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tochu, the son of Tzuf, from Efrat. "},{"num":2,"verse":"He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other P’ninah. P’ninah had children, but Hannah had no children. "},{"num":3,"verse":"This man went up from his city every year to worship and sacrifice to Adonai-Tzva’ot in Shiloh. The two sons of ‘Eli, Hofni and Pinchas, were cohanim of Adonai there."},{"num":4,"verse":"One day, when Elkanah was sacrificing, he gave a portion of the sacrifice to his wife P’ninah and portions to each of her sons and daughters; "},{"num":5,"verse":"but to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved Hannah, even though Adonai had kept her from having children. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Her rival taunted her and made her feel bad, because Adonai had kept her from having children. "},{"num":7,"verse":"He did the same every year; and each time she went up to the house of Adonai, she taunted her so much that she would cry and not eat. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why are you crying, and why aren’t you eating? Why be so sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” "},{"num":9,"verse":"So Hannah got up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. ‘Eli the cohen was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the temple of Adonai. "},{"num":10,"verse":"In deep depression she prayed to Adonai and cried. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Then she took a vow; she said, “Adonai-Tzva’ot, if you will notice how humiliated your servant is, if you will remember me and not forget your servant but will give your servant a male child, then I will give him to Adonai for as long as he lives; and no razor will ever come on his head.” "},{"num":12,"verse":"She prayed for a long time before Adonai; and as she did so, ‘Eli was watching her mouth. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Hannah was speaking in her heart — her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard — so ‘Eli thought she was drunk. "},{"num":14,"verse":"‘Eli said to her, “How long are you going to stay drunk? Stop drinking your wine!” "},{"num":15,"verse":"But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a very unhappy woman. I have not drunk either wine or other strong liquor; rather, I’ve been pouring out my soul before Adonai. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Don’t think of your servant as a worthless woman; because I have been speaking from the depth of my distress and anger.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"Then ‘Eli replied, “Go in peace. May the God of Isra’el grant what you have asked of him.” "},{"num":18,"verse":"She replied, “May your servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went on her way, and she ate, and her face was no longer sad. "},{"num":19,"verse":"They got up early in the morning and worshipped before Adonai, then returned and came to their house in Ramah."},{"num":20,"verse":"She conceived; and in due time she gave birth to a son, whom she named Sh’mu’el, “because I asked Adonai for him.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"The husband, Elkanah, went up with all his household to offer the yearly sacrifice to Adonai and fulfill his vow. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But Hannah did not go up, explaining to her husband, “Not till the child has been weaned. Then I will bring him, so that he can appear before Adonai and live there forever.” "},{"num":23,"verse":"Her husband Elkanah answered her, “Do what seems good to you; stay here until you have weaned him. Only may Adonai bring about what he said.” So the woman stayed behind and nursed the child, until she weaned him. "},{"num":24,"verse":"After weaning him, she took him up with her, along with three young bulls, a bushel of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of Adonai in Shiloh, even though he was just a child. "},{"num":25,"verse":"After the bull had been slaughtered, the child was brought to ‘Eli; "},{"num":26,"verse":"and she said, “My lord, as sure as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here near you, praying to Adonai. "},{"num":27,"verse":"I prayed for this child, and Adonai has granted the request I asked of him. "},{"num":28,"verse":"Therefore, I too have loaned him to Adonai — as long as he lives, he is on loan to Adonai.” And he prostrated himself there before Adonai."}]
