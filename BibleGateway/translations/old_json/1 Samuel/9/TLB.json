[{"num":9,"verse":"Kish was a rich, influential man from the tribe of Benjamin. He was the son of Abiel, grandson of Zeror, great-grandson of Becorath, and great-great-grandson of Aphiah.

And he was head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the land!"},{"num":3,"verse":"One day Kish’s donkeys strayed away, so he sent Saul and a servant to look for them. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They traveled all through the hill country of Ephraim, the land of Shalisha, the Shaalim area, and the entire land of Benjamin, but couldn’t find them anywhere. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Finally, after searching in the land of Zuph, Saul said to the servant, “Let’s go home; by now my father will be more worried about us than about the donkeys!”"},{"num":6,"verse":"But the servant said, “I’ve just thought of something! There is a prophet who lives here in this city; he is held in high honor by all the people because everything he says comes true; let’s go and find him, and perhaps he can tell us where the donkeys are.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"“But we don’t have anything to pay him with,” Saul replied. “Even our food is gone, and we don’t have a thing to give him.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"“Well,” the servant said, “I have a dollar! We can at least offer it to him and see what happens!”"},{"num":9,"verse":"“All right,” Saul agreed, “let’s try it!”"},{"num":12,"verse":"“Yes,” they replied, “stay right on this road. He lives just inside the city gates. He has just arrived back from a trip to take part in a public sacrifice up on the hill. So hurry, because he’ll probably be leaving about the time you get there; the guests can’t eat until he arrives and blesses the food.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"So they went into the city, and as they were entering the gates they saw Samuel coming out toward them to go up the hill.

"},{"num":20,"verse":"And don’t worry about those donkeys that were lost three days ago, for they have been found. And anyway, you own all the wealth of Israel now!”"},{"num":21,"verse":"“Pardon me, sir,” Saul replied. “I’m from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest in Israel, and my family is the least important of all the families of the tribe! You must have the wrong man!”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into the great hall and placed them at the head of the table, honoring them above the thirty special guests.
