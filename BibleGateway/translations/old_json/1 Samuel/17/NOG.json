The head of his spear was made of 15 pounds of iron. The man who carried his shield walked ahead of him."},{"num":8,"verse":"Goliath stood and called to the Israelites, “Why do you form a battle line? Am I not a Philistine, and aren’t you Saul’s servants? Choose a man, and let him come down to fight me. "},{"num":9,"verse":"If he can fight me and kill me, then we will be your slaves.

Then Eliab became angry with David. “Why did you come here,” he asked him, “and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how overconfident and headstrong you are. You came here just to see the battle.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"“What have I done now?” David snapped at him. “Didn’t I merely ask a question?” "},{"num":30,"verse":"He turned to face another man and asked the same question, and the other soldiers gave him the same answer."},{"num":31,"verse":"What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, who then sent for him.

You’re just a boy, but he’s been a warrior since he was your age.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"David replied to Saul, “I am a shepherd for my father’s sheep. Whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, "},{"num":35,"verse":"I went after it, struck it, and rescued the sheep from its mouth. If it attacked me, I took hold of its mane, struck it, and killed it.

"},{"num":39,"verse":"David fastened Saul’s sword over his clothes and tried to walk, but he had never practiced doing this. “I can’t walk in these things,” David told Saul. “I’ve never had any practice doing this.” So David took all those things off."},{"num":40,"verse":"He took his stick with him, picked out five smooth stones from the riverbed, and put them in his shepherd’s bag. With a sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine. "},{"num":41,"verse":"The Philistine, preceded by the man carrying his shield, was coming closer and closer to David. "},{"num":42,"verse":"When the Philistine got a good look at David, he despised him. After all, David was a young man with a healthy complexion and good looks."},{"num":43,"verse":"The Philistine asked David, “Am I a dog that you come to attack me with sticks?” So the Philistine called on his gods to curse David.

The stone sank into Goliath’s forehead, and he fell to the ground on his face. "},{"num":50,"verse":"So using only a sling and a stone, David proved to be stronger than the Philistine. David struck down and killed the Philistine, even though David didn’t have a sword in his hand. "},{"num":51,"verse":"David ran and stood over the Philistine.
