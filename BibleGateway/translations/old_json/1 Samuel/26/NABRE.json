"},{"num":3,"verse":"Saul camped beside the road on the hill of Hachilah, at the edge of Jeshimon. David, who was living in the wilderness, saw that Saul had come into the wilderness after him "},{"num":4,"verse":"and sent out scouts, who confirmed Saul’s arrival. "},{"num":5,"verse":"David then went to the place where Saul was encamped and saw the spot where Saul and his general, Abner, son of Ner, had their sleeping quarters. Saul was lying within the camp, and all his soldiers were bivouacked around him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"David asked Ahimelech the Hittite, and Abishai, son of Zeruiah and brother of Joab, “Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?” Abishai replied, “I will.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"So David and Abishai reached Saul’s soldiers by night, and there was Saul lying asleep within the camp, his spear thrust into the ground at his head and Abner and his troops sleeping around him."},{"num":8,"verse":"Abishai whispered to David: “God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Let me nail him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I will not need to strike him twice!” "},{"num":9,"verse":"But David said to Abishai, “Do not harm him, for who can lay a hand on the Lord’s anointed and remain innocent? "},{"num":10,"verse":"As the Lord lives,” David declared, “only the Lord can strike him: either when the time comes for him to die, or when he goes out and perishes in battle.

Who in Israel is your equal? Why were you not guarding your lord the king when one of his subjects came to assassinate the king, your lord? "},{"num":16,"verse":"What you have done is not right. As the Lord lives, you people deserve death because you have not guarded your lord, the anointed of the Lord. Go, look: where are the king’s spear and the water jug that was at his head?”"},{"num":17,"verse":"Saul Admits His Guilt.

If the Lord has incited you against me, may an offering please the Lord. But if it is the people who have done so, may they be cursed before the Lord.
