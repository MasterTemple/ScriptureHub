When he saw that Saul had followed him there,"},{"num":4,"verse":"he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped.

Abner and the soldiers were lying around him."},{"num":8,"verse":"Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands.
