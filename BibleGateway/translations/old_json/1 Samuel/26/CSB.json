"},{"num":3,"verse":"Saul camped beside the road at the hill of Hachilah opposite Jeshimon. David was living in the wilderness and discovered Saul had come there after him. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So David sent out spies and knew for certain that Saul had come. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Immediately, David went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of his army, were lying down. Saul was lying inside the inner circle of the camp with the troops camped around him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Then David asked Ahimelech the Hethite and Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, “Who will go with me into the camp to Saul?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"That night, David and Abishai came to the troops, and Saul was lying there asleep in the inner circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the troops were lying around him. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy to you. Let me thrust the spear through him into the ground just once. I won’t have to strike him twice!”"},{"num":9,"verse":"But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him, for who can lift a hand against the Lord’s anointed and be innocent?”  "},{"num":10,"verse":"David added, “As the Lord lives, the Lord will certainly strike him down: either his day will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. "},{"num":11,"verse":"However, as the Lord is my witness, I will never lift my hand against the Lord’s anointed.

Who in Israel is your equal? So why didn’t you protect your lord the king when one of the people came to destroy him? "},{"num":16,"verse":"What you have done is not good. As the Lord lives, all of you deserve to die since you didn’t protect your lord, the Lord’s anointed.

You will certainly do great things and will also prevail.” Then David went on his way, and Saul returned home."}]
