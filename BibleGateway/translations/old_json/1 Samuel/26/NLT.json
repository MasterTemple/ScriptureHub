Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of his army, were sleeping inside a ring formed by the slumbering warriors."},{"num":6,"verse":"“Who will volunteer to go in there with me?” David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother."},{"num":7,"verse":"So David and Abishai went right into Saul’s camp and found him asleep, with his spear stuck in the ground beside his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying asleep around him."},{"num":8,"verse":"“God has surely handed your enemy over to you this time!” Abishai whispered to David. “Let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won’t need to strike twice!”"},{"num":9,"verse":"“No!” David said. “Don’t kill him.

May he rescue me from all my troubles.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"And Saul said to David, “Blessings on you, my son David. You will do many heroic deeds, and you will surely succeed.” Then David went away, and Saul returned home."}]
