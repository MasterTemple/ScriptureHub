They looked for David in the Desert of Ziph. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Saul made his camp on the hill of Hakilah, beside the road opposite Jeshimon. But David stayed in the desert. He heard Saul had followed him. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So David sent out spies and learned that Saul had come to Hakilah."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then David went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner were sleeping. Abner was the commander of Saul’s army. Saul was sleeping in the middle of the camp with all the army around him."},{"num":6,"verse":"David talked to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah. Abishai was Joab’s brother.

His spear was stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the army were sleeping around Saul. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Abishai said to David, “Today God has let you defeat your enemy! Let me pin Saul to the ground with the spear. I’ll only do it once! I won’t hit him twice.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"But David said to Abishai, “Don’t kill Saul!

Then why didn’t you guard your master the king? Someone came into your camp to kill your master the king! "},{"num":16,"verse":"What you have done is not good.

Surely he will save me from all trouble.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"Then Saul said to David, “You are blessed, my son David. You will do great things and succeed.”"}]
