"},{"num":3,"verse":"Saul set up his camp beside the road. It was on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon. But David stayed in the desert. He saw that Saul had followed him there. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So he sent out scouts. From them he learned that Saul had arrived."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then David started out. He went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner were lying down. Saul was lying inside the camp. The army was camped all around him. Abner was commander of the army. He was the son of Ner."},{"num":6,"verse":"Then David spoke to Ahimelek, the Hittite. He also spoke to Joab’s brother Abishai, the son of Zeruiah.

Aren’t you going to answer me?”"},{"num":15,"verse":"David said, “You are a great soldier, aren’t you? There isn’t anyone else like you in Israel. So why didn’t you guard the king? He’s your master, isn’t he? Someone came into the camp to destroy him. "},{"num":16,"verse":"You didn’t guard him. And that isn’t good. You can be sure that the Lord lives. And you can be just as sure that you and your men must die. That’s because you didn’t guard your master. He’s the Lord’s anointed king. Look around you.

By doing that, they might as well have said, ‘Go and serve other gods.’ "},{"num":20,"verse":"Don’t spill my blood on the ground far away from where the Lord lives.
