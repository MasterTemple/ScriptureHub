When any man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged meat fork while the meat was boiling "},{"num":14,"verse":"and plunge it into the container or kettle or cauldron or cooking pot. The priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up. This is the way they treated all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast, because he won’t accept boiled meat from you—only raw.” "},{"num":16,"verse":"If that man said to him, “The fat must be burned first; then you can take whatever you want for yourself,” the servant would reply, “No, I insist that you hand it over right now. If you don’t, I’ll take it by force!” "},{"num":17,"verse":"So the servants’ sin was very severe in the presence of the Lord, because they treated the Lord’s offering with contempt."},{"num":18,"verse":"The boy Samuel served in the Lord’s presence and wore a linen ephod.
