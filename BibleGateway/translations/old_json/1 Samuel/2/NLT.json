All the Israelites who came to worship at Shiloh were treated this way."},{"num":15,"verse":"Sometimes the servant would come even before the animal’s fat had been burned on the altar. He would demand raw meat before it had been boiled so that it could be used for roasting."},{"num":16,"verse":"The man offering the sacrifice might reply, “Take as much as you want, but the fat must be burned first.” Then the servant would demand, “No, give it to me now, or I’ll take it by force.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"So the sin of these young men was very serious in the Lord’s sight, for they treated the Lord’s offerings with contempt."},{"num":18,"verse":"But Samuel, though he was only a boy, served the Lord.

Why do you keep sinning?"},{"num":24,"verse":"You must stop, my sons! The reports I hear among the Lord’s people are not good."},{"num":25,"verse":"If someone sins against another person, God can mediate for the guilty party.

I will establish his family, and they will be priests to my anointed kings forever."},{"num":36,"verse":"Then all of your surviving family will bow before him, begging for money and food. ‘Please,’ they will say, ‘give us jobs among the priests so we will have enough to eat.’”"}]
