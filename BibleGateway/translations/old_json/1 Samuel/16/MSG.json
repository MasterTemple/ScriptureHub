Fill your flask with anointing oil and get going. I’m sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I’ve spotted the very king I want among his sons.”"},{"num":2,"verse":"“I can’t do that,” said Samuel. “Saul will hear about it and kill me.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Samuel did what God told him. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the town fathers greeted him, but apprehensively. “Is there something wrong?”"},{"num":5,"verse":"“Nothing’s wrong. I’ve come to sacrifice this heifer and lead you in the worship of God. Prepare yourselves, be consecrated, and join me in worship.” He made sure Jesse and his sons were also consecrated and called to worship."},{"num":6,"verse":"When they arrived, Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, “Here he is! God’s anointed!”"},{"num":7,"verse":"But God told Samuel, “Looks aren’t everything. Don’t be impressed with his looks and stature. I’ve already eliminated him. God judges persons differently than humans do. Men and women look at the face; God looks into the heart.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Jesse then called up Abinadab and presented him to Samuel. Samuel said, “This man isn’t God’s choice either.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Next Jesse presented Shammah. Samuel said, “No, this man isn’t either.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Jesse presented his seven sons to Samuel.

Let us look for someone who can play the harp. When the black mood from God moves in, he’ll play his music and you’ll feel better.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"Saul told his servants, “Go ahead. Find me someone who can play well and bring him to me.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"One of the young men spoke up, “I know someone. I’ve seen him myself: the son of Jesse of Bethlehem, an excellent musician. He’s also courageous, of age, well-spoken, and good-looking. And God is with him.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"So Saul sent messengers to Jesse requesting, “Send your son David to me, the one who tends the sheep.”"},{"num":20,"verse":"Jesse took a donkey, loaded it with a couple of loaves of bread, a flask of wine, and a young goat, and sent his son David with it to Saul.
