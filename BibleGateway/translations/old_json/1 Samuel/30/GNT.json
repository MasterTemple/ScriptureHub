"},{"num":3,"verse":"When David and his men arrived, they found that the town had been burned down and that their wives, sons, and daughters had been carried away. "},{"num":4,"verse":"David and his men started crying and did not stop until they were completely exhausted. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Even David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had been taken away."},{"num":6,"verse":"David was now in great trouble, because his men were all very bitter about losing their children, and they were threatening to stone him; but the Lord his God gave him courage. "},{"num":7,"verse":"David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod,” and Abiathar brought it to him. "},{"num":8,"verse":"David asked the Lord, “Shall I go after those raiders? And will I catch them?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So David and his six hundred men started out, and when they arrived at Besor Brook, some of them stayed there. "},{"num":10,"verse":"David continued on his way with four hundred men; the other two hundred men were too tired to cross the brook and so stayed behind. "},{"num":11,"verse":"The men with David found a young Egyptian out in the country and brought him to David.

David got back all his men's sons and daughters, and all the loot the Amalekites had taken. "},{"num":20,"verse":"He also recovered all the flocks and herds; his men drove all the livestock in front of them and said, “This belongs to David!”"},{"num":21,"verse":"Then David went back to the two hundred men who had been too weak to go with him and had stayed behind at Besor Brook. They came forward to meet David and his men, and David went up to them and greeted them warmly.
