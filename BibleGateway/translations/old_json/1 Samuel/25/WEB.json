[{"num":25,"verse":"Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and mourned for him, and buried him at his house at Ramah."},{"num":2,"verse":"There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. This woman was intelligent and had a beautiful face; but the man was surly and evil in his doings. He was of the house of Caleb. "},{"num":4,"verse":"David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. "},{"num":5,"verse":"David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Tell him, ‘Long life to you! Peace be to you! Peace be to your house! Peace be to all that you have! "},{"num":7,"verse":"Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn’t harm them. Nothing was missing from them all the time they were in Carmel. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come on a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.’”"},{"num":9,"verse":"When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal all those words in the name of David, and waited."},{"num":10,"verse":"Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Shall I then take my bread, my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don’t know where they come from?”"},{"num":12,"verse":"So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him all these words."},{"num":13,"verse":"David said to his men, “Every man put on his sword!”"},{"num":14,"verse":"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master; and he insulted them.

Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, didn’t see my lord’s young men, whom you sent.

When Yahweh has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"David said to Abigail, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me! "},{"num":33,"verse":"Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, who have kept me today from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand. "},{"num":34,"verse":"For indeed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from harming you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn’t have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”"},{"num":35,"verse":"So David received from her hand that which she had brought him. Then he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request.”"},{"num":36,"verse":"Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king.
