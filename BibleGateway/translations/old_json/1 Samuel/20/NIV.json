How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to kill me?”"},{"num":2,"verse":"“Never!” Jonathan replied. “You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn’t so!”"},{"num":3,"verse":"But David took an oath and said, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.’ Yet as surely as the Lord lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do for you.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon feast, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow."},{"num":6,"verse":"If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.’"},{"num":7,"verse":"If he says, ‘Very well,’ then your servant is safe.
