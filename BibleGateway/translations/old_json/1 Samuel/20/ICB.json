How have I sinned against your father so that he’s trying to kill me?”"},{"num":2,"verse":"Jonathan answered, “No! You won’t die! See, my father doesn’t do anything without first telling me. It doesn’t matter if it is very important or just a small thing. Why would he refuse to tell me he wants to kill you? No, it’s not true!”"},{"num":3,"verse":"But David took an oath. He said, “Your father knows very well that I’m your friend. He has said to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know about it. If he knows, he will tell David.’ But as surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I am very close to death!”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “I’ll do anything you want me to do.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival.

"},{"num":29,"verse":"He said, ‘Let me go, because our family has a sacrifice in the town. And my brother has ordered me to be there.
