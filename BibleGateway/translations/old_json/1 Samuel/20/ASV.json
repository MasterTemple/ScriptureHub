[{"num":20,"verse":"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life? "},{"num":2,"verse":"And he said unto him, Far from it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. "},{"num":3,"verse":"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father knoweth well that I have found favor in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even. "},{"num":6,"verse":"If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family. "},{"num":7,"verse":"If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee: but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father? "},{"num":9,"verse":"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee? "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly? "},{"num":11,"verse":"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father. "},{"num":14,"verse":"And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not; "},{"num":15,"verse":"but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.

"},{"num":26,"verse":"Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean. "},{"num":27,"verse":"And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day? "},{"num":28,"verse":"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem: "},{"num":29,"verse":"and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king’s table."},{"num":30,"verse":"Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother’s nakedness?

"},{"num":32,"verse":"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done? "},{"num":33,"verse":"And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put David to death. "},{"num":34,"verse":"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame."},{"num":35,"verse":"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. "},{"num":36,"verse":"And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
