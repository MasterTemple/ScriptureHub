What is my sin against your father that makes him seek my life?”"},{"num":2,"verse":"Jonathan said to him, “A curse on me if that happens. You will not die. Look, my father does nothing whether important or unimportant without telling me about it. Why would my father hide this from me? It is not so.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"But David took an oath and said, “Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes, so he might say, ‘Do not let Jonathan know about this, or he will be very upset.’ But as surely as the Lord lives, and as surely as your soul lives, there is only a step between me and death.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then Jonathan said to David, “Ask me for whatever you really want, and I will do it for you.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"David said to Jonathan, “Listen, tomorrow is the new moon, and I am expected to dine with the king, but let me go so that I can hide in the countryside until the evening of the third day.

Why should you bring me to your father?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Jonathan said, “A curse on me if that occurs, because if I knew that my father was planning to harm you, wouldn’t I tell you?”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father gives you a harsh response?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “Come, let’s go out into the field.” So the two of them went out into the field.

Come and pick them up,’ then you can come to me, because you are safe and, as the Lord lives, there is no danger. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But if I yell to the boy, ‘Hey!

That’s what it is—he must be unclean.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"On the day after the new moon, the second day of the month, David’s place was still empty. So Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why didn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”"},{"num":28,"verse":"Jonathan answered Saul, “David begged me for permission to go to Bethlehem. "},{"num":29,"verse":"He said, ‘Please let me go, because our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has ordered me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please excuse me so I can go and see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverted, unfaithful woman! Don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?
