"},{"num":5,"verse":"The crag on the north was in front of Michmash and the southern one was in front of Geba."},{"num":6,"verse":"“Yes, let’s go across to those heathen,” Jonathan had said to his bodyguard. “Perhaps the Lord will do a miracle for us. For it makes no difference to him how many enemy troops there are!”"},{"num":7,"verse":"“Fine!” the youth replied. “Do as you think best; I’m with you heart and soul, whatever you decide.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"“All right, then this is what we’ll do,” Jonathan told him. "},{"num":9,"verse":"“When they see us, if they say, ‘Stay where you are or we’ll kill you!’ then we will stop and wait for them. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But if they say, ‘Come on up and fight!’ then we will do just that; for it will be God’s signal that he will help us defeat them!”"},{"num":11,"verse":"When the Philistines saw them coming they shouted, “Look! The Israelis are crawling out of their holes!” "},{"num":12,"verse":"Then they shouted to Jonathan, “Come on up here and we’ll show you how to fight!”"},{"num":13,"verse":"So they clambered up on their hands and knees, and the Philistines fell back as Jonathan and the lad killed them right and left, "},{"num":14,"verse":"about twenty men in all, and their bodies were scattered over about half an acre of land.

What does God say?” Saul demanded."},{"num":20,"verse":"Then Saul and his six hundred men rushed out to the battle and found the Philistines killing each other, and there was terrible confusion everywhere. "},{"num":21,"verse":"And now the Hebrews who had been drafted into the Philistine army revolted and joined with the Israelis.

What is wrong? Are Jonathan and I guilty, or is the sin among the others? O Lord God, show us who is guilty.” And Jonathan and Saul were chosen by sacred lot as the guilty ones, and the people were declared innocent."},{"num":42,"verse":"Then Saul said, “Now draw lots between me and Jonathan.” And Jonathan was chosen as the guilty one."},{"num":43,"verse":"“Tell me what you’ve done,” Saul demanded of Jonathan."},{"num":44,"verse":"“Yes, Jonathan,” Saul said, “you must die; may God strike me dead if you are not executed for this.”"},{"num":45,"verse":"But the troops retorted, “Jonathan, who saved Israel today, shall die?
