These kings were from the hill country and from the foothills to the west, as well as from the Mediterranean seacoast as far north as the Lebanon Mountains. Some of them were Hittites, others were Amorites or Canaanites, and still others were Perizzites, Hivites, or Jebusites."},{"num":3,"verse":"The people of Gibeon had also heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So they decided that some of their men should pretend to be messengers to Israel from a faraway country. The men put worn-out bags on their donkeys and found some old wineskins that had cracked and had been sewn back together. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Their sandals were old and patched, and their clothes were worn out. They even took along some dry and crumbly bread. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Then they went to the Israelite camp at Gilgal, where they said to Joshua and the men of Israel, “We have come from a country that is far from here. Please make a peace treaty with us.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The Israelites replied, “But maybe you really live near us. We can’t make a peace treaty with you if you live nearby.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"The Israelites tried some of the food, but they did not ask the Lord if he wanted them to make a treaty.

We just ask you to do what seems right.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"Joshua did not let the Israelites kill the Gibeonites, "},{"num":27,"verse":"but he did tell the Gibeonites that they would have to be servants of the nation of Israel.
