But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai"},{"num":4,"verse":"and they devised a cunning plot. They prepared provisions, collecting them and putting them into old sacks upon their donkeys, along with old wineskins that were torn and mended."},{"num":5,"verse":"They put old mended sandals on their feet, and dressed in old clothing, making sure that all of their provisions were dried out and crumbling."},{"num":6,"verse":"They came to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal and said to him and to the people of Israel, “We have come here from a distant country, so make a covenant with us.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The Israelites said to the Hivites, “Maybe you actually live among us, how could we make a covenant with you?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"They then said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and where do you come from?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"They said to him, “We, your servants, come from a very distant land because of the name of the Lord, your God.

We truly feared for our lives, for you would have done this thing."},{"num":25,"verse":"So therefore, we are in your hands. Do whatever you consider to be right to us.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"And so this is what he did to them: he rescued them out of the hands of the Israelites so that they did not kill them,"},{"num":27,"verse":"but Joshua established them that day as the ones who would cut firewood and draw water for the assembly and for the altar of the Lord in the place that he would choose, which they still do today."}]
