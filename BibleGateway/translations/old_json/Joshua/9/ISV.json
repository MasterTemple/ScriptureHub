[{"header":"Trickery by the Gibeonites"},{"num":9,"verse":"Eventually all the kings who reigned in the hill country across the Jordan River and in the low-lying coastlands of the Mediterranean Sea facing Lebanon heard about this.

All of their food was dried out and covered in mold. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Then they approached Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and addressed him and the Israelis, “We’ve arrived from a distant country, so please make a treaty with us right now.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"But the Israelis responded to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live in our midst. If this is so, how can we make a treaty with you?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"So they responded to Joshua, “We are your servants.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"They answered, “Your servants have arrived from a very distant land, because of the reputation of the Lord your God, because we’ve heard a report about all that he did in Egypt, "},{"num":10,"verse":"along with all of what he did to the two Amorite kings who were beyond the Jordan River—that is, to King Sihon of Heshbon and to King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth. "},{"num":11,"verse":"So our leaders and all of the inhabitants of our country told us, ‘Take provisions along with you for your journey, go to meet them, and tell them, “We are your servants. Come now and make a treaty with us.”’ "},{"num":12,"verse":"Look at our bread: it was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for our journey on the very day we set out to come to you.

And our clothes and sandals are worn out from our very long journey.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"So the leaders of Israel sampled their provisions, but did not ask the Lord about it. "},{"num":15,"verse":"They made a treaty with them, guaranteeing their lives with a covenant, and the leaders of the congregation confirmed it with an oath to them."},{"num":16,"verse":"But three days after they had made the treaty with them, they learned that they were their neighbors and were living in their midst.

"},{"num":18,"verse":"The Israelis did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had made an oath with them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
