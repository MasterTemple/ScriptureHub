[{"header":"The Gibeonite deception"},{"num":9,"verse":"Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things – the kings in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Mediterranean Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites) – "},{"num":2,"verse":"they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel."},{"num":3,"verse":"However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, "},{"num":4,"verse":"they resorted to a ruse: they went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and mouldy. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the Israelites, ‘We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us.’"},{"num":7,"verse":"The Israelites said to the Hivites, ‘But perhaps you live near us, so how can we make a treaty with you?’"},{"num":8,"verse":"‘We are your servants,’ they said to Joshua."},{"num":9,"verse":"They answered: ‘Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the Lord your God.
