I’ve already given Jericho to you, along with its king and its elite forces. Here’s what you are to do: March around the city, all your soldiers. Circle the city once. Repeat this for six days. Have seven priests carry seven ram’s horn trumpets in front of the Chest. On the seventh day march around the city seven times, the priests blowing away on the trumpets. And then, a long blast on the ram’s horn—when you hear that, all the people are to shout at the top of their lungs. The city wall will collapse at once. All the people are to enter, every man straight on in.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and told them, “Take up the Chest of the Covenant.

It circled once, came back to camp, and stayed for the night. Joshua was up early the next morning and the priests took up the Chest of God.
