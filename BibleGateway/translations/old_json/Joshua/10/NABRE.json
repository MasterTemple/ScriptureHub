"},{"num":3,"verse":"So Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham, king of Hebron, Piram, king of Jarmuth, Japhia, king of Lachish, and Debir, king of Eglon, with this message: "},{"num":4,"verse":"“Come and help me attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"The five Amorite kings, of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon, gathered with all their forces, and marched against Gibeon to make war on it. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Thereupon, the Gibeonites sent an appeal to Joshua in his camp at Gilgal: “Do not abandon your servants. Come up here quickly and save us. Help us, because all the Amorite kings of the mountain country have joined together against us.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Joshua’s Victory. So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with all his army and all his warriors. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The Lord said to Joshua: Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your power. Not one of them will be able to withstand you. "},{"num":9,"verse":"After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua made a surprise attack upon them, "},{"num":10,"verse":"and the Lord threw them into disorder before Israel.
