"},{"num":4,"verse":"The children or grandchildren of a widow must first learn to respect their own family by repaying their parents. This is pleasing in God’s sight."},{"num":5,"verse":"A widow who has no family has placed her confidence in God by praying and asking for his help night and day. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead although she is still alive. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Insist on these things so that widows will have good reputations.
