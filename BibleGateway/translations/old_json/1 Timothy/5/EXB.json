[{"header":"Rules for Living with Others"},{"num":5,"verse":"Do not ·speak angrily to [rebuke; speak harshly to] an older man, but ·plead with [exhort; encourage] him as if he were your father.

"},{"num":4,"verse":"But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to ·do their duty to [or practice their piety/godliness toward] their own ·family [household] and to repay their parents or grandparents. [For] That pleases God. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The true widow, who is all alone, puts her hope in God and continues ·to pray night and day for God’s help [in petitions and prayers night and day]. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But the widow who ·uses her life to please herself [lives in luxury; is self-indulgent] is really dead while she is alive.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"Besides that, they learn to ·waste their time [be idle], going from house to house. And they not only ·waste their time [are idlers] but also begin to gossip and ·busy themselves with other people’s lives [become busybodies/meddlers], saying things they should not say. "},{"num":14,"verse":"So I want the younger widows to marry, have children, and manage their homes. Then ·no enemy will [or the adversary will not; Satan] have any ·reason [or opportunity] ·to criticize them [or for maligning/slandering (us/them)]. "},{"num":15,"verse":"But some have already ·turned [wandered; strayed] away to follow Satan."},{"num":16,"verse":"If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should ·care for [provide support for] them herself. The church should not ·have to care for them [carry this burden]. Then it will be able to ·take care of [support] those who are truly widows."},{"num":17,"verse":"The elders who lead the church well should receive ·double honor [or both honor and remuneration; probably includes both respect and financial support; see v. 3], especially those who work hard by ·speaking [preaching] and teaching, "},{"num":18,"verse":"because the Scripture says: “When an ox is ·working in the grain [threshing], do not ·cover its mouth to keep it from eating [muzzle it; Deut. 25:4],” and “A worker ·should be given his pay [deserves his wages; is worthy of his hire; Luke 10:7].”"},{"num":19,"verse":"Do not listen to someone who accuses an elder, without two or three witnesses [Deut. 19:15].
