[{"header":"Israel Is Judged for Its Sin"},{"num":9,"verse":"Do not be happy, O Israel! Do not be glad like the nations!

"},{"num":3,"verse":"They will not stay in the Lord’s land, but Ephraim will return to Egypt. And in Assyria they will eat unclean food. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They will not pour out drink gifts of wine to the Lord. Their gifts of worship will not please Him. Their bread will be like the bread of those in sorrow.
