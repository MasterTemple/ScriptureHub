"},{"num":3,"verse":"Why is the Lord bringing us to this land? We’re going to be killed by swords. Our enemies will capture our wives and children. Wouldn’t it be better for us to go back to Egypt?” "},{"num":4,"verse":"They said to one another, “We should choose another leader. We should go back to Egypt.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Then Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground. They did it in front of the whole community of Israel gathered there. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Joshua, the son of Nun, tore his clothes. So did Caleb, the son of Jephunneh. Joshua and Caleb were two of the men who had checked out the land.

You will know what it is like to have me against you.’ "},{"num":35,"verse":"I, the Lord, have spoken. I will surely do these things to this entire evil community of Israel. They have joined together against me. They will meet their end in this desert. They will die here.”"},{"num":36,"verse":"So the Lord struck down the men Moses had sent to check out the land.
