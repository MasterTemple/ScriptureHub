"},{"num":4,"verse":"They will be joined to you to perform the duties associated with the tent of meeting, all the labor pertaining to the tent. But no unauthorized person shall come near you. "},{"num":5,"verse":"You shall perform the duties of the sanctuary and of the altar, that wrath may not fall again upon the Israelites."},{"num":6,"verse":"I hereby take your kinsmen, the Levites, from among the Israelites; they are a gift to you, dedicated to the Lord for the labor they perform for the tent of meeting.

As holy, they belong to you."},{"num":11,"verse":"This also you shall have: the contributions that are their gifts, including the elevated offering of the Israelites; I assign them to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual due. All in your household who are clean may eat them.

"},{"num":23,"verse":"Only the Levites are to perform the labor pertaining to the tent of meeting, and they shall incur the penalty for the Israelites’ sin; this is a permanent statute for all your generations. But they shall not have any heritage among the Israelites, "},{"num":24,"verse":"for I have assigned to the Levites as their heritage the tithes which the Israelites put aside as a contribution to the Lord. That is why I have said, they will not have any heritage among the Israelites."},{"num":25,"verse":"Tithes Paid by the Levites. The Lord said to Moses: "},{"num":26,"verse":"Speak to the Levites and say to them: When you take from the Israelites the tithes I have assigned you from them as your heritage, you are to make a contribution from them to the Lord, a tithe of the tithe; "},{"num":27,"verse":"and your contribution will be credited to you as if it were grain from the threshing floor or new wine from the vat.
