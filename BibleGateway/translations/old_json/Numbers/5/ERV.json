When you do that, you are really sinning against God. So you are guilty of doing wrong."},{"num":7,"verse":"You must confess that sin. Then you must fully pay for that wrong thing you did. You must add one-fifth to the payment and give it all to the person you had done wrong to."},{"num":8,"verse":"But maybe the person is dead and does not have any close relatives to accept the payment. In that case, you will give the payment to the Lord. That is, you will give the full payment to the priest. The priest must sacrifice the ram that makes people pure.

The husband must also take an offering of 8 cups of barley flour. He must not pour oil or incense on the barley flour.

This offering will show that he thinks his wife has been unfaithful to him."},{"num":16,"verse":"“The priest will take the woman before the Lord and make her stand there."},{"num":17,"verse":"Then he will take some special water and put it in a clay jar.
