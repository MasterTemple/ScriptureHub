You know all about that. And then, when we came to you, many people there caused trouble for us. But our God gave us the courage we needed to tell you his Good News."},{"num":3,"verse":"When we encourage people to believe the Good News, it’s not out of wrong motives. We are not trying to trick or fool anyone."},{"num":4,"verse":"No, we did it because God is the one who gave us this work. And this was only after he tested us and saw that we could be trusted to do it. So when we speak, we are only trying to please God, not anyone else. He is the one who can see what is in our hearts."},{"num":5,"verse":"You know that we never tried to influence you by saying nice things about you. We were not trying to get your money. We had no greed to hide from you. God knows that this is true."},{"num":6,"verse":"We were not looking for praise from people—not from you or anyone else."},{"num":7,"verse":"When we were with you, as apostles of Christ we could have used our authority to make you help us. But we were very gentle with you. We were like a mother caring for her little children."},{"num":8,"verse":"We loved you very much, so we were happy to share God’s Good News with you. But not only that—we were also happy to share even our own lives with you."},{"num":9,"verse":"Brothers and sisters, I know that you remember how hard we worked.

He calls you to be part of his glorious kingdom."},{"num":13,"verse":"Also, we always thank God because of the way you accepted his message. You heard it and accepted it as God’s message, not our own. And it really is God’s message. And it works in you who believe."},{"num":14,"verse":"Brothers and sisters, you are just like God’s churches in Judea. I mean that you were treated badly by your own people, just as those believers in Christ Jesus were treated badly by other Jews—"},{"num":15,"verse":"the same Jews who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets. And they forced us to leave their country. They are not pleasing to God, and they are against everyone else."},{"num":16,"verse":"And they are trying to stop us from teaching those who are not Jews.

But even though we were not there, our thoughts were still with you. We wanted very much to see you, and we tried very hard to do this."},{"num":18,"verse":"Yes, we wanted to come to you.
