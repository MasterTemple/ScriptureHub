"},{"num":4,"verse":"Instead, since God has tested us and found us fit to be entrusted with Good News, this is how we speak: not to win favor with people but with God, who tests our hearts. "},{"num":5,"verse":"For, as you know, never did we employ flattering talk, nor did we put on a false front to mask greed — God is witness. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Nor did we seek human praise — either from you or from others. "},{"num":7,"verse":"As emissaries of the Messiah, we could have made our weight felt; but instead, we were gentle when we were with you, like a mother feeding and caring for her children.
