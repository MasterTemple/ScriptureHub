[{"num":5,"verse":"Now there arose a great cry of the [poor] people and of their wives [driven to borrowing] against their Jewish brethren [the few who could afford to lend]."},{"num":2,"verse":"For some said, We, our sons and daughters, are many; therefore allow us to take grain, that we may eat and live! If we are not given grain, let us take it!"},{"num":3,"verse":"Also some said, We are mortgaging our lands, vineyards, and houses to buy grain because of the scarcity."},{"num":4,"verse":"Others said, We have borrowed money on our fields and vineyards to pay the [Persian] kingâ€™s heavy tax."},{"num":5,"verse":"Although our flesh is the same as that of our brethren and our children are as theirs, yet we are forced to sell our children as slaves; some of our daughters have already been thus sold, and we are powerless to redeem them, for others have our lands and vineyards."},{"num":6,"verse":"I [Nehemiah] was very angry when I heard their cry and these words."},{"num":7,"verse":"I thought it over and then rebuked the nobles and officials. I told them, You are exacting interest from your own kinsmen. And I held a great assembly against them."},{"num":8,"verse":"I said to them, We, according to our ability, have bought back our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations; but will you even sell your brethren, that they may be sold to us?

Let us stop this forbidden interest!"},{"num":11,"verse":"Return this very day to them their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses, and also a hundredth of all the money, grain, new wine, and oil that you have exacted from them."},{"num":12,"verse":"Then they said, We will restore these and require nothing from them.
