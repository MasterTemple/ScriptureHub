"},{"num":2,"verse":"In front of his companions and the Samaritan troops he said, “What do these miserable Jews think they're doing? Do they intend to rebuild the city? Do they think that by offering sacrifices they can finish the work in one day? Can they make building stones out of heaps of burnt rubble?”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Tobiah was standing there beside him, and he added, “What kind of wall could they ever build? Even a fox could knock it down!”"},{"num":4,"verse":"I prayed, “Hear how they make fun of us, O God! Let their ridicule fall on their own heads.
