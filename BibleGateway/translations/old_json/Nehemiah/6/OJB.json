[{"num":6,"verse":"Now it came to pass when Sanvalat, and Toviyah, and Geshem the Arab, and the rest of oyveinu (our enemies), heard that I had rebuilt HaChomah, and that there was no peretz (gap) left therein (though at that time I had not set up the dalatot in the she’arim),"},{"num":2,"verse":"That Sanvalat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they were choshevim (the ones scheming) to do me ra’ah (harm)."},{"num":3,"verse":"And I sent malachim unto them, saying, I am doing a melachah gedolah, so that I cannot come down. Why should the melachah cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?"},{"num":4,"verse":"Yet they sent unto me this message arbah pe’amim; and I answered them after the same manner."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then sent Sanvalat his aid unto me in like manner the fifth time with an unsealed iggeret in his hand;"},{"num":6,"verse":"Wherein was written, It is reported among the Goyim, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Yehudim are choshevim (the ones scheming) revolt, for which cause thou buildest the Chomah, that thou mayest be their Melech, according to these reports."},{"num":7,"verse":"And thou hast also appointed nevi’im to make this proclamation about thee at Yerushalayim, saying, There is a Melech in Yehudah!
