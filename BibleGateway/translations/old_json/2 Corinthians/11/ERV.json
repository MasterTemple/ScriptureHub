I want to give you to Christ to be his pure bride."},{"num":3,"verse":"But I am afraid that your minds will be led away from your true and pure following of Christ. This could happen just as Eve was tricked by that snake with his clever lies."},{"num":4,"verse":"You seem to be quite patient with anyone who comes to you and tells you about a Jesus that is different from the Jesus we told you about. You seem very willing to accept a spirit or a message that is different from the Spirit and message that you received from us."},{"num":5,"verse":"I don’t think that those “super apostles” are any better than I am."},{"num":6,"verse":"It is true that I am not a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge.

God knows that I love you."},{"num":12,"verse":"And I will continue doing what I am doing now, because I want to stop those people from having a reason to boast. They would like to say that the work they boast about is the same as ours."},{"num":13,"verse":"They are false apostles, lying workers. They only pretend to be apostles of Christ."},{"num":14,"verse":"That does not surprise us, because even Satan changes himself to look like an angel of light."},{"num":15,"verse":"So it does not surprise us if Satan’s servants make themselves look like servants who work for what is right.

So I will boast too."},{"num":19,"verse":"You are wise, so you will gladly be patient with fools!"},{"num":20,"verse":"I say this because you are even patient with someone who forces you to do things and uses you. You are patient with those who trick you, or think they are better than you, or hit you in the face!"},{"num":21,"verse":"I am ashamed to say it, but we were too “weak” to do such things to you."},{"num":22,"verse":"Are those people Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they from Abraham’s family? So am I."},{"num":23,"verse":"Are they serving Christ? I am serving him more. (I am crazy to talk like this.)

One time I was almost killed with rocks. Three times I was in ships that were wrecked, and one of those times I spent the night and the next day in the sea."},{"num":26,"verse":"In my constant traveling I have been in danger from rivers, from thieves, from my own people, and from people who are not Jews. I have been in danger in cities, in places where no one lives, and on the sea. And I have been in danger from people who pretend to be believers but are not."},{"num":27,"verse":"I have done hard and tiring work, and many times I did not sleep. I have been hungry and thirsty.
