[{"num":11,"verse":"Please endure a little foolishness on my part; you have come so far with me already. "},{"num":2,"verse":"To be completely honest, I am extremely jealous for you; but it’s the same kind of jealousy God has for you. You see, like an attentive father, I have pledged your hand in marriage and promised to present you as a pure virgin to the One who would be your husband, the Anointed One. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But now I’m afraid that as that serpent tricked Eve with his wiles, so your hearts and minds will be tricked and you will stray from the single-minded love and pure devotion to Him. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So then, if someone comes along and presents you with a Jesus different from the one we told you about, or if you receive a spirit different from the one gifted through our Lord Jesus, or even if you hear a gospel different from the one you heard through us; then you’re ready to go with it."},{"num":5,"verse":"I consider myself in league with the so-called great emissaries; I lack nothing.

It’s not because I don’t love you—God knows I do—"},{"num":12,"verse":"but I will continue doing what I am doing to cut off any opportunity—clearly some are looking for one—for these false emissaries, these low-down, untrustworthy preachers, these posers who act as emissaries of the Anointed, to claim that they work under the same terms that we do. "},{"num":14,"verse":"No wonder they are so good at it.
