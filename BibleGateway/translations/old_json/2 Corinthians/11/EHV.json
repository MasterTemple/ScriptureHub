"},{"num":2,"verse":"You see, I am jealous about you, with a godly jealousy, because I promised to present you as a pure virgin to one husband, Christ. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But I am afraid that somehow, just as the serpent deceived Eve with his cunning, so also your minds might be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. "},{"num":4,"verse":"In fact, if someone comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you accept a different spirit, which you did not accept before, or a different “gospel,” which you did not welcome before, you put up with it all too well. "},{"num":5,"verse":"I do not think that I am in any way inferior to the “super-apostles.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"But even if I am an amateur in speech, yet I am not an amateur in knowledge. No, in everything we have clearly demonstrated that to you in every way."},{"num":7,"verse":"Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself, so that you would be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?

"},{"num":14,"verse":"And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"What I am saying when I boast so confidently is not the way the Lord speaks; rather, it is a foolish manner of speaking. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Since many are boasting as the sinful flesh does, I will also boast. "},{"num":19,"verse":"You gladly put up with fools, since you are just so wise!
