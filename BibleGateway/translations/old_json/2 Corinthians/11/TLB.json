"},{"num":2,"verse":"I am anxious for you with the deep concern of God himself—anxious that your love should be for Christ alone, just as a pure maiden saves her love for one man only, for the one who will be her husband. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But I am frightened, fearing that in some way you will be led away from your pure and simple devotion to our Lord, just as Eve was deceived by Satan in the Garden of Eden. "},{"num":4,"verse":"You seem so gullible: you believe whatever anyone tells you even if he is preaching about another Jesus than the one we preach, or a different spirit than the Holy Spirit you received, or shows you a different way to be saved. You swallow it all."},{"num":5,"verse":"Yet I don’t feel that these marvelous “messengers from God,” as they call themselves, are any better than I am.
