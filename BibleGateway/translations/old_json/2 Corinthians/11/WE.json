I see you as a woman who has not been married and I am giving you to be the wife of a husband. That husband is Christ."},{"num":3,"verse":"But the snake fooled Eve by his trick. And I am afraid that your minds will be drawn away from a clean, pure love of Christ."},{"num":4,"verse":"You listen to a new man when he comes to tell you about a different Jesus, which is not the one we told you about.

Anything that others want to be proud of, I can talk about too. And yet it is really foolish to do so."},{"num":21,"verse":"Are they Hebrew people? So am I. Are they Israel's people? So am I. Is Abraham their father? He is mine too."},{"num":22,"verse":"Are they workers for Christ? (I talk like one who is not in his right mind.) I am a better worker. I have worked much harder.
