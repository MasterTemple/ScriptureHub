I’ve already said that you are in our hearts so that we die and live together with you."},{"num":4,"verse":"I have every confidence in you. I’m terribly proud of you. I’m filled with encouragement. I’m overwhelmed with happiness while in the middle of our problems."},{"header":"Titus’ good report"},{"num":5,"verse":"Even after we arrived in Macedonia, we couldn’t rest physically.

Well—I did regret it just a bit because I see that that letter made you sad, though only for a short time."},{"num":9,"verse":"Now I’m glad—not because you were sad but because you were made sad enough to change your hearts and lives. You felt godly sadness so that no one was harmed by us in any way."},{"num":10,"verse":"Godly sadness produces a changed heart and life that leads to salvation and leaves no regrets, but sorrow under the influence of the world produces death."},{"num":11,"verse":"Look at what this very experience of godly sadness has produced in you: such enthusiasm, what a desire to clear yourselves of blame, such indignation, what fear, what purpose, such concern, what justice! In everything you have shown yourselves to be innocent in the matter."},{"num":12,"verse":"So although I wrote to you, it wasn’t for the sake of the one who did wrong, or for the sake of the one who was wronged, but to show you your own enthusiasm for us in the sight of God."},{"num":13,"verse":"Because of this we have been encouraged. And in addition to our own encouragement, we were even more pleased at how happy Titus was. His mind has been put at rest by all of you."},{"num":14,"verse":"If I’ve bragged about you to him in any way, I haven’t been embarrassed.
