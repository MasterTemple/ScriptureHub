[{"header":"Paul’s Apostolic Authority"},{"num":10,"verse":"Now I, Paul, myself, appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am humble among you in person but bold toward you when absent. "},{"num":2,"verse":"I beg you that when I am present I will not need to be bold with the confidence by which I plan to challenge certain people who think we are living according to the flesh. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For although we live in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh, "},{"num":4,"verse":"since the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but are powerful through God for the demolition of strongholds. We demolish arguments "},{"num":5,"verse":"and every proud thing that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive to obey Christ. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And we are ready to punish any disobedience, once your obedience is complete."},{"num":7,"verse":"Look at what is obvious. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, let him remind himself of this: Just as he belongs to Christ, so do we. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For if I boast a little too much about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down, I will not be put to shame. "},{"num":9,"verse":"I don’t want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters. "},{"num":10,"verse":"For it is said, “His letters are weighty and powerful, but his physical presence is weak and his public speaking amounts to nothing.” "},{"num":11,"verse":"Let such a person consider this: What we are in our letters, when we are absent, we will also be in our actions when we are present."},{"num":12,"verse":"For we don’t dare classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. But in measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves to themselves, they lack understanding. "},{"num":13,"verse":"We, however, will not boast beyond measure but according to the measure of the area of ministry that God has assigned to us, which reaches even to you. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, since we have come to you with the gospel of Christ. "},{"num":15,"verse":"We are not boasting beyond measure about other people’s labors. On the contrary, we have the hope that as your faith increases, our area of ministry will be greatly enlarged, "},{"num":16,"verse":"so that we may preach the gospel to the regions beyond you without boasting about what has already been done in someone else’s area of ministry. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord. "},{"num":18,"verse":"For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one the Lord commends."}]
