"},{"num":2,"verse":"I pray that, when I arrive there, I may not have to be bold with the confidence that I expect to use in daring to confront some who think that we walk in the way the sinful flesh does. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For even though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war in the way the sinful flesh does. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Certainly, the weapons of our warfare are not those of the flesh, but weapons made powerful by God for tearing down strongholds. We tear down thoughts "},{"num":5,"verse":"such as all arrogance that rises up against the knowledge of God, and we make every thought captive so that it is obedient to Christ.
