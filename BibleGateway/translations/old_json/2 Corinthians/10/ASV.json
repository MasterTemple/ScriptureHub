[{"num":10,"verse":"Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you: "},{"num":2,"verse":"yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh "},{"num":4,"verse":"(for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds); "},{"num":5,"verse":"casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ; "},{"num":6,"verse":"and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be made full. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Ye look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also are we.
