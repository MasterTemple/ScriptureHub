[{"header":"Paul’s Apostolic Authority"},{"num":10,"verse":"Now I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the gentleness and graciousness of Christ—I who am humble among you in person but bold toward you when absent. "},{"num":2,"verse":"I beg you that when I am present I will not need to be bold with the confidence by which I plan to challenge certain people who think we are behaving in an unspiritual way. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For though we live in the body, we do not wage war in an unspiritual way, "},{"num":4,"verse":"since the weapons of our warfare are not worldly, but are powerful through God for the demolition of strongholds. We demolish arguments "},{"num":5,"verse":"and every high-minded thing that is raised up against the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive to obey Christ. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And we are ready to punish any disobedience, once your obedience has been confirmed."},{"num":7,"verse":"Look at what is obvious. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: Just as he belongs to Christ, so do we.

"},{"num":9,"verse":"I don’t want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"We, however, will not boast beyond measure but according to the measure of the area of ministry that God has assigned to us, which reaches even to you. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, since we have come to you with the gospel of Christ. "},{"num":15,"verse":"We are not bragging beyond measure about other people’s labors. But we have the hope that as your faith increases, our area of ministry will be greatly enlarged, "},{"num":16,"verse":"so that we may proclaim the good news to the regions beyond you, not boasting about what has already been done in someone else’s area of ministry. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So the one who boasts must boast in the Lord. "},{"num":18,"verse":"For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one the Lord commends."}]
