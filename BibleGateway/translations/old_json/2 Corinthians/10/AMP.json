[{"header":"Paul Describes Himself"},{"num":10,"verse":"Now I, Paul, urge you by the gentleness and graciousness of Christ—I who am meek [so they say] when with you face to face, but bold [outspoken and fearless] toward you when absent! "},{"num":2,"verse":"I ask that when I do come I will not be driven to the boldness that I intend to show toward those few who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh [like men without the Spirit]. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For though we walk in the flesh [as mortal men], we are not carrying on our [spiritual] warfare according to the flesh and using the weapons of man. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The weapons of our warfare are not physical [weapons of flesh and blood]. Our weapons are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. "},{"num":5,"verse":"We are destroying sophisticated arguments and every exalted and proud thing that sets itself up against the [true] knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought and purpose captive to the obedience of Christ, "},{"num":6,"verse":"being ready to punish every act of disobedience, when your own obedience [as a church] is complete."},{"num":7,"verse":"You are looking [only] at the outward appearance of things. If anyone is confident that he is Christ’s, he should reflect and consider this, that just as he is Christ’s, so too are we. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For even though I boast rather freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be ashamed [of the truth], "},{"num":9,"verse":"nor do I want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters; "},{"num":10,"verse":"for they say, “His letters are weighty and forceful and impressive, but his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible [of no account].” "},{"num":11,"verse":"Let such people realize that what we say by word in letters when we are absent, is the same as what we are in action when present."},{"num":12,"verse":"We do not have the audacity to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with some who [supply testimonials to] commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they lack wisdom and behave like fools.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"We are not overstepping the limits of our province, as if we did not [legitimately] reach to you, for we were the [very] first to come even as far as you with the good news of Christ. "},{"num":15,"verse":"We do not go beyond our proper limit, boasting in the work of other men, but we have the hope that as your faith [in Christ and His divine power] continues to grow, our field among you may be greatly expanded [but still within the limits of our commission], "},{"num":16,"verse":"so that we may preach the gospel even in the lands beyond you, but not to boast in work already accomplished in another one’s field of activity.
