"},{"num":2,"verse":"Please, please don’t put me in the position of having to be bold when I’m with you, of having to show how confident I dare to be when I’m standing up to people who think we are behaving in a merely human way. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Yes, we are mere humans, but we don’t fight the war in a merely human way. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The weapons we use for the fight, you see, are not merely human; they carry a power from God that can tear down fortresses! We tear down clever arguments, "},{"num":5,"verse":"and every proud notion that sets itself up against the knowledge of God. We take every thought prisoner and make it obey the Messiah.
