"},{"num":5,"verse":"Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me."},{"header":"The Thorn in the Flesh"},{"num":7,"verse":"And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
