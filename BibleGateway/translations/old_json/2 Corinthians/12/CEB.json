I’m holding back from bragging so that no one will give me any more credit than what anyone sees or hears about me."},{"num":7,"verse":"I was given a thorn in my body because of the outstanding revelations I’ve received so that I wouldn’t be conceited.

Dear friends, everything is meant to build you up."},{"num":20,"verse":"I’m afraid that maybe when I come you will be different from the way I want you to be, and that I’ll be different from the way you want me to be.
