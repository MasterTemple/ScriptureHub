[{"header":"Paul’s Vision"},{"num":12,"verse":"It is necessary to boast, though nothing is gained by it; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. "},{"num":2,"verse":"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, [only] God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven. "},{"num":3,"verse":"And I know that such a man—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, [only] God knows— "},{"num":4,"verse":"was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words which man is not permitted to speak [words too sacred to tell]. "},{"num":5,"verse":"On behalf of such a man [and his experiences] I will boast; but in my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses. "},{"num":6,"verse":"If I wish to boast, I will not be foolish, because I will be speaking the truth. But I abstain [from it], so that no one will credit me with more than [is justified by what] he sees in me or hears from me."},{"header":"A Thorn in the Flesh"},{"num":7,"verse":"Because of the surpassing greatness and extraordinary nature of the revelations [which I received from God], for this reason, to keep me from thinking of myself as important, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, to torment and harass me—to keep me from exalting myself! "},{"num":8,"verse":"Concerning this I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might leave me; "},{"num":9,"verse":"but He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you [My lovingkindness and My mercy are more than enough—always available—regardless of the situation]; for [My] power is being perfected [and is completed and shows itself most effectively] in [your] weakness.” Therefore, I will all the more gladly boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ [may completely enfold me and] may dwell in me.

Actually I should have been commended by you [instead of being treated disdainfully], for I was not inferior to those super-apostles, even if I am nobody.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except [for the fact] that I did not burden you [with my financial support]? Forgive me [for doing you] this injustice!"},{"num":14,"verse":"Now for the third time I am ready to visit you. I will not burden you [financially], because I do not want what is yours [not your money or your possessions], but you. For children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
