[{"num":5,"verse":"For we know that when this tent we live in now is taken down—when we die and leave these bodies—we will have wonderful new bodies in heaven, homes that will be ours forevermore, made for us by God himself and not by human hands. "},{"num":2,"verse":"How weary we grow of our present bodies. That is why we look forward eagerly to the day when we shall have heavenly bodies that we shall put on like new clothes. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For we shall not be merely spirits without bodies. "},{"num":4,"verse":"These earthly bodies make us groan and sigh, but we wouldn’t like to think of dying and having no bodies at all. We want to slip into our new bodies so that these dying bodies will, as it were, be swallowed up by everlasting life. "},{"num":5,"verse":"This is what God has prepared for us, and as a guarantee he has given us his Holy Spirit."},{"num":6,"verse":"Now we look forward with confidence to our heavenly bodies, realizing that every moment we spend in these earthly bodies is time spent away from our eternal home in heaven with Jesus. "},{"num":7,"verse":"We know these things are true by believing, not by seeing. "},{"num":8,"verse":"And we are not afraid but are quite content to die, for then we will be at home with the Lord. "},{"num":9,"verse":"So our aim is to please him always in everything we do, whether we are here in this body or away from this body and with him in heaven. "},{"num":10,"verse":"For we must all stand before Christ to be judged and have our lives laid bare—before him. Each of us will receive whatever he deserves for the good or bad things he has done in his earthly body."},{"num":11,"verse":"It is because of this solemn fear of the Lord, which is ever present in our minds, that we work so hard to win others. God knows our hearts, that they are pure in this matter, and I hope that, deep within, you really know it too."},{"num":12,"verse":"Are we trying to pat ourselves on the back again? No, I am giving you some good ammunition! You can use this on those preachers of yours who brag about how well they look and preach but don’t have true and honest hearts. You can boast about us that we, at least, are well intentioned and honest."},{"num":13,"verse":"Are we insane to say such things about ourselves? If so, it is to bring glory to God. And if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit. Whatever we do, it is certainly not for our own profit but because Christ’s love controls us now. Since we believe that Christ died for all of us, we should also believe that we have died to the old life we used to live. "},{"num":15,"verse":"He died for all so that all who live—having received eternal life from him—might live no longer for themselves, to please themselves, but to spend their lives pleasing Christ who died and rose again for them. "},{"num":16,"verse":"So stop evaluating Christians by what the world thinks about them or by what they seem to be like on the outside. Once I mistakenly thought of Christ that way, merely as a human being like myself. How differently I feel now! "},{"num":17,"verse":"When someone becomes a Christian, he becomes a brand new person inside. He is not the same anymore. A new life has begun!"},{"num":18,"verse":"All these new things are from God who brought us back to himself through what Christ Jesus did. And God has given us the privilege of urging everyone to come into his favor and be reconciled to him. "},{"num":19,"verse":"For God was in Christ, restoring the world to himself, no longer counting men’s sins against them but blotting them out. This is the wonderful message he has given us to tell others. "},{"num":20,"verse":"We are Christ’s ambassadors. God is using us to speak to you: we beg you, as though Christ himself were here pleading with you, receive the love he offers you—be reconciled to God. "},{"num":21,"verse":"For God took the sinless Christ and poured into him our sins. Then, in exchange, he poured God’s goodness into us!"}]
