[{"num":5,"verse":"We know surely that if our earthly abode, the tabernacle we now dwell in, were destroyed, we have an abode prepared by God: a habitation not made with hands, but eternal in heaven. "},{"num":2,"verse":"And for this we sigh, desiring to be clothed with our dwelling which is from heaven – "},{"num":3,"verse":"if yet we be found clothed, and not naked. "},{"num":4,"verse":"For as long as we are in this tabernacle, we sigh and are grieved. For we would not be unclothed, but would be clothed upon, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life."},{"num":5,"verse":"He who has ordained us for this thing is God, the very same who has given to us the earnest of the Spirit. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Therefore we are always of good cheer. And we know well that as long as we are at home in the body, we are away from God. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For we walk in faith, and see not. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Nevertheless, we are of good comfort – and yet would rather be away from the body, and be present with the Lord."},{"num":9,"verse":"And so whether we are at home or away from home, we endeavour to please him. "},{"num":10,"verse":"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that every person may receive the works of his body, according to what he has done, whether it be good or bad.

For we are known well enough to God."},{"num":12,"verse":"We are not praising ourselves again to you, but give you reason to have confidence in us, so that you may have something to answer to those who put confidence in the face, and not in the heart. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For if we are too fervent, it is for God that we are too fervent.
