[{"header":"Servants of the New Agreement"},{"num":3,"verse":"Are we starting to ·brag about [praise; commend] ourselves again?

"},{"num":3,"verse":"You show that you are a letter from Christ ·sent through us [delivered by us; or produced by us; the result of our ministry]. This letter is not written with ink but ·with [by] the Spirit of the living God. It is not written on stone tablets [the law of Moses was written on stone tablets; Ex. 24:12; 32:16] but on human hearts [hearts of flesh; Jer. 31:33; Ezek. 11:19; 36:26]."},{"num":4,"verse":"We can say this, because through Christ we ·feel certain before God [have confidence in God’s presence; or can trust in God].
