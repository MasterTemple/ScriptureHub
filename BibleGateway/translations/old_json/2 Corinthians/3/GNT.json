"},{"num":3,"verse":"It is clear that Christ himself wrote this letter and sent it by us. It is written, not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, and not on stone tablets but on human hearts."},{"num":4,"verse":"We say this because we have confidence in God through Christ. "},{"num":5,"verse":"There is nothing in us that allows us to claim that we are capable of doing this work. The capacity we have comes from God; "},{"num":6,"verse":"it is he who made us capable of serving the new covenant, which consists not of a written law but of the Spirit. The written law brings death, but the Spirit gives life."},{"num":7,"verse":"The Law was carved in letters on stone tablets, and God's glory appeared when it was given. Even though the brightness on Moses' face was fading, it was so strong that the people of Israel could not keep their eyes fixed on him.
