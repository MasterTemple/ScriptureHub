[{"header":"Generosity of the Churches"},{"num":8,"verse":"Beloved ones, we must tell you about the grace God poured out upon the churches of Macedonia. "},{"num":2,"verse":"For even during a season of severe difficulty, tremendous suffering, and extreme poverty, their super-abundant joy overflowed into an act of extravagant generosity. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For I can verify that they spontaneously gave, not only according to their means but far beyond what they could afford. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They actually begged us for the privilege of sharing in this ministry of giving to God’s holy people who are living in poverty. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They exceeded our expectations by first dedicating themselves fully to the Lord and then to us, according to God’s pleasure. "},{"num":6,"verse":"That is why we appealed to Titus, since he was the one who got you started and encouraged you to give, so he could help you complete this generous undertaking on your behalf.

So make sure that you also excel in grace-filled generosity."},{"num":8,"verse":"I’m not saying this as though I were issuing an order but to stir you to greater love by mentioning the enthusiasm of the Macedonians as a challenge to you.

Since you made such a good start last year, both in the grace of giving and in your longing to give, "},{"num":11,"verse":"you should finish what you started. You were so eager in your intentions to give, so go do it. Finish this act of worship according to your ability to give. "},{"num":12,"verse":"For if the intention and desire are there, the size of the gift doesn’t matter. Your gift is fully acceptable to God according to what you have, not what you don’t have. "},{"num":13,"verse":"I’m not saying this in order to ease someone else’s load by overloading you, but as a matter of fair balance.
