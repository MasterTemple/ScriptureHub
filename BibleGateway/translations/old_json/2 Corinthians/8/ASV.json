[{"num":8,"verse":"Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia; "},{"num":2,"verse":"how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord, "},{"num":4,"verse":"beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints: "},{"num":5,"verse":"and this, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.

"},{"num":11,"verse":"But now complete the doing also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.
