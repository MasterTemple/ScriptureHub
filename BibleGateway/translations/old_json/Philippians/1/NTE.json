[{"header":"Paul’s Reasons for Thanks"},{"num":1,"verse":"From Paul and Timothy, slaves of King Jesus, to all God’s holy ones in King Jesus who are in Philippi, together with the overseers and ministers: "},{"num":2,"verse":"grace to you and peace, from God our father and King Jesus the Lord."},{"num":3,"verse":"I thank my God every time I think of you! "},{"num":4,"verse":"I always pray with joy, whenever I pray for you all, "},{"num":5,"verse":"because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Of this I’m convinced: the one who began a good work in you will thoroughly complete it by the day of King Jesus."},{"num":7,"verse":"It’s right for me to think this way about all of you. You have me in your hearts, here in prison as I am, working to defend and bolster up the gospel. You are my partners in grace, all of you! "},{"num":8,"verse":"Yes: God can bear witness how much I’m longing for all of you with the deep love of King Jesus."},{"num":9,"verse":"And this is what I’m praying: that your love may overflow still more and more, in knowledge and in all astute wisdom. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then you will be able to tell the difference between good and evil, and be sincere and faultless on the day of the Messiah, "},{"num":11,"verse":"filled to overflowing with the fruit of right living, fruit that comes through King Jesus to God’s glory and praise."},{"header":"The King Is Proclaimed"},{"num":12,"verse":"Now, my dear family, I want you to know that the things I’ve been through have actually helped the gospel on its way. "},{"num":13,"verse":"You see, everybody in the Imperial Guard, and all the rest for that matter, have heard that I am here, chained up, because of the Messiah, the king. "},{"num":14,"verse":"My imprisonment has given new confidence to most of the Lord’s family; they are now much more prepared to speak the word boldly and fearlessly."},{"num":15,"verse":"There are some, I should say, who are proclaiming the king because of envy and rivalry; but there are others who are doing it out of good will. "},{"num":16,"verse":"These last are acting from love, since they know that I’m in prison because of defending the gospel; "},{"num":17,"verse":"but the others are announcing the king out of selfishness and jealousy. They are not acting from pure motives; they imagine that they will make more trouble for me in my captivity."},{"num":18,"verse":"So what? Only this: the king is being announced, whether people mean it or not! I’m happy to celebrate that!"},{"header":"To Live or to Die?"},{"num":19,"verse":"because I know that this will result in my rescue, through your prayer and the support of the spirit of King Jesus. "},{"num":20,"verse":"I’m waiting eagerly and full of hope, because nothing is going to put me to shame. I am going to be bold and outspoken, now as always, and the king is going to gain a great reputation through my body, whether in life or in death."},{"num":21,"verse":"You see, for me to live means the Messiah; to die means to make a profit. "},{"num":22,"verse":"If it’s to be living on in the flesh, that means fruitful work for me."},{"num":23,"verse":"I’m pulled both ways at once: I would really love to leave all this and be with the king, because that would be far better. "},{"num":24,"verse":"But staying on here in the flesh is more vital for your sake. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Since I’ve become convinced of this, I know that I will remain here, and stay alongside all of you, to help you to advance and rejoice in your faith, "},{"num":26,"verse":"so that the pride you take in King Jesus may overflow because of me, when I come to visit you once again."},{"header":"The Gospel in Public"},{"num":27,"verse":"The one thing I would stress is this: your public behaviour must match up to the gospel of the king. That way, whether I do come and see you or whether I remain elsewhere, the news that I get about you will indicate that you are standing firm with a single spirit, struggling side by side with one united intent for the faith of the gospel, "},{"num":28,"verse":"and not letting your opponents intimidate you in any way. This is a sign from God: one that signifies their destruction, but your salvation."},{"num":29,"verse":"Yes: God has granted you that, on behalf of the king, you should not only believe in him, but also suffer for his sake. "},{"num":30,"verse":"You are engaged in the same struggle which you once watched me go through; and, as you now hear, I’m still going through it."}]
