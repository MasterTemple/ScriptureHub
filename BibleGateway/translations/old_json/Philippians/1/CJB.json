[{"num":1,"verse":"From: Sha’ul and Timothy, slaves of the Messiah Yeshua"},{"num":2,"verse":"Grace to you and shalom from God our Father and the Lord Yeshua the Messiah."},{"num":3,"verse":"I thank my God every time I think of you. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Whenever I pray for all of you I always pray with joy, "},{"num":5,"verse":"because you have shared in proclaiming the Good News from the very first day until now. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And I am sure of this: that the One who began a good work among you will keep it growing until it is completed on the Day of the Messiah Yeshua. "},{"num":7,"verse":"It is right for me to think this way about you all, because I have you on my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and establishing the Good News, you are all sharing with me in this privileged work. "},{"num":8,"verse":"God can testify how I long for all of you with the deep affection of the Messiah Yeshua."},{"num":9,"verse":"And this is my prayer: that your love may more and more overflow in fullness of knowledge and depth of discernment, "},{"num":10,"verse":"so that you will be able to determine what is best and thus be pure and without blame for the Day of the Messiah, "},{"num":11,"verse":"filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Yeshua the Messiah — to the glory and praise of God."},{"num":12,"verse":"Now, brothers, I want you to know that what has happened to me has helped in advancing the Good News. "},{"num":13,"verse":"It has become clear to the whole palace and to everyone else that it is because of the Messiah that I am in chains. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Also, my being in prison has given most of the brothers in the Lord confidence, so that they have become much more bold in speaking the word of God fearlessly. "},{"num":15,"verse":"True, some are proclaiming the Messiah out of jealousy and rivalry, but others are doing it in goodwill. "},{"num":16,"verse":"The latter act from love, aware that I am put where I am for defending the Good News; "},{"num":17,"verse":"while the former announce the Messiah out of selfish ambition, with impure motives, supposing they can stir up trouble for me in prison. "},{"num":18,"verse":"But so what? All that matters is that in every way, whether honestly or in pretense, the Messiah is being proclaimed; and in that I rejoice."},{"num":19,"verse":"for I know that this will work out for my deliverance, because of your prayers and the support I get from the Spirit of Yeshua the Messiah. "},{"num":20,"verse":"It all accords with my earnest expectation and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of; but rather, now, as always, the Messiah will be honored by my body, whether it is alive or dead. "},{"num":21,"verse":"For to me, life is the Messiah, and death is gain. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But if by living on in the body I can do fruitful work, then I don’t know which to choose. "},{"num":23,"verse":"I am caught in a dilemma: my desire is to go off and be with the Messiah — that is better by far — "},{"num":24,"verse":"but because of you, the greater need is to stay on in the body. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Yes, I am convinced of this; so I know I will stay on with you in order to help you progress in the faith and have joy in it.
