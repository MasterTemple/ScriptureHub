"},{"num":3,"verse":"But the high places weren’t removed. The people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there."},{"num":4,"verse":"Joash spoke to the priests. He said, “Collect all the money the people bring as sacred offerings to the Lord’s temple. That includes the money collected when the men who are able to serve in the army are counted. It includes the money received from people who make a special promise to the Lord. It also includes the money people bring to the temple just because they want to. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Let each priest receive the money from one of the people in charge of the temple’s treasures. Then use all of that money to repair the temple where it needs it.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"It was now the 23rd year of the rule of King Joash. And the priests still hadn’t repaired the temple. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So the king sent for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests. He asked them, “Why aren’t you repairing the temple where it needs it? Don’t take any more money from the people in charge of the treasures. Instead, hand it over so the temple can be repaired.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"The priests agreed that they wouldn’t collect any more money from the people. They also agreed that they wouldn’t repair the temple themselves."},{"num":9,"verse":"Jehoiada the priest got a chest. He drilled a hole in its lid.

They paid the builders and those who worked with wood. "},{"num":12,"verse":"They paid those who cut stones and those who laid them. They bought lumber and blocks of stone. So they used the money to repair the Lord’s temple. They also paid all the other costs to make the temple like new again."},{"num":13,"verse":"The money the people brought to the Lord’s temple wasn’t used to make silver bowls. It wasn’t used for wick cutters, sprinkling bowls or trumpets. And it wasn’t used for any other things made out of gold or silver. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Instead, it was paid to the workers. They used it to repair the temple. "},{"num":15,"verse":"The royal secretary and the high priest didn’t require a report from those who were in charge of the work. That’s because they were completely honest. They always paid the workers. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Money was received from people who brought guilt offerings and sin offerings. But it wasn’t taken to the Lord’s temple. It belonged to the priests."},{"num":17,"verse":"About that time Hazael, the king of Aram, went up and attacked Gath. Then he captured it.

They had been set apart to the Lord by the kings who had ruled over Judah before him. Those kings were Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah. Joash took the gifts he himself had set apart. He took all the gold that was among the temple treasures. He also took all the gold from the royal palace. He sent all those things to Hazael, the king of Aram. Then Hazael pulled his army back from Jerusalem."},{"num":19,"verse":"The other events of the rule of Joash are written down. Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah. "},{"num":20,"verse":"The officials of Joash made evil plans against him. They killed him at Beth Millo.
