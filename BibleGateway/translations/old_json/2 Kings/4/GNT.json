[{"header":"Elisha Helps a Poor Widow"},{"num":4,"verse":"The widow of a member of a group of prophets went to Elisha and said, “Sir, my husband has died!

"},{"num":6,"verse":"When they had filled all the jars, she asked if there were any more. “That was the last one,” one of her sons answered. And the olive oil stopped flowing.

When she came, "},{"num":13,"verse":"he said to Gehazi, “Ask her what I can do for her in return for all the trouble she has had in providing for our needs.

She came and stood in the doorway, "},{"num":16,"verse":"and Elisha said to her, “By this time next year you will be holding a son in your arms.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"But, as Elisha had said, at about that time the following year she gave birth to a son."},{"num":18,"verse":"Some years later, at harvest time, the boy went out one morning to join his father, who was in the field with the harvest workers.

Didn't I tell you not to get my hopes up?”"},{"num":29,"verse":"Elisha turned to Gehazi and said, “Hurry! Take my walking stick and go. Don't stop to greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, don't take time to answer. Go straight to the house and hold my stick over the boy.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"The woman said to Elisha, “I swear by my loyalty to the living Lord and to you that I will not leave you!” So the two of them started back together.

He found a wild vine and picked as many gourds as he could carry. He brought them back and sliced them up into the stew, not knowing what they were.
