[{"header":"Naaman’s Tza’arat"},{"num":5,"verse":"Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master’s sight and highly esteemed, because through him Adonai had given victory to Aram. Though the man was a mighty man of valor, he had tza’arat."},{"num":2,"verse":"Aram had gone out in bands, and had taken captive a young girl from the land of Israel. So she served Naaman’s wife. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Then she said to her mistress, “If only my lord went before the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his tza’arat.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"So Naaman went in and told his master, saying, “Thus and thus spoke the girl who is from the land of Israel.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"The king of Aram said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So he departed and took with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothes."},{"num":6,"verse":"He brought the letter to the king of Israel saying, “When this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent my servant Naaman to you, so you may cure him of his tza’arat.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Now when the king of Israel read the letter, he ripped his clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man is sending to me to cure a man of his tza’arat? But please consider, and see how he is seeking a pretext against me.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Now when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent word to the king saying, “Why have you rent your clothes? Please, let him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So Naaman came with his horses and his chariots, and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha. "},{"num":10,"verse":"So Elisha sent him a messenger, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"But Naaman was angered and walked away, saying, “I thought he would surely come out to me, stand and call on the Name of Adonai his God, and wave his hand over the spot and cure the tza’arat. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Aren’t Amanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage."},{"num":13,"verse":"But his servants approached him and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he told you only to ‘Wash and be clean’?” "},{"num":14,"verse":"So, he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God.
