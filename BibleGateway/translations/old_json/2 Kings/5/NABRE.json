Take note! You can see he is only looking for a quarrel with me!” "},{"num":8,"verse":"When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his garments, he sent word to the king: “Why have you torn your garments? Let him come to me and find out that there is a prophet in Israel.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Naaman came with his horses and chariot and stopped at the door of Elisha’s house. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Elisha sent him the message: “Go and wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will heal, and you will be clean.” "},{"num":11,"verse":"But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand there to call on the name of the Lord his God, and would move his hand over the place, and thus cure the leprous spot.
