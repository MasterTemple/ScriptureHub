"},{"num":4,"verse":"He removed the high places, smashed the standing-stones, cut down the asherah and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moshe had made; because in those days the people of Isra’el were making offerings to it, calling it N’chushtan.* "},{"num":5,"verse":"He put his trust in Adonai the God of Isra’el; after him there was no one like him among all the kings of Y’hudah, nor had there been among those before him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For he clung to Adonai and did not leave off following him, but obeyed his mitzvot, which Adonai had given Moshe. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So Adonai was with him.
