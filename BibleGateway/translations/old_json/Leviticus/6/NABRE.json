[{"header":"B. Instructions for the Priests"},{"header":"Chapter 6"},{"num":1,"verse":"The Daily Burnt Offering. The Lord said to Moses: "},{"num":2,"verse":"Give Aaron and his sons the following command: This is the ritual for the burnt offering—the burnt offering that is to remain on the hearth of the altar all night until the next morning, while the fire is kept burning on the altar. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The priest, clothed in his linen robe and wearing linen pants underneath, shall take away the ashes to which the fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar, and lay them at the side of the altar. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then, having taken off these garments and put on other garments, he shall carry the ashes to a clean place outside the camp. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The fire on the altar is to be kept burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest shall put firewood on it. On this he shall lay out the burnt offering and burn the fat of the communion offering. "},{"num":6,"verse":"The fire is to be kept burning continuously on the altar; it must not go out."},{"num":7,"verse":"This is the ritual of the grain offering. Aaron’s sons shall offer it before the Lord, in front of the altar. "},{"num":8,"verse":"A priest shall then take from the grain offering a handful of bran flour and oil, together with all the frankincense that is on it, and this he shall burn on the altar as a token of the offering, a sweet aroma to the Lord.

"},{"num":10,"verse":"It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it to them as their portion from the oblations for the Lord; it is most holy, like the purification offering and the reparation offering. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Every male of Aaron’s descendants may eat of it perpetually throughout your generations as their rightful due from the oblations for the Lord. Whatever touches the oblations becomes holy."},{"num":12,"verse":"The Lord said to Moses: "},{"num":13,"verse":"This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall present to the Lord on the day he is anointed: one tenth of an ephah of bran flour for the regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. "},{"num":14,"verse":"You shall bring it well kneaded and fried in oil on a griddle. Having broken the offering into pieces, you shall present it as a sweet aroma to the Lord.

At the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, there also, before the Lord, shall the purification offering be slaughtered. It is most holy.
