If it is the anointed priest who thus does wrong and thereby makes the people guilty, he shall offer to the Lord an unblemished bull of the herd as a purification offering for the wrong he committed. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Bringing the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the Lord, he shall lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the Lord. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The anointed priest shall then take some of the bull’s blood and bring it into the tent of meeting, "},{"num":6,"verse":"where, dipping his finger in the blood, he shall sprinkle some of it seven times before the Lord, toward the veil of the sanctuary. "},{"num":7,"verse":"The priest shall also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense which stands before the Lord in the tent of meeting. The rest of the bull’s blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar for burnt offerings which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. "},{"num":8,"verse":"He shall remove all the fat of the bull of the purification offering: the fat that covers the inner organs, and all the fat that adheres to them, "},{"num":9,"verse":"as well as the two kidneys, with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which is removed with the kidneys, "},{"num":10,"verse":"just as the fat pieces are removed from the ox of the communion sacrifice. The priest shall burn these on the altar for burnt offerings.

At the place of the ash heap, there it must be burned."},{"num":13,"verse":"For the Community. If the whole community of Israel errs inadvertently and without even being aware of it violates any of the Lord’s prohibitions, and thus are guilty, "},{"num":14,"verse":"when the wrong that was committed becomes known, the community shall offer a bull of the herd as a purification offering.
