Then what can we say? Can we say that God is not fair when he brings his anger down on us? As you can tell, I am just using human ways of thinking. "},{"num":6,"verse":"God is certainly fair! If he weren’t, how could he judge the world? "},{"num":7,"verse":"Someone might argue, “When I lie, it becomes clearer that God is truthful. It makes his glory shine more brightly. Why then does he find me guilty of sin?” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Why not say, “Let’s do evil things so that good things will happen”? Some people actually lie by reporting that this is what we say.
