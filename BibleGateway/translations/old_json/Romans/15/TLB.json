[{"num":1,"verse":"Even if we believe that it makes no difference to the Lord whether we do these things, still we cannot just go ahead and do them to please ourselves; for we must bear the “burden” of being considerate of the doubts and fears of others—of those who feel these things are wrong. Let’s please the other fellow, not ourselves, and do what is for his good and thus build him up in the Lord. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Christ didn’t please himself. As the Psalmist said, “He came for the very purpose of suffering under the insults of those who were against the Lord.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"These things that were written in the Scriptures so long ago are to teach us patience and to encourage us so that we will look forward expectantly to the time when God will conquer sin and death."},{"num":5,"verse":"May God who gives patience, steadiness, and encouragement help you to live in complete harmony with each other—each with the attitude of Christ toward the other. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And then all of us can praise the Lord together with one voice, giving glory to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"num":7,"verse":"So warmly welcome each other into the church, just as Christ has warmly welcomed you; then God will be glorified. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Remember that Jesus Christ came to show that God is true to his promises and to help the Jews. "},{"num":9,"verse":"And remember that he came also that the Gentiles might be saved and give glory to God for his mercies to them. That is what the psalmist meant when he wrote: “I will praise you among the Gentiles and sing to your name.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"And in another place, “Be glad, O you Gentiles, along with his people the Jews.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"And yet again, “Praise the Lord, O you Gentiles; let everyone praise him.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"And the prophet Isaiah said, “There shall be an Heir in the house of Jesse, and he will be King over the Gentiles; they will pin their hopes on him alone.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"So I pray for you Gentiles that God who gives you hope will keep you happy and full of peace as you believe in him. I pray that God will help you overflow with hope in him through the Holy Spirit’s power within you."},{"num":14,"verse":"I know that you are wise and good, my brothers, and that you know these things so well that you are able to teach others all about them. "},{"num":15,"verse":"But even so I have been bold enough to emphasize some of these points, knowing that all you need is this reminder from me; for I am, by God’s grace, a special messenger from Jesus Christ to you Gentiles, bringing you the Gospel and offering you up as a fragrant sacrifice to God; for you have been made pure and pleasing to him by the Holy Spirit. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So it is right for me to be a little proud of all Christ Jesus has done through me. "},{"num":18,"verse":"I dare not judge how effectively he has used others, but I know this: he has used me to win the Gentiles to God. "},{"num":19,"verse":"I have won them by my message and by the good way I have lived before them and by the miracles done through me as signs from God—all by the Holy Spirit’s power. In this way I have preached the full Gospel of Christ all the way from Jerusalem clear over into Illyricum."},{"num":20,"verse":"But all the while my ambition has been to go still farther, preaching where the name of Christ has never yet been heard, rather than where a church has already been started by someone else. "},{"num":21,"verse":"I have been following the plan spoken of in the Scriptures where Isaiah says that those who have never heard the name of Christ before will see and understand. "},{"num":22,"verse":"In fact, that is the very reason I have been so long in coming to visit you."},{"num":23,"verse":"But now at last I am through with my work here, and I am ready to come after all these long years of waiting. "},{"num":24,"verse":"For I am planning to take a trip to Spain, and when I do, I will stop off there in Rome; and after we have had a good time together for a little while, you can send me on my way again."},{"num":25,"verse":"But before I come, I must go down to Jerusalem to take a gift to the Jewish Christians there. "},{"num":26,"verse":"For you see, the Christians in Macedonia and Achaia have taken up an offering for those in Jerusalem who are going through such hard times. "},{"num":27,"verse":"They were very glad to do this, for they feel that they owe a real debt to the Jerusalem Christians. Why? Because the news about Christ came to these Gentiles from the church in Jerusalem. And since they received this wonderful spiritual gift of the Gospel from there, they feel that the least they can do in return is to give some material aid. "},{"num":28,"verse":"As soon as I have delivered this money and completed this good deed of theirs, I will come to see you on my way to Spain. "},{"num":29,"verse":"And I am sure that when I come the Lord will give me a great blessing for you."},{"num":30,"verse":"Will you be my prayer partners? For the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake and because of your love for me—given to you by the Holy Spirit—pray much with me for my work. "},{"num":31,"verse":"Pray that I will be protected in Jerusalem from those who are not Christians. Pray also that the Christians there will be willing to accept the money I am bringing them. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Then I will be able to come to you with a happy heart by the will of God, and we can refresh each other."},{"num":33,"verse":"And now may our God, who gives peace, be with you all. Amen."}]
