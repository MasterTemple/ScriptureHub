"},{"num":5,"verse":"And may God, the source of encouragement and patience, give you the same attitude among yourselves as the Messiah Yeshua had, "},{"num":6,"verse":"so that with one accord and with one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah."},{"num":7,"verse":"So welcome each other, just as the Messiah has welcomed you into God’s glory.
