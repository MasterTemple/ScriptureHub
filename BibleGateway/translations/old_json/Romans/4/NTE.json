"},{"num":5,"verse":"But if someone doesn’t ‘work’, but simply believes in the one who declares the ungodly to be in the right, that person’s faith is calculated in their favour, putting them in the right."},{"num":6,"verse":"We see the same thing when David speaks of the blessing that comes to someone whom God calculates to be in the right apart from works:"},{"header":"Abraham the Father of Both Uncircumcised and Circumcised"},{"num":9,"verse":"So, then, does this blessing come on circumcised people or on uncircumcised? This is the passage we quoted: ‘His faith was calculated to Abraham as indicating that he was in the right.’ "},{"num":10,"verse":"How was it calculated? When he was circumcised or when he was uncircumcised? It wasn’t when he was circumcised; it was when he was uncircumcised! "},{"num":11,"verse":"He received circumcision as a sign and seal of the status of covenant membership, on the basis of faith, which he had when he was still uncircumcised. This was so that he could be the father of all who believe even when uncircumcised, so that the status of covenant membership can be calculated to their account as well.

It came through the covenant justice of faith. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For if those who belong to the law are going to inherit, then faith is empty, and the promise has been abolished.
