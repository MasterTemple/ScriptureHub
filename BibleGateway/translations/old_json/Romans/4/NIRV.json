"},{"num":2,"verse":"Did he become right with God because of something he did? If so, he could brag about it. But he couldn’t brag to God. "},{"num":3,"verse":"What do we find in Scripture? It says, “Abraham believed God. God accepted Abraham’s faith, and so his faith made him right with God.” (Genesis 15:6)"},{"num":4,"verse":"When a person works, their pay is not considered a gift. It is owed to them. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But things are different with God. He makes ungodly people right with himself. If people trust in him, their faith is accepted even though they do not work. Their faith makes them right with God. "},{"num":6,"verse":"King David says the same thing. He tells us how blessed people are when God makes them right with himself. They are blessed because they don’t have to do anything in return. David says,"},{"num":9,"verse":"Is that blessing only for those who are circumcised? Or is it also for those who are not circumcised? We have been saying that God accepted Abraham’s faith. So his faith made him right with God. "},{"num":10,"verse":"When did it happen? Was it after Abraham was circumcised, or before? It was before he was circumcised, not after! "},{"num":11,"verse":"He was circumcised as a sign of the covenant God had made with him.

So their faith makes them right with him. "},{"num":12,"verse":"And Abraham is also the father of those who are circumcised and believe. So just being circumcised is not enough.

Where there is no law, the law can’t be broken."},{"num":16,"verse":"The promise is based on God’s grace. The promise comes by faith. All of Abraham’s children will certainly receive the promise.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"It is written, “I have made you a father of many nations.” (Genesis 17:5) God considers Abraham to be our father. The God that Abraham believed in gives life to the dead. Abraham’s God also creates things that did not exist before."},{"num":18,"verse":"When there was no reason for hope, Abraham believed because he had hope. He became the father of many nations, exactly as God had promised. God said, “That is how many children you will have.” (Genesis 15:5) "},{"num":19,"verse":"Abraham did not become weak in his faith. He accepted the fact that he was past the time when he could have children. At that time Abraham was about 100 years old. He also realized that Sarah was too old to have children.
