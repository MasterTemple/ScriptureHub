[{"num":4,"verse":"What about Abraham, our early father? What did he learn? "},{"num":2,"verse":"If Abraham was made right with God by what he did, he would have had something to be proud of. But he could not be proud before God.

It is something he has earned. "},{"num":5,"verse":"If a man has not worked to be saved, but has put his trust in God Who saves men from the punishment of their sins, that man is made right with God because of his trust in God. "},{"num":6,"verse":"David tells of this. He spoke of how happy the man is who puts his trust in God without working to be saved from the punishment of sin. "},{"num":7,"verse":"“Those people are happy whose sinful acts are forgiven and whose sins are covered. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Those people are happy whose sins the Lord will not remember.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Is this happiness given to the Jews only? Or is it given also to the people who are not Jews?

Was it before or after Abraham went through the religious act of becoming a Jew? It was before. "},{"num":11,"verse":"He went through the religious act after he had put his trust in God. That religious act proved that his trust in God made him right with God even before he went through the religious act of becoming a Jew.

"},{"num":12,"verse":"He is also the early father of all those who have gone through the religious act of becoming a Jew. It is not because they went through the act.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"God promised to give the world to him and to all his family after him. He did not make this promise because Abraham obeyed the Law. He promised to give the world to Abraham because he put his trust in God. This made him right with God.

It is because of His loving-favor to us. It is for all the family of Abraham. It is for those who obey the Law. It is for those who put their trust in God as Abraham did. In this way, he is the father of all Christians. "},{"num":17,"verse":"The Holy Writings say, “I have made you a father of many nations.” This promise is good because of Who God is.
