[{"header":"God’s Coming Judgment Will Be Impartial, the Same for All"},{"num":2,"verse":"So you have no excuse – anyone, whoever you are, who sits in judgment! When you judge someone else, you condemn yourself, because you, who are behaving as a judge, are doing the same things. "},{"num":2,"verse":"God’s judgment falls, we know, in accordance with the truth, on those who do such things. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But if you judge those who do them and yet do them yourself, do you really suppose that you will escape God’s judgment?"},{"num":4,"verse":"Or do you despise the riches of God’s kindness, forbearance and patience? Don’t you know that God’s kindness is meant to bring you to repentance? "},{"num":5,"verse":"But by your hard, unrepentant heart you are building up a store of anger for yourself on the day of anger, the day when God’s just judgment will be unveiled – "},{"num":6,"verse":"the God who will ‘repay everyone according to their works’."},{"num":7,"verse":"When people patiently do what is good, and so pursue the quest for glory and honour and immortality, God will give them the life of the age to come.

It’s those who do the law who will be declared to be in the right!"},{"num":14,"verse":"This is how it works out. Gentiles don’t possess the law as their birthright; but whenever they do what the law says, they are a law for themselves, despite not possessing the law. "},{"num":15,"verse":"They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts. Their conscience bears witness as well, and their thoughts will run this way and that, sometimes accusing them and sometimes excusing, "},{"num":16,"verse":"on the day when (according to the gospel I proclaim) God judges all human secrets through King Jesus."},{"header":"The Claim of the Jew – and Its Problems"},{"num":17,"verse":"But supposing you call yourself a ‘Jew’.
