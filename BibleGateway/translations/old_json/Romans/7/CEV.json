[{"header":"An Example from Marriage"},{"num":7,"verse":"My friends, you surely understand enough about law to know that laws only have power over people who are alive.

However, if she goes off with another man while her husband is still alive, she is said to be unfaithful."},{"num":4,"verse":"That is how it is with you, my friends. You are now part of the body of Christ and are dead to the power of the Law. You are free to belong to Christ, who was raised to life so that we could serve God. "},{"num":5,"verse":"When we thought only of ourselves, the Law made us have sinful desires. It made every part of our bodies into slaves who are doomed to die.

Certainly not! But if it had not been for the Law, I would not have known what sin is really like. For example, I would not have known what it means to want something that belongs to someone else, unless the Law had told me not to do that.
