[{"num":8,"verse":"Therefore, [there is] now no condemnation (no adjudging guilty of wrong) for those who are in Christ Jesus, who live [and] walk not after the dictates of the flesh, but after the dictates of the Spirit."},{"num":2,"verse":"For the law of the Spirit of life [which is] in Christ Jesus [the law of our new being] has freed me from the law of sin and of death."},{"num":3,"verse":"For God has done what the Law could not do, [its power] being weakened by the flesh [the entire nature of man without the Holy Spirit].
