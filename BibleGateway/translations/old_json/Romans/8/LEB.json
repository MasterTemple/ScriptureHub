"},{"num":2,"verse":"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For what was impossible for the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, "},{"num":4,"verse":"in order that the requirement of the law would be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. "},{"num":5,"verse":"For those who are living according to the flesh are intent on the things of the flesh, but those who are living according to the Spirit are intent on the things of the Spirit. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace, "},{"num":7,"verse":"because the mindset of the flesh is enmity toward God, for it is not subjected to the law of God, for it is not able to do so, "},{"num":8,"verse":"and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God."},{"num":9,"verse":"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.
