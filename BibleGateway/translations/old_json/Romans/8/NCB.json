By sending his own Son in the likeness of our sinful nature as a sin offering, he condemned sin in the flesh"},{"num":4,"verse":"so that the righteous requirements of the Law might be fulfilled in us who live not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."},{"num":5,"verse":"Animated by the Spirit and Rendered Children of God.

What then can we say in response to all this? If God is for us, who can be against us?"},{"num":32,"verse":"He did not spare his own Son but gave him up for all of us.
