Because the law of the spirit of life in the Messiah, Jesus, released you from the law of sin and death."},{"num":3,"verse":"For God has done what the law (being weak because of human flesh) was incapable of doing. God sent his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and as a sin-offering; and, right there in the flesh, he condemned sin.
