And just as Christ was raised from death by the wonderful power of the Father, so we can now live a new life."},{"num":5,"verse":"Christ died, and we have been joined with him by dying too. So we will also be joined with him by rising from death as he did."},{"num":6,"verse":"We know that our old life was put to death on the cross with Christ. This happened so that our sinful selves would have no power over us. Then we would not be slaves to sin."},{"num":7,"verse":"Anyone who has died is made free from sin’s control."},{"num":8,"verse":"If we died with Christ, we know that we will also live with him."},{"num":9,"verse":"Christ was raised from death.

Certainly not!"},{"num":16,"verse":"Surely you know that you become the slaves of whatever you give yourselves to. Anything or anyone you follow will be your master.

In the past you offered the parts of your body to be slaves to your immoral and sinful thoughts. The result was that you lived only for sin. In the same way, you must now offer yourselves to be slaves to what is right. Then you will live only for God."},{"num":20,"verse":"In the past you were slaves to sin, and you did not even think about doing right."},{"num":21,"verse":"You did evil things, and now you are ashamed of what you did.
