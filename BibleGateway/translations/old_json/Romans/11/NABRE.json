For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. "},{"num":2,"verse":"God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? "},{"num":3,"verse":"“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"But what is God’s response to him? “I have left for myself seven thousand men who have not knelt to Baal.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"So also at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But if by grace, it is no longer because of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. "},{"num":7,"verse":"What then? What Israel was seeking it did not attain, but the elect attained it; the rest were hardened, "},{"num":8,"verse":"as it is written:"},{"num":9,"verse":"And David says:"},{"num":11,"verse":"The Gentiles’ Salvation. Hence I ask, did they stumble so as to fall? Of course not! But through their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make them jealous.

If you do boast, consider that you do not support the root; the root supports you.

They were broken off because of unbelief, but you are there because of faith. So do not become haughty, but stand in awe.
