[{"header":"Israel’s Rejection not Complete nor Final"},{"num":11,"verse":"So I ask, God has not rejected his people, has he? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. "},{"num":2,"verse":"God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew! Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? "},{"num":3,"verse":"“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left and they are seeking my life!” "},{"num":4,"verse":"But what was the divine response to him? “I have kept for myself 7,000 people who have not bent the knee to Baal.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace. "},{"num":7,"verse":"What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was diligently seeking, but the elect obtained it. The rest were hardened, "},{"num":8,"verse":"as it is written,"},{"num":9,"verse":"And David says,"},{"num":11,"verse":"I ask then, they did not stumble into an irrevocable fall, did they? Absolutely not! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Now if their transgression means riches for the world and their defeat means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration bring?"},{"num":13,"verse":"Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Seeing that I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, "},{"num":14,"verse":"if somehow I could provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them. "},{"num":15,"verse":"For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? "},{"num":16,"verse":"If the first portion of the dough offered is holy, then the whole batch is holy, and if the root is holy, so too are the branches."},{"num":17,"verse":"Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and participated in the richness of the olive root, "},{"num":18,"verse":"do not boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Then you will say, “The branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” "},{"num":20,"verse":"Granted! They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear! "},{"num":21,"verse":"For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Notice therefore the kindness and harshness of God—harshness toward those who have fallen, but God’s kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off. "},{"num":23,"verse":"And even they—if they do not continue in their unbelief—will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. "},{"num":24,"verse":"For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree?"},{"num":25,"verse":"For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: A partial hardening has happened to Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.

"},{"num":30,"verse":"Just as you were formerly disobedient to God, but have now received mercy due to their disobedience, "},{"num":31,"verse":"so they too have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy. "},{"num":32,"verse":"For God has consigned all people to disobedience so that he may show mercy to them all."},{"num":33,"verse":"Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how unfathomable his ways!"},{"num":36,"verse":"For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever! Amen."}]
