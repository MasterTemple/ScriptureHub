I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."},{"num":2,"verse":"God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. You surely must know what Scripture asserts in the passage about Elijah where he pleads with God against Israel:"},{"num":3,"verse":"“Lord, they have killed your Prophets, they have torn down your altars. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"What was God’s response to him? “I have spared for myself seven thousand men who have not knelt before Baal.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So too, at the present time, there is a remnant, chosen by grace."},{"num":6,"verse":"But if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace."},{"num":7,"verse":"What follows, then? Israel was unable to attain what it was seeking. The elect attained it, but the rest were hardened,"},{"num":8,"verse":"as it is written:"},{"num":9,"verse":"And David says:"},{"num":11,"verse":"A Providential Misstep. And so I ask: Have they stumbled so that they might fall? By no means! However, through their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, and this has stirred them to envy."},{"num":12,"verse":"Now if their transgression results in riches for the world, and their loss results in riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full participation bring!"},{"num":13,"verse":"Now I am addressing you Gentiles.
