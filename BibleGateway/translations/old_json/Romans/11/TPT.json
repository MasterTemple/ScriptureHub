Haven’t you heard Elijah’s testimony in the Scriptures, and how he prays to God, agonizing over Israel?"},{"num":3,"verse":"“Lord, they’ve murdered your prophets; they’ve demolished your altars. Now I’m the only one left and they want to kill me!”"},{"num":4,"verse":"But what was the revelation God spoke to him in response?"},{"num":5,"verse":"And that is but one example of what God is doing in this age of fulfillment, for God’s grace empowers his chosen remnant.

Certainly not! Rather, it was because of their stumble that salvation now extends to all the non-Jewish people, in order to make Israel jealous and desire the very things that God has freely given them.
