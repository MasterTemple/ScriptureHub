"},{"num":6,"verse":"His choice is based on his grace, not on what they have done. For if God's choice were based on what people do, then his grace would not be real grace."},{"num":7,"verse":"What then? The people of Israel did not find what they were looking for. It was only the small group that God chose who found it; the rest grew deaf to God's call.

By no means! Because they sinned, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make the Jews jealous of them.

They were broken off because they did not believe, while you remain in place because you do believe. But do not be proud of it; instead, be afraid.
