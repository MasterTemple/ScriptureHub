For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love."},{"num":6,"verse":"When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners."},{"num":7,"verse":"Now, most people would not be willing to die for an upright person, though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good."},{"num":8,"verse":"But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners."},{"num":9,"verse":"And since we have been made right in God’s sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God’s condemnation."},{"num":10,"verse":"For since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the life of his Son."},{"num":11,"verse":"So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of God."},{"header":"Adam and Christ Contrasted"},{"num":12,"verse":"When Adam sinned, sin entered the world.
