"},{"num":3,"verse":"And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness; "},{"num":4,"verse":"and stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope: "},{"num":5,"verse":"and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto us. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die.
