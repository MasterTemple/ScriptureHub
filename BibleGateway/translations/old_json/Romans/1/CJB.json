[{"num":1,"verse":"From: Sha’ul, a slave of the Messiah Yeshua, an emissary because I was called and set apart for the Good News of God."},{"num":2,"verse":"God promised this Good News in advance through his prophets in the Tanakh. "},{"num":3,"verse":"It concerns his Son — he is descended from David physically; "},{"num":4,"verse":"he was powerfully demonstrated to be Son of God spiritually, set apart by his having been resurrected from the dead; he is Yeshua the Messiah, our Lord. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Through him we received grace and were given the work of being an emissary on his behalf promoting trust-grounded obedience among all the Gentiles, "},{"num":6,"verse":"including you, who have been called by Yeshua the Messiah."},{"num":7,"verse":"To: All those in Rome whom God loves, who have been called, who have been set apart for him:"},{"num":8,"verse":"First, I thank my God through Yeshua the Messiah for all of you, because the report of your trust is spreading throughout the whole world. "},{"num":9,"verse":"For God, whom I serve in my spirit by spreading the Good News about his Son, is my witness that I regularly remember you "},{"num":10,"verse":"in my prayers; and I always pray that somehow, now or in the future, I might, by God’s will, succeed in coming to visit you. "},{"num":11,"verse":"For I long to see you, so that I might share with you some spiritual gift that can make you stronger — "},{"num":12,"verse":"or, to put it another way, so that by my being with you, we might, through the faith we share, encourage one another. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Brothers, I want you to know that although I have been prevented from visiting you until now, I have often planned to do so, in order that I might have some fruit among you, just as I have among the other Gentiles. "},{"num":14,"verse":"I owe a debt to both civilized Greeks and uncivilized people, to both the educated and the ignorant; "},{"num":15,"verse":"therefore I am eager to proclaim the Good News also to you who live in Rome."},{"num":16,"verse":"For I am not ashamed of the Good News, since it is God’s powerful means of bringing salvation to everyone who keeps on trusting, to the Jew especially, but equally to the Gentile. "},{"num":17,"verse":"For in it is revealed how God makes people righteous in his sight; and from beginning to end it is through trust — as the Tanakh puts it, “But the person who is righteous will live his life by trust.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"What is revealed is God’s anger from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people who in their wickedness keep suppressing the truth; "},{"num":19,"verse":"because what is known about God is plain to them, since God has made it plain to them. "},{"num":20,"verse":"For ever since the creation of the universe his invisible qualities — both his eternal power and his divine nature — have been clearly seen, because they can be understood from what he has made. Therefore, they have no excuse; "},{"num":21,"verse":"because, although they know who God is, they do not glorify him as God or thank him. On the contrary, they have become futile in their thinking; and their undiscerning hearts have become darkened. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Claiming to be wise, they have become fools! "},{"num":23,"verse":"In fact, they have exchanged the glory of the immortal God for mere images, like a mortal human being, or like birds, animals or reptiles!"},{"num":24,"verse":"This is why God has given them up to the vileness of their hearts’ lusts, to the shameful misuse of each other’s bodies.
