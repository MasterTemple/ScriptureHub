[{"header":"Daniel’s vision of a man"},{"num":10,"verse":"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war. The understanding of the message came to him in a vision."},{"num":2,"verse":"At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. "},{"num":3,"verse":"I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over."},{"num":4,"verse":"On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, "},{"num":5,"verse":"I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz round his waist.

"},{"num":8,"verse":"So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless.
