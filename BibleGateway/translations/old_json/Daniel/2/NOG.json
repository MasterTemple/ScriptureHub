So they came to the king."},{"num":3,"verse":"The king said to them, “I had a dream, and I’m troubled by it. I want to know what the dream was.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"The astrologers spoke to the king in Aramaic, “Your Majesty, may you live forever! Tell us the dream, and we’ll interpret it for you.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"The king answered the astrologers, “I meant what I said!

"},{"num":35,"verse":"Then all at once, the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were smashed. They became like husks on a threshing floor in summer. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a large mountain which filled the whole world. "},{"num":36,"verse":"This is the dream.

As iron crushes things, this fourth kingdom will smash and crush all the other kingdoms. "},{"num":41,"verse":"You also saw the feet and toes. They were partly potters’ clay and partly iron.
