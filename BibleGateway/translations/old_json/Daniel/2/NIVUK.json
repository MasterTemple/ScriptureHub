"},{"num":2,"verse":"So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king, "},{"num":3,"verse":"he said to them, ‘I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means.’"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the astrologers answered the king, ‘May the king live for ever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.’"},{"num":5,"verse":"The king replied to the astrologers, ‘This is what I have firmly decided: if you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honour. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.’"},{"num":7,"verse":"Once more they replied, ‘Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.’"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then the king answered, ‘I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realise that this is what I have firmly decided: "},{"num":9,"verse":"if you do not tell me the dream, there is only one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.’"},{"num":10,"verse":"The astrologers answered the king, ‘There is no one on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. "},{"num":11,"verse":"What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans.’"},{"num":12,"verse":"This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. "},{"num":13,"verse":"So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death."},{"num":14,"verse":"When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. "},{"num":15,"verse":"He asked the king’s officer, ‘Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?’ Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. "},{"num":16,"verse":"At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him."},{"num":17,"verse":"Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. "},{"num":18,"verse":"He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. "},{"num":19,"verse":"During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven "},{"num":20,"verse":"and said:"},{"header":"Daniel interprets the dream"},{"num":24,"verse":"Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, ‘Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.’"},{"num":25,"verse":"Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, ‘I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.’"},{"num":26,"verse":"The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), ‘Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?’"},{"num":27,"verse":"Daniel replied, ‘No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, "},{"num":28,"verse":"but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these:"},{"num":29,"verse":"‘As Your Majesty was lying there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. "},{"num":30,"verse":"As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind."},{"num":31,"verse":"‘Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue – an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. "},{"num":32,"verse":"The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, "},{"num":33,"verse":"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. "},{"num":34,"verse":"While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. "},{"num":35,"verse":"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing-floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth."},{"num":36,"verse":"‘This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. "},{"num":37,"verse":"Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; "},{"num":38,"verse":"in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold."},{"num":39,"verse":"‘After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.

"},{"num":47,"verse":"The king said to Daniel, ‘Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.’"},{"num":48,"verse":"Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.
