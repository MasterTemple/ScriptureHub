[{"num":1,"verse":"One night in the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had a terrifying nightmare and awoke trembling with fear. And to make matters worse, he couldn’t remember his dream! He immediately called in all his magicians, incantationists, sorcerers, and astrologers, and demanded that they tell him what his dream had been."},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the astrologers (speaking in Aramaic) said to the king, “Sir, tell us the dream and then we can tell you what it means.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"But the king replied, “I tell you the dream is gone—I can’t remember it. And if you won’t tell me what it was and what it means, I’ll have you torn limb from limb and your houses made into heaps of rubble! "},{"num":6,"verse":"But I will give you many wonderful gifts and honors if you tell me what the dream was and what it means. So, begin!”"},{"num":7,"verse":"They said again, “How can we tell you what the dream means unless you tell us what it was?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"The king retorted, “I can see your trick! You’re trying to stall for time until the calamity befalls me that the dream foretells. But if you don’t tell me the dream, you certainly can’t expect me to believe your interpretation!”"},{"num":10,"verse":"The astrologers replied to the king, “There isn’t a man alive who can tell others what they have dreamed! And there isn’t a king in all the world who would ask such a thing! "},{"num":11,"verse":"This is an impossible thing the king requires. No one except the gods can tell you your dream, and they are not here to help.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"Upon hearing this, the king was furious and sent out orders to execute all the wise men of Babylon. "},{"num":13,"verse":"And Daniel and his companions were rounded up with the others to be killed."},{"num":14,"verse":"But when Arioch, the chief executioner, came to kill them, Daniel handled the situation with great wisdom by asking, "},{"num":15,"verse":"“Why is the king so angry?

"},{"num":21,"verse":"World events are under his control. He removes kings and sets others on their thrones. He gives wise men their wisdom and scholars their intelligence.

"},{"num":30,"verse":"(But remember, it’s not because I am wiser than any living person that I know this secret of your dream, for God showed it to me for your benefit.)"},{"num":31,"verse":"“O king, you saw a huge and powerful statue of a man, shining brilliantly, frightening and terrible. "},{"num":32,"verse":"The head of the statue was made of purest gold, its chest and arms were of silver, its belly and thighs of brass, "},{"num":33,"verse":"its legs of iron, its feet part iron and part clay. "},{"num":34,"verse":"But as you watched, a Rock was cut from the mountainside by supernatural means. It came hurtling toward the statue and crushed the feet of iron and clay, smashing them to bits. "},{"num":35,"verse":"Then the whole statue collapsed into a heap of iron, clay, brass, silver, and gold; its pieces were crushed as small as chaff, and the wind blew them all away. But the Rock that knocked the statue down became a great mountain that covered the whole earth."},{"num":36,"verse":"“That was the dream; now for its meaning:"},{"num":37,"verse":"“Your Majesty, you are a king over many kings, for the God of heaven has given you your kingdom, power, strength, and glory.

"},{"num":43,"verse":"This mixture of iron with clay also shows that these kingdoms will try to strengthen themselves by forming alliances with each other through intermarriage of their rulers; but this will not succeed, for iron and clay don’t mix."},{"num":44,"verse":"“During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed; no one will ever conquer it. It will shatter all these kingdoms into nothingness, but it shall stand forever, indestructible.
