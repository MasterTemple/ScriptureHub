In the first year that Belshazzar was king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and experienced visions in his mind as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down his account of the dream as follows:"},{"num":2,"verse":"In the vision I saw during the night, I, Daniel, beheld the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea."},{"num":3,"verse":"Four huge beasts then emerged from the sea, each one different from the others."},{"num":4,"verse":"The first was like a lion, but with the wings of an eagle. As I watched, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet as if it were a human being. It was also given a human heart."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then a second beast appeared that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. The order was given to it: “Arise and gorge yourself with bodies.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"After this, as I watched, another beast appeared, like a leopard. On its back it had four wings like those of a bird, and it had four heads. This beast was given dominion."},{"num":7,"verse":"After this, in my night visions, I beheld a fourth beast terrifying, fearsome, and exceedingly strong. With its great iron teeth it devoured and crushed its victims, and it trampled their remains with its feet. It was different from all of the preceding beasts, and it had ten horns."},{"num":8,"verse":"While I was gazing up at these horns, I beheld another horn, a small one, sprouting in their midst. Three of the other horns were uprooted to make room for it. This horn had eyes like human eyes, and a mouth that spoke with arrogance."},{"num":11,"verse":"Then I continued to watch because of the arrogant words that the horn was speaking. And as I watched the beast was put to death. Its body was destroyed and thrown into the fire to be consumed."},{"num":12,"verse":"As for the other beasts, they lost their dominion, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time."},{"num":15,"verse":"The Kingdom of the Holy Ones of the Most High. I, Daniel, experienced great anguish of spirit, and the visions that flashed through my mind truly terrified me."},{"num":16,"verse":"Therefore, I approached one of those who were standing there and asked him what all this truly signified. He in turn revealed to me what all these things meant,"},{"num":17,"verse":"“These four great beasts represent four kingdoms that will arise from the earth."},{"num":18,"verse":"But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive kingly power and possess it forever and ever.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"Then I expressed my desire to know about the fourth beast, since it was different from all the rest, and terrifying to behold with its iron teeth and bronze claws, and trampling underfoot and devouring its victims."},{"num":20,"verse":"I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head, and why the other horn sprouted, before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and an arrogant mouth, and whose appearance was more imposing than that of the others."},{"num":21,"verse":"As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy ones and prevailing over them,"},{"num":22,"verse":"until the Ancient One came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy ones of the Most High, and the time came when the holy ones gained possession of the kingdom."},{"num":23,"verse":"This is the explanation he offered:"},{"num":28,"verse":"Here the account ends. I, Daniel, was greatly disturbed by my thoughts, and I turned pale, but I kept these things to myself."}]
