[{"header":"Daniel’s Vision of a Ram and a Goat[a]"},{"header":"Chapter 8"},{"num":1,"verse":"Vision of the Ram and He-Goat. In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, I, Daniel, had another vision subsequent to the first vision that I had previously experienced."},{"num":2,"verse":"In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam, standing by the Ulai canal."},{"num":3,"verse":"When I looked up, I saw a ram standing beside the river. It had two horns. Both of the horns were tall, but one was taller than the other, although the other had appeared first."},{"num":4,"verse":"I observed the ram butting toward the west, the north, and the south. No beast could withstand it or escape from its power. It did as it pleased and became very strong."},{"num":5,"verse":"As I was pondering this, a he-goat appeared from the west, skimming over the entire surface of the world without touching the ground, and between its eyes it had one prominent horn."},{"num":6,"verse":"It approached the two-horned ram, which I had seen standing by the river, and charged it with savage fury."},{"num":7,"verse":"I saw it charge the ram in a fit of rage and attack it with the full force of its fury, breaking both of its horns and leaving the ram powerless to withstand the attack. Having thrown the ram to the ground, it trampled it underfoot, and there was no one there to rescue the ram."},{"num":8,"verse":"The he-goat then grew even more powerful but at the height of its strength the great horn shattered, and in its place there came forth four majestic horns pointing toward the four winds of heaven."},{"num":9,"verse":"Out of one of these horns sprang forth a small horn which grew ever larger and poured forth its strength toward the south and the east and toward the beautiful land."},{"num":10,"verse":"It grew until it reached the host of heaven, after which it flung down to the earth some of the host as well as some of the stars and trampled on them."},{"num":11,"verse":"It even challenged arrogantly the power of the prince of the host. It abolished his right to offer the daily sacrifice and destroyed his sanctuary."},{"num":12,"verse":"The army, too, was abolished, while the daily sacrifice was replaced by sin. It cast truth to the ground and succeeded in everything it did."},{"num":13,"verse":"Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the speaker, “How long will it be before this vision is fulfilled—the vision of sacrifice, the desolation of transgressions, and daily trampling of the sanctuary and the host?”"},{"num":14,"verse":"The first one replied, “Until two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings have passed. Then the sanctuary will be purified.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"Interpretation of the Vision. While I, Daniel, tried to understand the vision that I had seen, I saw someone standing before me who had the appearance of a man."},{"num":16,"verse":"Then I heard a human voice from the Ulai cry out, “Gabriel, explain to him the meaning of the vision.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"As he then approached the place where I was standing, I fell prostrate in terror. However, he said to me, “Understand this, son of man. The vision refers to the end time.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"As he spoke to me, I fell to the ground in a trance, face downward. However, he touched me and raised me to my feet."},{"num":19,"verse":"“I will show you,” he said, “what will take place later in the period of wrath, for at the appointed time there will be an end."},{"num":20,"verse":"“The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia."},{"num":21,"verse":"The male goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes represents the first king."},{"num":22,"verse":"As for the horn that was broken and replaced by four other horns, four kingdoms shall rise from his nation but be lacking his power."},{"num":27,"verse":"Then I, Daniel, was overcome by exhaustion, and I lay sick for several days. After that I arose and attended to the king’s business. But I was perplexed by the vision, which I was unable to understand."}]
