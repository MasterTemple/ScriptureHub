[{"header":"Daniel’s Vision"},{"num":8,"verse":"·During [In] the third year of King Belshazzar’s rule [perhaps 547 bc], I, Daniel, saw another vision, ·which was like the first one [after the one that appeared to me in the beginning/previously; 7:1]. "},{"num":2,"verse":"In this vision I saw myself in the ·capital city [or fortress city] of Susa, in the ·area [province] of Elam. I was standing by the Ulai ·Canal [or Gate] "},{"num":3,"verse":"when I ·looked up and [lifted my eyes I] saw a ·male sheep [ram] standing beside the ·canal [or gate]. It had two long horns, but one horn was longer and ·newer than the other [came up second]. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I watched the ·sheep [ram] charge to the west, the north, and the south. No animal could stand before him, and none could ·save [protect] another animal from his ·power [hand]. He did whatever he ·wanted [pleased] and became very ·powerful [great; strong]."},{"num":5,"verse":"While I was ·watching this [or reflecting; pondering], I saw a male goat come from the west. This goat had ·one large horn between his eyes that was easy to see [a horn of vision; or a conspicuous horn between its eyes]. He crossed over the whole earth without touching the ground [because of its speed]."},{"num":6,"verse":"·In his anger [or With angry power] the goat ·charged [came up to] the ·sheep [ram] with the two horns that I had seen standing by the ·canal [or gate]. "},{"num":7,"verse":"I watched the angry goat ·attack [approach] the ·sheep [ram] and break the ·sheep’s [ram’s] two horns. The ·sheep [ram] ·was not strong enough to stop him [did not have the power/strength to stand before him]. The goat ·knocked [threw] the ·sheep [ram] to the ground and then ·walked all over him [trampled him]. No one was able to ·save [protect] the ·sheep [ram] from ·the goat [its power/hand], "},{"num":8,"verse":"so the male goat became very ·great [powerful; strong]. But when he was strong, his ·big [or conspicuous] horn broke off and four horns grew in place of the one big horn. Those four horns ·pointed in four different directions [were toward the four winds of heaven] and were ·easy to see [conspicuous]."},{"num":9,"verse":"Then ·a little horn grew from one of those four horns [from one of them came out another horn, a little one; 7:8], and it became very ·big [great]. It grew to the south, the east, and toward the beautiful land [Judah; Ezek. 20:6, 15]. "},{"num":10,"verse":"That ·little horn [it] grew ·until it reached to the sky [to the hosts of heaven; the angels and the stars]. It even threw some of the ·army of heaven [hosts and the stars] to the ground and ·walked on [trampled] them! "},{"num":11,"verse":"·That little horn [It] set itself up as equal to the prince of ·heaven’s armies [the hosts; God]. It ·stopped [abolished] the ·daily [regular] sacrifices [Ex. 29:38–41; Num. 28:3–8] that were offered to him, and the ·Temple, the place where people worshiped him, [place of the sanctuary] was ·pulled down [overthrown]. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Because there was a ·turning away from God [rebellion; transgression], the people stopped the ·daily [regular] sacrifices. Truth was thrown down to the ground, and ·the horn [it] was successful in everything it did."},{"num":13,"verse":"Then I heard ·a holy angel [one of the holy ones] speaking. Another ·holy angel [holy one] asked the first one, “How long will the things in this vision last—the ·daily [regular] sacrifices [8:12], the ·turning away from God [rebellion; transgression] that brings ·destruction [desolation], the ·Temple [sanctuary] being pulled down, and the ·army of heaven [host] being ·walked on [trampled]?”"},{"num":14,"verse":"The angel said to me, “This will happen for twenty-three hundred evenings and mornings [either 2,300 or 1,150 days]. Then the ·holy place [sanctuary] will be ·repaired [restored; made right again].”"},{"num":15,"verse":"I, Daniel, saw this vision and ·tried to understand what it meant [sought understanding]. I saw someone who looked like a man standing near me. "},{"num":16,"verse":"And I heard a man’s voice calling from the Ulai ·Canal [or Gate]: “Gabriel [an angel], explain the vision to this man.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"·Gabriel [He] came to where I was standing. When he came close to me, I was ·very afraid [terrified; or overwhelmed] and ·bowed facedown on the ground [fell on my face]. But ·Gabriel [he] said to me, “·Human being [Son of man], understand that this vision is about the time of the end.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"While ·Gabriel [he] was speaking, I fell into a ·deep sleep [trance] with my face on the ground. Then he touched me [strengthening him] and ·lifted me to my feet [made me stand in my place]. "},{"num":19,"verse":"He said, “Now, I will ·explain [make known; reveal] to you what will happen in the time of anger. Your vision was about the ·set [appointed] time of the end."},{"num":20,"verse":"“You saw a ·male sheep [ram] with two horns, which are the kings of Media and Persia. "},{"num":21,"verse":"The male goat is the king of ·Greece [Javan], and the big horn between its eyes is the first king [Alexander the Great, who defeated Persia around 330 bc]. "},{"num":22,"verse":"The four horns that grew in the place of the broken horn are four kingdoms [Alexander died in 323 bc and his four most powerful generals carved up his empire between them]. Those four kingdoms will come from ·the nation of the first king [his nation], but ·they will not be as strong as the first king [not with his power/strength]."},{"num":23,"verse":"“When the end comes near for those kingdoms, a ·bold and cruel [fierce/stern-faced] king who ·tells lies will come [understands riddles/enigmas; Antiochus Epiphanes, who terrorized the Jews in the mid-second century bc]. This will happen when ·many people have turned against God [rebellions/transgressions will reach their height]. "},{"num":24,"verse":"·This king will be very powerful [His power will be strong], but ·his power will not come from himself [not his own power]. He will cause ·terrible [fearful] destruction and will be successful in everything he does. He will destroy powerful people and even ·God’s holy people [the people of the holy ones]. "},{"num":25,"verse":"This king will succeed by using ·lies and force [the deceit in his hand/power]. He will ·think that he is very important [be great in his heart]. He will destroy many people ·without warning [or with ease]; he will ·try to fight [stand against] even the Prince of princes! But ·that cruel king [he] will be ·destroyed [broken], and not by human ·power [hand]."},{"num":26,"verse":"“The vision that has been shown to you about these evenings and mornings is true. But seal up the vision, because ·those things won’t happen for a long time [it concerns many days from now].”"},{"num":27,"verse":"I, Daniel, became very weak and was sick for ·several days after that vision [some days]. Then I got up and went back to work for the king, but I was very ·upset [dismayed; perplexed] about the vision. I didn’t understand what it meant."}]
