"},{"num":3,"verse":"I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the river. It had two horns; and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward; no beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power; he did as he pleased and magnified himself."},{"num":5,"verse":"As I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.

But he said to me, “Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"As he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and set me on my feet.
