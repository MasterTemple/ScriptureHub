[{"header":"Daniel's Vision of the Ram and the Goat"},{"num":8,"verse":"In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first."},{"num":2,"verse":"And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the capital, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was at the Ulai canal."},{"num":3,"verse":"I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last."},{"num":4,"verse":"I saw the ram charging westwards and northwards and southwards. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power.

Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state.”"},{"header":"The Interpretation of the Vision"},{"num":15,"verse":"When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it.

And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, “Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground.

Without warning he shall destroy many. And he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken—but by no human hand."},{"num":26,"verse":"The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true, but seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king's business, but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it."}]
