[{"header":"Daniel and the Lions"},{"num":6,"verse":"·Darius thought it would be a good idea [It pleased Darius; 5:30] to ·choose [set over the kingdom] one hundred twenty ·governors [satraps] who would ·rule his [be over the] kingdom. "},{"num":2,"verse":"He chose three men as ·supervisors [presidents; heads] over those ·governors [satraps], and Daniel was one of the ·supervisors [presidents; heads]. The ·supervisors [presidents; heads] were to ensure that the ·governors did not try to cheat the king [king would not be troubled/disturbed]. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Daniel ·showed that he could do the work better than [distinguished himself above] the other ·supervisors [presidents; heads] and ·governors [satraps] because an ·excellent [extraordinary] spirit was in him, so the king planned to put Daniel in charge of the whole kingdom. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Because of this, the other ·supervisors [presidents; heads] and ·governors [satraps] tried to find reasons to accuse Daniel ·about his work in the government [in regard to the kingdom]. But they could not find anything ·wrong with him or any reason to accuse him [in regard to complaint or corruption], because he was trustworthy and not lazy or ·dishonest [corrupt]. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Finally these men said, “We will never find any reason to accuse Daniel unless it is about the law of his God.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So the ·supervisors [presidents; heads] and ·governors [satraps] ·went as a group to [or conspired against] the king and said: “King Darius, live forever! "},{"num":7,"verse":"The ·supervisors [presidents; heads], ·assistant governors [prefects], ·governors [satraps], ·the people who advise you [counselors], and the ·captains of the soldiers [governors] have ·all agreed [taken counsel] that you should ·make a new law [issue a decree] ·for everyone to obey [and enforce an edict]: For the next thirty days no one should pray to any god or human except to you, O king. Anyone who doesn’t obey will be thrown into the lions’ den. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Now, O king, ·make the law [enforce the edict] and sign ·your name to it [the document] so that it cannot be changed, because then it will be a law of the Medes and Persians and cannot be canceled.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"So King Darius signed the ·law [document and edict]."},{"num":10,"verse":"Even though Daniel knew that the ·new law [document] had been ·written [signed], he went to pray in an upstairs room in his house, which had windows that opened toward Jerusalem. Three times each day Daniel would kneel down to pray and ·thank [praise] God, just as he always had done [1 Kin. 8:35–36; Ps. 55:17]."},{"num":11,"verse":"Then those men ·went as a group [conspired] and found Daniel praying and ·asking God for help [seeking mercy from God]. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So they ·went to [approached] the king and talked to him about the ·law he had made [edict]. They said, “Didn’t you sign a ·law [edict] that says no one may pray to any god or human except you, O king? Doesn’t it say that anyone who disobeys during the next thirty days will be thrown into the lions’ den?”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Then they said to the king, “Daniel, one of the ·captives [exiles] from Judah, ·is not paying attention to [disregards] you, O king, or to the ·law [edict] you signed. Daniel still prays three times every day.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"The king ·became very upset [was displeased] when he heard ·this [the word]. He ·wanted [set his mind] to ·save [rescue] Daniel, and he worked hard until sunset trying to think of a way to ·save [rescue] him."},{"num":15,"verse":"Then those men ·went as a group to [or conspired against] the king. They said, “·Remember [Know], O king, the law of the Medes and Persians says that no ·law [edict] or command given by the king can be changed.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"So King Darius gave the order, and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May the God you ·serve [fear; Prov. 1:7] all the time ·save [rescue] you!” "},{"num":17,"verse":"A stone was brought and placed over the ·opening [mouth] of the lions’ den. Then the king used his signet ring and the rings of his ·royal [noble; important] officers to put special seals on the rock [rings with personal identification symbols that could be pressed into soft clay]. This ensured that ·no one would move the rock and bring Daniel out [nothing would be changed with Daniel]. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Then King Darius went back to his palace. He ·did not eat [fasted] that night, ·he did not have any entertainment [nothing was; referring to food and/or women] brought to him, and he could not sleep."},{"num":19,"verse":"The next morning King Darius got up at dawn and ·hurried [or in agitation went] to the lions’ den. "},{"num":20,"verse":"As he came near the den, he was worried. He called out to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God! Has your God that you always ·worship [fear; serve; Prov. 1:7] been able to ·save [rescue] you from the lions?”"},{"num":21,"verse":"Daniel answered, “O king, live forever!

So they lifted him out and did not find any injury on him, because Daniel had trusted in his God."},{"num":24,"verse":"Then the king commanded that the men who had ·accused [conspired against; eaten pieces of] Daniel be brought to the lions’ den. They, their wives, and their children were thrown into the den. The lions ·grabbed [overpowered] them before they ·hit [reached] the floor of the den and ·crushed their bones [or tore their bodies into pieces; Prov. 28:10]."},{"num":25,"verse":"Then King Darius wrote a letter to all people and all nations, ·to those who spoke every language [and tongues] in the world:"},{"num":28,"verse":"So Daniel was ·successful [prosperous] during the time Darius was king ·and [or even] when Cyrus the Persian was king [may be two different names for the same king]."}]
