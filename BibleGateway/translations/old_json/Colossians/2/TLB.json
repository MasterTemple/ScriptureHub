[{"num":2,"verse":"I wish you could know how much I have struggled in prayer for you and for the church at Laodicea, and for my many other friends who have never known me personally. "},{"num":2,"verse":"This is what I have asked of God for you: that you will be encouraged and knit together by strong ties of love, and that you will have the rich experience of knowing Christ with real certainty and clear understanding. For God’s secret plan, now at last made known, is Christ himself. "},{"num":3,"verse":"In him lie hidden all the mighty, untapped treasures of wisdom and knowledge."},{"num":4,"verse":"I am saying this because I am afraid that someone may fool you with smooth talk. "},{"num":5,"verse":"For though I am far away from you my heart is with you, happy because you are getting along so well, happy because of your strong faith in Christ. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And now just as you trusted Christ to save you, trust him, too, for each day’s problems; live in vital union with him. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Let your roots grow down into him and draw up nourishment from him. See that you go on growing in the Lord, and become strong and vigorous in the truth you were taught. Let your lives overflow with joy and thanksgiving for all he has done."},{"num":8,"verse":"Don’t let others spoil your faith and joy with their philosophies, their wrong and shallow answers built on men’s thoughts and ideas, instead of on what Christ has said. "},{"num":9,"verse":"For in Christ there is all of God in a human body; "},{"num":10,"verse":"so you have everything when you have Christ, and you are filled with God through your union with Christ. He is the highest Ruler, with authority over every other power."},{"num":11,"verse":"When you came to Christ, he set you free from your evil desires, not by a bodily operation of circumcision but by a spiritual operation, the baptism of your souls. "},{"num":12,"verse":"For in baptism you see how your old, evil nature died with him and was buried with him; and then you came up out of death with him into a new life because you trusted the Word of the mighty God who raised Christ from the dead."},{"num":13,"verse":"You were dead in sins, and your sinful desires were not yet cut away. Then he gave you a share in the very life of Christ, for he forgave all your sins, "},{"num":14,"verse":"and blotted out the charges proved against you, the list of his commandments which you had not obeyed. He took this list of sins and destroyed it by nailing it to Christ’s cross. "},{"num":15,"verse":"In this way God took away Satan’s power to accuse you of sin, and God openly displayed to the whole world Christ’s triumph at the cross where your sins were all taken away."},{"num":16,"verse":"So don’t let anyone criticize you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating Jewish holidays and feasts or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths. "},{"num":17,"verse":"For these were only temporary rules that ended when Christ came. They were only shadows of the real thing—of Christ himself. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Don’t let anyone declare you lost when you refuse to worship angels, as they say you must. They have seen a vision, they say, and know you should. These proud men (though they claim to be so humble) have a very clever imagination.
