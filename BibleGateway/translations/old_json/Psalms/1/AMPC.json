[{"header":"Psalm 1[a]"},{"num":1,"verse":"Blessed (happy, fortunate, prosperous, and enviable) is the man who walks and lives not in the counsel of the ungodly [following their advice, their plans and purposes], nor stands [submissive and inactive] in the path where sinners walk, nor sits down [to relax and rest] where the scornful [and the mockers] gather."},{"num":2,"verse":"But his delight and desire are in the law of the Lord, and on His law (the precepts, the instructions, the teachings of God) he habitually meditates (ponders and studies) by day and by night."},{"num":3,"verse":"And he shall be like a tree firmly planted [and tended] by the streams of water, ready to bring forth its fruit in its season; its leaf also shall not fade or wither; and everything he does shall prosper [and come to maturity]."},{"num":4,"verse":"Not so the wicked [those disobedient and living without God are not so]. But they are like the chaff [worthless, dead, without substance] which the wind drives away."},{"num":5,"verse":"Therefore the wicked [those disobedient and living without God] shall not stand [justified] in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous [those who are upright and in right standing with God]."},{"num":6,"verse":"For the Lord knows and is fully acquainted with the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly [those living outside Godâ€™s will] shall perish (end in ruin and come to nought)."}]
