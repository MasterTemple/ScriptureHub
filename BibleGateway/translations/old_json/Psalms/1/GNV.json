[{"num":1,"verse":"Whether it was Esdras, or any other that gathered the Psalms into a book, it seemeth he did set this Psalm first in manner of a preface, to exhort all godly men to study and meditate the heavenly wisdom.  For the effect hereof is,  1 That they be blessed which give themselves wholly all their life to the holy Scriptures; 4 and that the wicked contemners of God, though they seem for a while happy, yet at length shall come to miserable destruction."},{"num":1,"verse":"Blessed is the man that doth not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful."},{"num":2,"verse":"But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night."},{"num":3,"verse":"For he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters, that will bring forth her fruits in due season: whose leaf shall not fade: so whatsoever he shall do, shall prosper."},{"num":4,"verse":"The wicked are not so, but as the chaff, which the wind driveth away."},{"num":5,"verse":"Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous."},{"num":6,"verse":"For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish."}]
