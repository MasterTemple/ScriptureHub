[{"num":1,"verse":"Blessed is the ish that walketh not in the Etzah (counsel, scheme) of the Resha’im, nor standeth in the Derech Chatta’im, nor sitteth in the Moshav (seat) of the Leitzim (scornful, ones mocking and reviling)."},{"num":2,"verse":"But his delight is in the Torat Hashem; and in His torah doth he meditate yomam v’lailah."},{"num":3,"verse":"And he shall be like an etz planted by the streams of mayim, that bringeth forth its p’ri in its season; the leaf thereof also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."},{"num":4,"verse":"The Resha’im are not so, but are like the chaff which the ruach driveth away."},{"num":5,"verse":"Therefore the Resha’im shall not stand in the Mishpat, nor Chatta’im (sinners) in the Adat Tzaddikim."},{"num":6,"verse":"For Hashem knoweth the Derech Tzaddikim, but the Derech Resha’im shall perish. T.N. The next Psalm says that the whole world, all the earth, is, or will be, the possession of Moshiach, and that Hashem assures Moshiach of this; therefore, the Great Commission (Mt 28:19-20) was given to preach Moshiach to the ends of the earth that the whole world may hear."}]
