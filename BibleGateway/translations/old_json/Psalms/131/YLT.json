[{"num":131,"verse":"A Song of the Ascents, by David. Jehovah, my heart hath not been haughty, Nor have mine eyes been high, Nor have I walked in great things, And in things too wonderful for me."},{"num":2,"verse":"Have I not compared, and kept silent my soul, As a weaned one by its mother? As a weaned one by me [is] my soul."},{"num":3,"verse":"Israel doth wait on Jehovah, From henceforth, and unto the age!"}]
