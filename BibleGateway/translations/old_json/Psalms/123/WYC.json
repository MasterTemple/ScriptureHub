(I raise up my eyes to thee; who livest in heaven.)"},{"num":2,"verse":"Lo! as the eyes of servants be in the hands of their lords. As the eyes of the handmaid be in the hands of her lady; so our eyes be to our Lord God, till he have mercy on us. (Lo! like the eyes of the servant look to the hand of his lord; and like the eyes of the servantess look to the hand of her lady; so let our eyes look to the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.)"},{"num":3,"verse":"Lord, have thou mercy on us, have thou mercy on us; for we be much filled with despising (for we be greatly despised)."},{"num":4,"verse":"For our soul is much filled; we be shame to them that be abundant with riches, and despising to proud men. (For our soul is filled full, with the scorn of those who have abundant riches; and with disdain from the proud.)"}]
