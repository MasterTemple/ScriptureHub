[{"num":78,"verse":"O my people, listen to my teaching. Open your ears to what I am saying. "},{"num":2,"verse":"For I will show you lessons from our history, stories handed down to us from former generations. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I will reveal these truths to you so that you can describe these glorious deeds of Jehovah to your children and tell them about the mighty miracles he did. "},{"num":5,"verse":"For he gave his laws to Israel and commanded our fathers to teach them to their children, "},{"num":6,"verse":"so that they in turn could teach their children too. Thus his laws pass down from generation to generation. "},{"num":7,"verse":"In this way each generation has been able to obey his laws and to set its hope anew on God and not forget his glorious miracles. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Thus they did not need to be as their fathers were—stubborn, rebellious, unfaithful, refusing to give their hearts to God."},{"num":9,"verse":"The people of Ephraim, though fully armed, turned their backs and fled when the day of battle came "},{"num":10,"verse":"because they didn’t obey his laws. They refused to follow his ways. "},{"num":11,"verse":"And they forgot about the wonderful miracles God had done for them and for their fathers in Egypt. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For he divided the sea before them and led them through! The water stood banked up along both sides of them! "},{"num":14,"verse":"In the daytime he led them by a cloud, and at night by a pillar of fire. "},{"num":15,"verse":"He split open the rocks in the wilderness to give them plenty of water, as though gushing from a spring. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Streams poured from the rock, flowing like a river!"},{"num":17,"verse":"Yet they kept on with their rebellion, sinning against the God who is above all gods. "},{"num":18,"verse":"They murmured and complained, demanding other food than God was giving them. "},{"num":19,"verse":"They even spoke against God himself. “Why can’t he give us decent food as well as water?” they grumbled. "},{"num":21,"verse":"Jehovah heard them and was angry; the fire of his wrath burned against Israel "},{"num":22,"verse":"because they didn’t believe in God or trust in him to care for them, "},{"num":23,"verse":"even though he commanded the skies to open—he opened the windows of heaven—"},{"num":24,"verse":"and rained down manna for their food. He gave them bread from heaven! "},{"num":25,"verse":"They ate angels’ food! He gave them all they could hold."},{"num":26,"verse":"And he led forth the east wind and guided the south wind by his mighty power. "},{"num":27,"verse":"He rained down birds as thick as dust, clouds of them like sands along the shore! "},{"num":28,"verse":"He caused the birds to fall to the ground among the tents. "},{"num":29,"verse":"The people ate their fill. He gave them what they asked for. "},{"num":30,"verse":"But they had hardly finished eating, and the meat was yet in their mouths, "},{"num":31,"verse":"when the anger of the Lord rose against them and killed the finest of Israel’s young men. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Yet even so the people kept on sinning and refused to believe in miracles. "},{"num":33,"verse":"So he cut their lives short and gave them years of terror and disaster."},{"num":34,"verse":"Then at last, when he had ruined them, they walked awhile behind him; how earnestly they turned around and followed him! "},{"num":35,"verse":"Then they remembered that God was their Rock—that their Savior was the God above all gods. "},{"num":36,"verse":"But it was only with their words that they followed him, not with their hearts; "},{"num":37,"verse":"their hearts were far away. They did not keep their promises. "},{"num":38,"verse":"Yet he was merciful and forgave their sins and didn’t destroy them all. Many and many a time he held back his anger. "},{"num":39,"verse":"For he remembered that they were merely mortal men, gone in a moment like a breath of wind."},{"num":40,"verse":"Oh, how often they rebelled against him in those desert years and grieved his heart. "},{"num":41,"verse":"Again and again they turned away and tempted God to kill them, and limited the Holy One of Israel from giving them his blessings. "},{"num":42,"verse":"They forgot his power and love and how he had rescued them from their enemies; "},{"num":43,"verse":"they forgot the plagues he sent upon the Egyptians in Tanis—"},{"num":44,"verse":"how he turned their rivers into blood so that no one could drink, "},{"num":45,"verse":"how he sent vast swarms of flies to fill the land, and how the frogs had covered all of Egypt!"},{"num":46,"verse":"He gave their crops to caterpillars. Their harvest was consumed by locusts. "},{"num":47,"verse":"He destroyed their grapevines and their sycamores with hail. "},{"num":48,"verse":"Their cattle died in the fields, mortally wounded by huge hailstones from heaven. Their sheep were killed by lightning. "},{"num":49,"verse":"He loosed on them the fierceness of his anger, sending sorrow and trouble. He dispatched against them a band of destroying angels. "},{"num":50,"verse":"He gave free course to his anger and did not spare the Egyptians’ lives, but handed them over to plagues and sickness. "},{"num":51,"verse":"Then he killed the eldest son in each Egyptian family—he who was the beginning of its strength and joy."},{"num":52,"verse":"But he led forth his own people like a flock, guiding them safely through the wilderness. "},{"num":53,"verse":"He kept them safe, so they were not afraid. But the sea closed in upon their enemies and overwhelmed them. "},{"num":54,"verse":"He brought them to the border of his land of blessing, to this land of hills he made for them. "},{"num":55,"verse":"He drove out the nations occupying the land and gave each tribe of Israel its apportioned place as its home."},{"num":56,"verse":"Yet though he did all this for them, they still rebelled against the God above all gods and refused to follow his commands. "},{"num":57,"verse":"They turned back from entering the Promised Land and disobeyed as their fathers had. Like a crooked arrow, they missed the target of God’s will. "},{"num":58,"verse":"They made him angry by erecting idols and altars to other gods."},{"num":59,"verse":"When God saw their deeds, his wrath was strong and he despised his people. "},{"num":60,"verse":"Then he abandoned his Tabernacle at Shiloh, where he had lived among mankind, "},{"num":61,"verse":"and allowed his Ark to be captured; he surrendered his glory into enemy hands. "},{"num":62,"verse":"He caused his people to be butchered because his anger was intense. "},{"num":63,"verse":"Their young men were killed by fire, and their girls died before they were old enough to sing their wedding songs. "},{"num":64,"verse":"The priests were slaughtered, and their widows died before they could even begin their lament. "},{"num":65,"verse":"Then the Lord rose up as though awakening from sleep, and like a mighty man aroused by wine, "},{"num":66,"verse":"he routed his enemies; he drove them back and sent them to eternal shame. "},{"num":67,"verse":"But he rejected Joseph’s family, the tribe of Ephraim, "},{"num":68,"verse":"and chose the tribe of Judah—and Mount Zion, which he loved. "},{"num":69,"verse":"There he built his towering temple, solid and enduring as the heavens and the earth. "},{"num":70,"verse":"He chose his servant David, taking him from feeding sheep "},{"num":71,"verse":"and from following the ewes with lambs; God presented David to his people as their shepherd, and he cared for them with a true heart and skillful hands."}]
