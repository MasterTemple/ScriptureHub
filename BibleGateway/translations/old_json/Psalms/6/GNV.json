[{"num":6,"verse":"When David by his sins had provoked God’s wrath, and now felt not only his hand against him, but also conceived the horrors of death everlasting, he desireth forgiveness. 6 Bewailing that if God took him away in his indignation, he should lack occasion to praise him as he was wont to do while he was among men. 9 Then suddenly feeling God’s mercy, he sharply rebuketh his enemies which rejoiced in his affliction."},{"num":1,"verse":"O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy wrath."},{"num":2,"verse":"Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord heal me, for my bones are vexed."},{"num":3,"verse":"My soul is also sore troubled: but Lord, how long wilt thou delay?"},{"num":4,"verse":"Return, O Lord: deliver my soul: save me for thy mercy’s sake."},{"num":5,"verse":"For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall praise thee?"},{"num":6,"verse":"I fainted in my mourning: I cause my bed every night to swim, and water my couch with my tears."},{"num":7,"verse":"Mine eye is dimmed for despite, and sunk in because of all mine enemies."},{"num":8,"verse":"Away from me all ye workers of iniquity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping."},{"num":9,"verse":"The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer."},{"num":10,"verse":"All mine enemies shall be confounded and sore vexed: they shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly."}]
