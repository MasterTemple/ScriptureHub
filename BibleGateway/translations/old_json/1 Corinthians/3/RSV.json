"},{"num":2,"verse":"I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not ready for it; and even yet you are not ready, "},{"num":3,"verse":"for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving like ordinary men? "},{"num":4,"verse":"For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apol′los,” are you not merely men?"},{"num":5,"verse":"What then is Apol′los? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I planted, Apol′los watered, but God gave the growth.
