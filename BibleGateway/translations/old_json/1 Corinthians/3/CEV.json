You are like babies as far as your faith in Christ is concerned. "},{"num":2,"verse":"So I had to treat you like babies and feed you milk. You could not take solid food, and you still cannot, "},{"num":3,"verse":"because you are not yet spiritual. You are jealous and argue with each other. This proves that you are not spiritual and that you are acting like the people of this world."},{"num":4,"verse":"Some of you say that you follow me, and others claim to follow Apollos. Isn’t that how ordinary people behave? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Apollos and I are merely servants who helped you to have faith. It was the Lord who made it all happen. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I planted the seeds, Apollos watered them, but God made them sprout and grow. "},{"num":7,"verse":"What matters isn’t those who planted or watered, but God who made the plants grow. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The one who plants is just as important as the one who waters. And each one will be paid for what they do.

I laid a foundation on which others have built. But we must each be careful how we build, "},{"num":11,"verse":"because Christ is the only foundation.

Then everyone will find out if we have used gold, silver, and precious stones, or wood, hay, and straw. "},{"num":14,"verse":"We will be rewarded if our building is left standing. "},{"num":15,"verse":"But if it is destroyed by the fire, we will lose everything.

If any of you think you are wise in the things of this world, you will have to become foolish before you can be truly wise.
