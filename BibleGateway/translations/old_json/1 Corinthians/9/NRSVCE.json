[{"header":"The Rights of an Apostle"},{"num":9,"verse":"Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? "},{"num":2,"verse":"If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."},{"num":3,"verse":"This is my defense to those who would examine me. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Do we not have the right to our food and drink? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? "},{"num":6,"verse":"Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living? "},{"num":7,"verse":"Who at any time pays the expenses for doing military service? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk?"},{"num":8,"verse":"Do I say this on human authority? Does not the law also say the same? "},{"num":9,"verse":"For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned? "},{"num":10,"verse":"Or does he not speak entirely for our sake?

Indeed, I would rather die than that—no one will deprive me of my ground for boasting! "},{"num":16,"verse":"If I proclaim the gospel, this gives me no ground for boasting, for an obligation is laid on me, and woe to me if I do not proclaim the gospel! "},{"num":17,"verse":"For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission. "},{"num":18,"verse":"What then is my reward? Just this: that in my proclamation I may make the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel."},{"num":19,"verse":"For though I am free with respect to all, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I might win more of them.
