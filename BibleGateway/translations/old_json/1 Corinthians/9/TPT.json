[{"header":"Paul’s Apostolic Freedom"},{"num":9,"verse":"Am I not completely free and unrestrained? Absolutely! Am I not an apostle? Of course! Haven’t I had a personal encounter with our Jesus face-to-face—and continue to see him? Emphatically yes! Aren’t you all the proof of my ministry in the Lord? Certainly! "},{"num":2,"verse":"If others do not recognize me as their apostle, at least you are bound to do so, for now your lives are joined to the Lord. You are the living proof, the certificate of my apostleship."},{"num":3,"verse":"So to those who want to continually criticize my apostolic ministry, here’s my statement of defense. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Don’t we apostles have the right to be supported financially? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Don’t we have the right to travel accompanied by our believing wives and be supported as a couple, as do the other apostles, such as Peter the Rock and the Lord’s brothers? "},{"num":6,"verse":"Of course we do! Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to stop working for a living?"},{"header":"Responsibility to Financially Support God’s Servants"},{"num":7,"verse":"Who serves in the military at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not enjoy the grapes for himself? Who would nurture and shepherd a flock and never get to drink its fresh milk? "},{"num":8,"verse":"Am I merely giving you my own opinions, or does the Torah teach the same things? "},{"num":9,"verse":"For it is written in the law of Moses:"},{"num":10,"verse":"Doesn’t he also give us this principle so that we won’t withhold support from his workers? It was written so that we would understand that the one spiritually “plowing” and spiritually “treading out the grain” also labors with the expectation of enjoying the harvest. "},{"num":11,"verse":"So, if we’ve sowed many spiritual gifts among you, is it too much to expect to reap material gifts from you? "},{"num":12,"verse":"And if you have supported others, don’t we rightfully deserve this privilege even more?"},{"num":13,"verse":"Don’t you know that the priests employed in sacred duty in the temple are provided for by temple resources? And the priests who serve at the altar receive a portion of the offerings? "},{"num":14,"verse":"In the same way, the Lord has directed those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel. As for me, I’ve preferred to never use any of these rights for myself. "},{"num":15,"verse":"And keep in mind that I’m not writing all this because I’m hinting that you should support me."},{"header":"Paul Renounces His Rights for the Sake of the Gospel"},{"num":16,"verse":"For you see, even though I proclaim the good news, I can’t take the credit for my labors, for I am compelled to fulfill my duty by completing this work. It would be agony to me if I did not constantly preach the gospel! "},{"num":17,"verse":"If it were my own idea to preach as a way to make a living, I would expect to be paid. Since it’s not my idea but God’s, who commissioned me, I am entrusted with the stewardship of the gospel whether or not I’m paid. "},{"num":18,"verse":"So then, where is my reward? It is found in continually depositing the good news into people’s hearts, without obligation, free of charge, and not insisting on my rights to be financially supported."},{"header":"Paul, a Servant to All"},{"num":19,"verse":"Now, even though I am free from obligations to others, I joyfully make myself a servant to all in order to win as many converts as possible.

"},{"num":22,"verse":"I became “weak” to the weak to win the weak. I have adapted to the culture of every place I’ve gone so that I could more easily win people to Christ. "},{"num":23,"verse":"I’ve done all this so that I would become God’s partner for the sake of the gospel."},{"header":"Paul’s Disciplined Lifestyle"},{"num":24,"verse":"Isn’t it obvious that all runners on the racetrack keep on running to win, but only one receives the victor’s prize? Yet each one of you must run the race to be victorious. "},{"num":25,"verse":"A true athlete will be disciplined in every respect, practicing constant self-control in order to win a laurel wreath that quickly withers. But we run our race to win a victor’s crown that will last forever.
