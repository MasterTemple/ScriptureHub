"},{"num":6,"verse":"Or are Barnabas and I the only ones who don’t have the right to be set free from the need to work? "},{"num":7,"verse":"Who serves in the army at their own expense? Who plants a vineyard and doesn’t eat its fruit? Who looks after animals and doesn’t drink the milk?"},{"num":8,"verse":"I’m not just using human illustrations to make the point; the law says the same thing, doesn’t it?

Yes, it does – because it’s written that the one who ploughs should do so in hope of the produce, and the thresher should thresh in hope of a share in the crop.
