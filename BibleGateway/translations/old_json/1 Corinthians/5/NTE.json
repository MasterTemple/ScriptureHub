Well I never – a man taking his father’s wife! "},{"num":2,"verse":"And you’re puffed up! Why aren’t you in mourning? Why aren’t you getting rid of the person who’s done such a thing?"},{"num":3,"verse":"Let me tell you what I’ve already done. I may be away from you physically, but I’m present in the spirit; and I’ve already passed judgment, as though I was there with you, on the person who has behaved in this way.
