[{"header":"Apostles Are Servants of Christ"},{"num":4,"verse":"People should think of us as servants of Christ, ·the ones God has trusted with his [and stewards/household managers of God’s] ·secrets [mysteries]. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Now in this way ·those who are trusted with something valuable [stewards; household managers] must ·show they are worthy of that trust [be found faithful]. "},{"num":3,"verse":"As for myself, ·I do not care [or it is of no consequence; it is a minor thing] if I am judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I know of no wrong I have done, but this does not make me ·right before the Lord [innocent; acquitted; justified]. The Lord is the One who judges me. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So do not judge before the ·right [appointed] time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light things that are now hidden in darkness, and will make known the secret ·purposes [motives] of people’s hearts. Then God will ·praise [give appropriate commendation to] each one of them."},{"num":6,"verse":"Brothers and sisters, I have used Apollos and myself as examples so you could learn through us the meaning of the saying, “·Follow only [Do not go beyond] ·what is written in the Scriptures [or what I have already written to you; what is written].” Then you will not ·be more proud of one person than another [or arrogantly support one person over another]. "},{"num":7,"verse":"[For] Who ·says you are better than others [made you so important; or sees anything different in you]? What do you have that was not given to you?

"},{"num":9,"verse":"But it seems to me that God has put us apostles ·in last place [or on display at the end of the procession], like those sentenced to die [the image is of prisoners of war being led through the city in disgrace, condemned to die in the arena]. We are like a ·show [spectacle; display] for the whole world to see—angels and people. "},{"num":10,"verse":"We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are very wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You receive honor, but we are ·shamed [disgraced; dishonored]. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Even ·to this very hour [or now] we do not have enough to eat or drink or to wear. We are often beaten, and we have no homes in which to live. "},{"num":12,"verse":"We work hard with our own hands [Paul earned his own living so as not to burden the church and to avoid accusations of profiting from the Gospel; 1 Thess. 2:9]. When people ·curse [insult; revile] us, we bless them. When they ·hurt [persecute] us, we ·put up with it [endure; persevere]. "},{"num":13,"verse":"When they ·tell evil lies about [slander] us, we ·speak nice words about them [answer gently; or humbly appeal; entreat]. Even today, we are treated as though we were the garbage of the world—·the filth of the earth [everyone’s scum/filth; or scum/filth in everyone’s eyes]."},{"num":14,"verse":"I am not writing this to make you feel ashamed, but to ·warn [admonish; correct] you as my own ·dear [beloved] children.

He will ·help you remember [remind you about] my way of life in Christ Jesus, just as I teach it in all the churches everywhere."},{"num":18,"verse":"Some of you have become ·proud [arrogant; puffed up], thinking that I will not come to you again. "},{"num":19,"verse":"But I will come to you very soon if the Lord ·wishes [wills; allows]. Then I will ·know [find out; learn] ·what the proud ones do, not what they say [not just the talk/word of these arrogant people, but also their power], "},{"num":20,"verse":"because the kingdom of God ·is present [or consists] not in talk but in power. "},{"num":21,"verse":"Which do you want: that I come to you with ·punishment [a rod] or with love and ·gentleness [or a gentle spirit]?"}]
