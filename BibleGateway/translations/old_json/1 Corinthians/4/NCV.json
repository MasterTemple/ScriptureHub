"},{"num":2,"verse":"Now in this way those who are trusted with something valuable must show they are worthy of that trust. "},{"num":3,"verse":"As for myself, I do not care if I am judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I know of no wrong I have done, but this does not make me right before the Lord. The Lord is the One who judges me. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So do not judge before the right time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light things that are now hidden in darkness, and will make known the secret purposes of people’s hearts. Then God will praise each one of them."},{"num":6,"verse":"Brothers and sisters, I have used Apollos and myself as examples so you could learn through us the meaning of the saying, “Follow only what is written in the Scriptures.” Then you will not be more proud of one person than another.

And if it was given to you, why do you brag as if you did not receive it as a gift?"},{"num":8,"verse":"You think you already have everything you need. You think you are rich. You think you have become kings without us. I wish you really were kings so we could be kings together with you.
