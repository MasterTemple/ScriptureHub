[{"header":"Apostles of Christ"},{"num":4,"verse":"This is what people should think about us: We are servants of Christ. We are the ones God has trusted with his secret truths. "},{"num":2,"verse":"A person who is trusted with something must show that he is worthy of that trust. "},{"num":3,"verse":"I do not care if I am judged by you or if I am judged by any human court. I do not even judge myself. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I know of no wrong that I have done. But this does not make me innocent. The Lord is the One who judges me. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So do not judge before the right time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light things that are now hidden in darkness. He will make known the secret purposes of people’s hearts. Then God will give everyone the praise he should get."},{"num":6,"verse":"Brothers, I have used Apollos and myself as examples. I did this so that you could learn from us the meaning of the words, “Follow only what is written in the Scriptures.” Then you will not be proud of one man and hate another.

And if this is so, why do you brag as if you got these things by your own power?"},{"num":8,"verse":"You think you have everything you need. You think you are rich. You think you have become kings without us. I wish you really were kings! Then we could be kings together with you.

"},{"num":19,"verse":"But I will come very soon if the Lord wants me to. Then I will see what those who are proud can do, not what they say.
