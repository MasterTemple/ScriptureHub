I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God."},{"num":10,"verse":"However, by the grace of God I am what I am, and the grace he has bestowed upon me has not proved to be fruitless. Indeed, I have worked harder than any of them—although that should not be credited to me but to the grace of God within me."},{"num":11,"verse":"But whether it was I or they, this is what we preach and what you have come to believe."},{"header":"The Resurrection of the Dead"},{"num":12,"verse":"The Resurrection and Faith. Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"},{"num":13,"verse":"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised."},{"num":14,"verse":"And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is useless, and so is your faith."},{"num":15,"verse":"We are even false witnesses to God, for we testified that he raised Christ when he did not raise him up, assuming it is true that the dead are not raised."},{"num":16,"verse":"For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised."},{"num":17,"verse":"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is without any foundation, and you are still in your sins."},{"num":18,"verse":"Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ are utterly lost."},{"num":19,"verse":"If it is for just this life that we have hoped in Christ, we are the most pitiable of all men."},{"num":20,"verse":"Christ, the Firstfruits. But Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep."},{"num":21,"verse":"For since death came into the world through a man, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a man."},{"num":22,"verse":"Just as in Adam all die, so all will be brought to life in Christ,"},{"num":23,"verse":"but each one in proper order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward, at his coming, those who belong to Christ."},{"num":24,"verse":"Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after he has destroyed every sovereignty and authority and power."},{"num":25,"verse":"For he is destined to reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet."},{"num":26,"verse":"The last enemy to be destroyed is death."},{"num":27,"verse":"For he has put all things under his feet. But when it says “all things are put under,” it is obvious that this excludes the one who subjected everything to him."},{"num":28,"verse":"When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who made all things subject to him, so that God may be all in all."},{"num":29,"verse":"Practical Faith.

What sort of body will they have when they come back?”"},{"num":36,"verse":"This is foolish.

There is one kind for human beings, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish."},{"num":40,"verse":"There are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. The splendor of heavenly bodies is of one kind, and that of earthly bodies is another."},{"num":41,"verse":"The sun has a splendor of its own, the moon another splendor, and the stars still another. Indeed, the stars differ among themselves in splendor."},{"num":42,"verse":"So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable."},{"num":43,"verse":"What is sown in dishonor is raised as glorious. What is sown in weakness is raised in power."},{"num":44,"verse":"What is sown is a physical body; what is raised is a spiritual body."},{"num":47,"verse":"The first man was formed from the dust of the earth; the second man is from heaven."},{"num":48,"verse":"The man formed from dust is the pattern for earthly people; the heavenly man is the pattern for those who are of heaven."},{"num":49,"verse":"Just as we have borne the image of the man formed from dust, so shall we also bear the likeness of the heavenly one."},{"num":50,"verse":"Where, O Death, Is Your Victory? What I am asserting, brethren, is that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable inherit what is imperishable."},{"num":51,"verse":"Listen while I tell you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed"},{"num":52,"verse":"in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound of the last trumpet.
