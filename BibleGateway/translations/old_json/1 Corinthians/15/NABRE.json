[{"header":"A. The Resurrection of Christ"},{"header":"Chapter 15[a]"},{"num":1,"verse":"The Gospel Teaching. Now I am reminding you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you indeed received and in which you also stand. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Through it you are also being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For I handed on to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures; "},{"num":4,"verse":"that he was buried; that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures; "},{"num":5,"verse":"that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. "},{"num":6,"verse":"After that, he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. "},{"num":7,"verse":"After that he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Last of all, as to one born abnormally, he appeared to me. "},{"num":9,"verse":"For I am the least of the apostles, not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been ineffective. Indeed, I have toiled harder than all of them; not I, however, but the grace of God [that is] with me. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Therefore, whether it be I or they, so we preach and so you believed."},{"header":"B. The Resurrection of the Dead"},{"num":12,"verse":"But if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead? "},{"num":13,"verse":"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then neither has Christ been raised. "},{"num":14,"verse":"And if Christ has not been raised, then empty [too] is our preaching; empty, too, your faith. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Then we are also false witnesses to God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if in fact the dead are not raised. "},{"num":16,"verse":"For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised, "},{"num":17,"verse":"and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. "},{"num":19,"verse":"If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are the most pitiable people of all."},{"num":20,"verse":"But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. "},{"num":21,"verse":"For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead came also through a human being. "},{"num":22,"verse":"For just as in Adam all die, so too in Christ shall all be brought to life, "},{"num":23,"verse":"but each one in proper order: Christ the firstfruits; then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ; "},{"num":24,"verse":"then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has destroyed every sovereignty and every authority and power. "},{"num":25,"verse":"For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. "},{"num":26,"verse":"The last enemy to be destroyed is death, "},{"num":27,"verse":"for “he subjected everything under his feet.” But when it says that everything has been subjected, it is clear that it excludes the one who subjected everything to him. "},{"num":28,"verse":"When everything is subjected to him, then the Son himself will [also] be subjected to the one who subjected everything to him, so that God may be all in all."},{"num":29,"verse":"Otherwise, what will people accomplish by having themselves baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, then why are they having themselves baptized for them?"},{"num":30,"verse":"Moreover, why are we endangering ourselves all the time? "},{"num":31,"verse":"Every day I face death; I swear it by the pride in you [brothers] that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. "},{"num":32,"verse":"If at Ephesus I fought with beasts, so to speak, what benefit was it to me? If the dead are not raised:"},{"num":33,"verse":"Do not be led astray:"},{"num":34,"verse":"Become sober as you ought and stop sinning. For some have no knowledge of God; I say this to your shame."},{"header":"C. The Manner of the Resurrection[p]"},{"num":35,"verse":"But someone may say, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come back?”"},{"num":36,"verse":"The Resurrection Body. You fool! What you sow is not brought to life unless it dies. "},{"num":37,"verse":"And what you sow is not the body that is to be but a bare kernel of wheat, perhaps, or of some other kind; "},{"num":38,"verse":"but God gives it a body as he chooses, and to each of the seeds its own body. "},{"num":39,"verse":"Not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for human beings, another kind of flesh for animals, another kind of flesh for birds, and another for fish. "},{"num":40,"verse":"There are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the brightness of the heavenly is one kind and that of the earthly another. "},{"num":41,"verse":"The brightness of the sun is one kind, the brightness of the moon another, and the brightness of the stars another. For star differs from star in brightness."},{"num":42,"verse":"So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown corruptible; it is raised incorruptible. "},{"num":43,"verse":"It is sown dishonorable; it is raised glorious. It is sown weak; it is raised powerful. "},{"num":44,"verse":"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual one."},{"num":45,"verse":"So, too, it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living being,” the last Adam a life-giving spirit. "},{"num":46,"verse":"But the spiritual was not first; rather the natural and then the spiritual. "},{"num":47,"verse":"The first man was from the earth, earthly; the second man, from heaven. "},{"num":48,"verse":"As was the earthly one, so also are the earthly, and as is the heavenly one, so also are the heavenly. "},{"num":49,"verse":"Just as we have borne the image of the earthly one, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly one."},{"num":50,"verse":"The Resurrection Event. This I declare, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption. "},{"num":51,"verse":"Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed, "},{"num":52,"verse":"in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. "},{"num":53,"verse":"For that which is corruptible must clothe itself with incorruptibility, and that which is mortal must clothe itself with immortality. "},{"num":54,"verse":"And when this which is corruptible clothes itself with incorruptibility and this which is mortal clothes itself with immortality, then the word that is written shall come about:"},{"num":56,"verse":"The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. "},{"num":57,"verse":"But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"num":58,"verse":"Therefore, my beloved brothers, be firm, steadfast, always fully devoted to the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain."}]
