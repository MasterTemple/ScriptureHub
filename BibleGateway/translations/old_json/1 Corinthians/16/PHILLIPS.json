[{"header":"The matter of the fund: my own immediate plans"},{"num":16,"verse":"Now as far as the fund for Christians in need is concerned, I should like you to follow the same rule that I gave to the Galatian church."},{"num":2,"verse":"On the first day of the week let everyone put so much by him, according to his financial ability, so that there will be no need for collections when I come. Then, on my arrival, I will send whomever you approve to take your gift, with my recommendation, to Jerusalem. If it seems right for me to go as well, we will make up a party together ."},{"num":5,"verse":"I shall come to you after my intended journey through Macedonia and I may stay with you awhile or even spend the winter with you. Then you can see me on my way—wherever it is that I go next. I don’t wish to see you now, for it would merely be in passing, and I hope to spend some time with you, if it is God’s will. I shall stay here in Ephesus until the feast of Pentecost, for there is a great opportunity of doing useful work, and there are many people against me."},{"header":"News of Timothy and Apollos"},{"num":10,"verse":"If Timothy comes to you, put him at his ease. He is as genuine a worker for the Lord as I am, and there is therefore no reason to look down on him. Send him on his way in peace, for I am expecting him to come to me here with the other Christian brothers. As for our brother Apollos I pressed him strongly to go to you with the rest, but it was definitely not God’s will for him to do so then. However, he will come to you as soon as an opportunity occurs."},{"header":"A little sermon in a nutshell!"},{"num":13,"verse":"Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, live like men, be strong!
