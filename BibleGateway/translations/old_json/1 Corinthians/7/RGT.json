Not to tangle you in a snare, but that you may be respectable and serve the Lord without distraction."},{"num":36,"verse":"But if any man thinks he is behaving less than optimally toward his virgin, if she has passed the flower of her age, and so requires, let him do what he will. He does not sin. Let her be married."},{"num":37,"verse":"Nevertheless, he who stands firm in his heart, that he has no need, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart, that he will watch over his virgin, he does well."},{"num":38,"verse":"So then, he who gives her to marriage, does well.
