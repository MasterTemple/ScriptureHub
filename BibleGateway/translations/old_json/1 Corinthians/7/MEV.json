[{"header":"Questions About Marriage"},{"num":7,"verse":"Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.” "},{"num":2,"verse":"Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Let the husband render to the wife due affection, and likewise the wife to the husband. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. Then come together again, so that Satan does not tempt you for lack of self-control. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I speak this as a concession and not as a command. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For I would that all men were even as I myself.

"},{"num":9,"verse":"But if they cannot restrain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion."},{"num":10,"verse":"Now to the married I command, not I, but the Lord, do not let the wife depart from her husband. "},{"num":11,"verse":"But if she departs, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"And if the woman has an unbelieving husband who consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean.

It remains that those who have wives should be as though they had none; "},{"num":30,"verse":"those who weep, as though they did not weep; those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; those who buy, as though they possessed nothing; "},{"num":31,"verse":"and those who use this world, as though they did not make full use of it.
