Likewise, the husband doesn’t have authority over his own body, but the wife does."},{"num":5,"verse":"Don’t refuse to meet each other’s needs unless you both agree for a short period of time to devote yourselves to prayer. Then come back together again so that Satan might not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."},{"num":6,"verse":"I’m saying this to give you permission; it’s not a command."},{"num":7,"verse":"I wish all people were like me, but each has a particular gift from God: one has this gift, and another has that one."},{"num":8,"verse":"I’m telling those who are single and widows that it’s good for them to stay single like me."},{"num":9,"verse":"But if they can’t control themselves, they should get married, because it’s better to marry than to burn with passion."},{"num":10,"verse":"I’m passing on the Lord’s command to those who are married: A wife shouldn’t leave her husband,"},{"num":11,"verse":"but if she does leave him, then she should stay single or be reconciled to her husband.

Otherwise, your children would be contaminated by the world, but now they are spiritually set apart."},{"num":15,"verse":"But if a spouse who doesn’t believe chooses to leave, then let them leave. The brother or sister isn’t tied down in these circumstances. God has called you to peace."},{"num":16,"verse":"How do you know as a wife if you will save your husband?

It’s not to restrict you but rather to promote effective and consistent service to the Lord without distraction."},{"num":36,"verse":"If someone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward an unmarried woman whom he knows, and if he has strong feelings and it seems like the right thing to do, he should do what he wants—he’s not sinning—they should get married."},{"num":37,"verse":"But if a man stands firm in his decision, and doesn’t feel the pressure, but has his own will under control, he does right if he decides in his own heart not to marry the woman."},{"num":38,"verse":"Therefore, the one who marries the unmarried woman does right, and the one who doesn’t get married will do even better."},{"num":39,"verse":"A woman is obligated to stay in her marriage as long as her husband is alive.
