[{"header":"Life Within Marriage"},{"num":7,"verse":"Let me now turn to the matters you wrote about. ‘It is good for a man to have no sexual contact with a woman.’ "},{"num":2,"verse":"Well, yes; but the temptation to immorality means that every man should maintain sexual relations with his own wife, and every woman with her own husband. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The man should give his wife her marital rights, and the woman should do the same for her husband. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The woman isn’t in charge of her own body; her husband is. In the same way, the man isn’t in charge of his own body; his wife is. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Don’t deny one another, except perhaps by agreement for a period of time, so that you may have more space for prayer. But then come together again, in case the satan might tempt you because of your weakness of will."},{"num":6,"verse":"I’m not saying this as a command, but as a concession. "},{"num":7,"verse":"I would be happy to see everyone be in the same situation as myself. But each person has his or her own gift from God, one this way, another that way."},{"header":"Marriage and Divorce"},{"num":8,"verse":"To unmarried people, and to widows, I have this to say: it’s perfectly all right for you to remain like me. "},{"num":9,"verse":"But if you don’t have power over your passions, then get married. Much better to marry than to have desire smouldering away inside you!"},{"num":10,"verse":"I have a command, too, for married people – actually, it’s not just from me, it’s from the Lord: that a woman should not separate from her husband. "},{"num":11,"verse":"If she does, she should remain unmarried or return to her husband. So, too, a man should not divorce his wife."},{"num":12,"verse":"To everyone else I have this to say (this is just me, not the Lord). If a Christian has an unbelieving wife, and she is happy to live with him, he shouldn’t divorce her. "},{"num":13,"verse":"If a woman has an unbelieving husband, and he is happy to live with her, she shouldn’t divorce him. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The unbelieving husband, you see, is made holy by his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy by her husband; otherwise your children would be impure, whereas in fact they are holy. "},{"num":15,"verse":"But if the unbelieving partner wants to separate, let them separate; a brother or sister is not bound in a case like that. God has called you in peace. "},{"num":16,"verse":"If you’re a wife, how d’you know whether or not you will save your husband? If you’re a husband, how d’you know whether or not you will save your wife?"},{"header":"Stay the Way You Were Called"},{"num":17,"verse":"This is the overriding rule: everyone should conduct their lives as the Lord appointed, as God has called them. This is what I lay down in all the churches. "},{"num":18,"verse":"If someone was circumcised when he was called, he shouldn’t try to remove the marks. If someone was uncircumcised when he was called, he shouldn’t get circumcised. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Circumcision is nothing; uncircumcision is nothing; what matters is keeping God’s commandments!"},{"num":20,"verse":"Everyone should stay within the calling they had when they were called. "},{"num":21,"verse":"Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t worry about it (but if you get the chance of freedom, seize it!).

"},{"num":27,"verse":"Are you bound to a wife? Don’t try to dissolve the marriage. Have you had your marriage dissolved? Don’t look for another wife. "},{"num":28,"verse":"But if you do marry, you are not sinning, and if an unmarried woman marries, she is not sinning. But people who go that way will have trouble at a human level, and I would prefer to spare you that."},{"num":29,"verse":"This is what I mean, my brothers and sisters. The present situation won’t last long; for the moment, let those who have wives live as though they weren’t married, "},{"num":30,"verse":"those who weep as though they were not weeping, those who celebrate as though they were not celebrating, those who buy as though they had no possessions, "},{"num":31,"verse":"those who use the world as though they were not making use of it. The pattern of this world, you see, is passing away."},{"header":"Divided Loyalties"},{"num":32,"verse":"I want you to be free from worries. The unmarried man worries about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord; "},{"num":33,"verse":"but the married man worries about the things of the world, in other words, how to please his wife – "},{"num":34,"verse":"and he is pulled in both directions. So too the unmarried woman or girl worries about the things of the Lord, how to be holy both in body and spirit; but the married woman worries about the things of the world, in other words, how to please her husband."},{"num":35,"verse":"I’m saying this for your own benefit. I’m not placing restrictions on you; my aim is that nothing will get in the way of your appropriate behaviour and steady devotion to the Lord."},{"num":36,"verse":"If anyone thinks he is behaving improperly towards his fiancée – if he finds the situation overly stressful, and matters reach a point of necessity – then let him do as he wishes, he won’t be sinning: let them marry.

"},{"num":38,"verse":"So the one who marries his fiancée will do well; and the one who holds back from marrying will do better."},{"num":39,"verse":"A woman is bound in marriage as long as her husband lives.
