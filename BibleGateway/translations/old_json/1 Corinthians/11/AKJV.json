[{"num":11,"verse":"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.

"},{"num":18,"verse":"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. "},{"num":19,"verse":"For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. "},{"num":20,"verse":"When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper. "},{"num":21,"verse":"For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
