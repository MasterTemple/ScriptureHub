[{"header":"Concerning Head Coverings in Worship"},{"num":11,"verse":"Become imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ."},{"num":2,"verse":"Now I praise you that you remember me in all things, and just as I handed over to you the traditions, you hold fast to them. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and the head of Christ is God. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Every man who prays or prophesies while having something on his head dishonors his head, "},{"num":5,"verse":"but every woman who prays or prophesies with uncovered head dishonors her head, for she is one and the same with the one whose head is shaved. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For if a woman does not cover herself, let her hair be shorn off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaved, let her cover her head. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For indeed a man ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For man is not from woman, but woman from man. "},{"num":9,"verse":"For indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Because of this, the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, on account of the angels. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Nevertheless, neither is woman anything apart from man, nor is man anything apart from woman in the Lord. "},{"num":12,"verse":"For just as the woman is from the man, thus also the man is through the woman. But all things are from God. "},{"num":13,"verse":"You judge for yourselves: is it fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? "},{"num":14,"verse":"And does not nature itself teach you that a man, if he wears long hair, it is a dishonor to him? "},{"num":15,"verse":"But a woman, if she wears long hair, it is her glory, because her hair is given for a covering. "},{"num":16,"verse":"But if anyone is disposed to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God."},{"header":"Improper Conduct at the Lord’s Supper"},{"num":17,"verse":"But in giving this instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. "},{"num":18,"verse":"For in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. "},{"num":19,"verse":"For indeed it is necessary that there be factions among you, in order that those who are approved may become evident among you. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Therefore, when you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper. "},{"num":21,"verse":"For when you eat it, each one of you goes ahead to take his own supper, and one is hungry and another is drunk. "},{"num":22,"verse":"For do you not have houses for eating and drinking? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who do not have anything? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you!"},{"num":23,"verse":"For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread, "},{"num":24,"verse":"and after he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” "},{"num":25,"verse":"Likewise also the cup, after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” "},{"num":26,"verse":"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. "},{"num":27,"verse":"So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. "},{"num":28,"verse":"But let a person examine himself, and in this way let him eat from the bread and let him drink from the cup. "},{"num":29,"verse":"For the one who eats and drinks, if he does not recognize the body, eats and drinks judgment against himself. "},{"num":30,"verse":"Because of this, many are weak and sick among you, and quite a few have died. "},{"num":31,"verse":"But if we were evaluating ourselves, we would not be judged. "},{"num":32,"verse":"But if we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined, in order that we will not be condemned with the world."},{"num":33,"verse":"So then, my brothers, when you come together in order to eat the Lord’s supper, wait for one another. "},{"num":34,"verse":"If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And I will give directions about the remaining matters whenever I come."}]
