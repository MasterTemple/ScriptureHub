[{"header":"Spiritual Gifts for the Body"},{"num":12,"verse":"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be ignorant. "},{"num":2,"verse":"You know that when you were pagans, you were enticed by idols that cannot speak, and you got led astray."},{"num":3,"verse":" Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Ruach Elohim says, “Yeshua be cursed,” and no one can say, “Yeshua is Lord,” except by the Ruach ha-Kodesh."},{"num":4,"verse":"Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Ruach. "},{"num":5,"verse":"There are various kinds of service, but the same Lord. "},{"num":6,"verse":"There are various kinds of working, but the same God who works all things in all people. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But to each person is given the manifestation of the Ruach for the benefit of all. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For to one is given through the Ruach a word of wisdom, to another a word of knowledge according to the same Ruach, "},{"num":9,"verse":"to another faith by the same Ruach, to another gifts of healings by the one Ruach, "},{"num":10,"verse":"to another workings of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. "},{"num":11,"verse":"But one and the same Ruach activates all these things, distributing to each person individually as He wills."},{"num":12,"verse":"For just as the body is one and has many parts, and all the parts of the body—though many—are one body, so also is Messiah. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For in one Ruach we were all immersed into one body—whether Jewish or Greek, slave or free—and all were made to drink of one Ruach."},{"num":14,"verse":"For the body is not one part, but many. "},{"num":15,"verse":"If the foot says, “Since I’m not a hand, I’m not part of the body,” is it therefore not part of the body? "},{"num":16,"verse":"And if the ear says, “Since I’m not an eye, I’m not part of the body,” is it for this reason any less part of the body? "},{"num":17,"verse":"If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? "},{"num":18,"verse":"But now God has placed the parts—each one of them—in the body just as He desired. "},{"num":19,"verse":"If they were all one part, where would the body be? "},{"num":20,"verse":"But now there are many parts, yet one body."},{"num":21,"verse":"The eye cannot tell the hand, “I don’t need you!” or in turn the head to the feet, “I don’t need you!” "},{"num":22,"verse":"On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be less important are indispensable. "},{"num":23,"verse":"Those parts of the body that we think to be less honorable, we clothe with greater honor; and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty; "},{"num":24,"verse":"but our presentable parts have no such need. Rather God assembled the body, giving more honor to those who are lacking, "},{"num":25,"verse":"so that there may be no division in the body, but so that the parts may have the same care for one another. "},{"num":26,"verse":"If one part suffers, all the parts suffer together. If one part is honored, all the parts rejoice together."},{"num":27,"verse":"Now you are the body of Messiah, and members individually. "},{"num":28,"verse":"God has put into His community first emissaries, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then healings, helps, leadership, various kinds of tongues. "},{"num":29,"verse":"All are not emissaries, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All do not work miracles, do they? "},{"num":30,"verse":"All do not have gifts of healing, do they? All do not speak in tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they? "},{"num":31,"verse":"But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And still I show you a far better way:"}]
