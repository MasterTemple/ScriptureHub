[{"header":"The Use of Spiritual Gifts"},{"num":12,"verse":"Now about the spiritual gifts [the special endowments given by the Holy Spirit], brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. "},{"num":2,"verse":"You know that when you were pagans, you were led off after speechless idols; however you were led off [whether by impulse or habit]. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Therefore I want you to know that no one speaking by the [power and influence of the] Spirit of God can say, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is [my] Lord,” except by [the power and influence of] the Holy Spirit."},{"num":4,"verse":"Now there are [distinctive] varieties of spiritual gifts [special abilities given by the grace and extraordinary power of the Holy Spirit operating in believers], but it is the same Spirit [who grants them and empowers believers]. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And there are [distinctive] varieties of ministries and service, but it is the same Lord [who is served]. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And there are [distinctive] ways of working [to accomplish things], but it is the same God who produces all things in all believers [inspiring, energizing, and empowering them]. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit [the spiritual illumination and the enabling of the Holy Spirit] for the common good. "},{"num":8,"verse":"To one is given through the [Holy] Spirit [the power to speak] the message of wisdom, and to another [the power to express] the word of knowledge and understanding according to the same Spirit; "},{"num":9,"verse":"to another [wonder-working] faith [is given] by the same [Holy] Spirit, and to another the [extraordinary] gifts of healings by the one Spirit; "},{"num":10,"verse":"and to another the working of miracles, and to another prophecy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people], and to another discernment of spirits [the ability to distinguish sound, godly doctrine from the deceptive doctrine of man-made religions and cults], to another various kinds of [unknown] tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues. "},{"num":11,"verse":"All these things [the gifts, the achievements, the abilities, the empowering] are brought about by one and the same [Holy] Spirit, distributing to each one individually just as He chooses."},{"num":12,"verse":"For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts, though many, form [only] one body, so it is with Christ. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For by one [Holy] Spirit we were all baptized into one body, [spiritually transformed—united together] whether Jews or Greeks (Gentiles), slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one [Holy] Spirit [since the same Holy Spirit fills each life]."},{"num":14,"verse":"For the [human] body does not consist of one part, but of many [limbs and organs]. "},{"num":15,"verse":"If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” is it not on the contrary still a part of the body? "},{"num":16,"verse":"If the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,” is it not on the contrary still a part of the body? "},{"num":17,"verse":"If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole [body] were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? "},{"num":18,"verse":"But now [as things really are], God has placed and arranged the parts in the body, each one of them, just as He willed and saw fit [with the best balance of function]. "},{"num":19,"verse":"If they all were a single organ, where would [the rest of] the body be? "},{"num":20,"verse":"But now [as things really are] there are many parts [different limbs and organs], but a single body. "},{"num":21,"verse":"The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” "},{"num":22,"verse":"But quite the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are [absolutely] necessary; "},{"num":23,"verse":"and as for those parts of the body which we consider less honorable, these we treat with greater honor; and our less presentable parts are treated with greater modesty, "},{"num":24,"verse":"while our more presentable parts do not require it. But God has combined the [whole] body, giving greater honor to that part which lacks it, "},{"num":25,"verse":"so that there would be no division or discord in the body [that is, lack of adaptation of the parts to each other], but that the parts may have the same concern for one another. "},{"num":26,"verse":"And if one member suffers, all the parts share the suffering; if one member is honored, all rejoice with it."},{"num":27,"verse":"Now you [collectively] are Christ’s body, and individually [you are] members of it [each with his own special purpose and function]. "},{"num":28,"verse":"So God has appointed and placed in the church [for His own use]: first apostles [chosen by Christ], second prophets [those who foretell the future, those who speak a new message from God to the people], third teachers, then those who work miracles, then those with the gifts of healings, the helpers, the administrators, and speakers in various kinds of [unknown] tongues. "},{"num":29,"verse":"Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? "},{"num":30,"verse":"Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? "},{"num":31,"verse":"But earnestly desire and strive for the greater gifts [if acquiring them is going to be your goal]."}]
