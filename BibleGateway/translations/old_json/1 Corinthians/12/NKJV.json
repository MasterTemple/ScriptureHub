[{"header":"Spiritual Gifts: Unity in Diversity"},{"num":12,"verse":"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant: "},{"num":2,"verse":"You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit."},{"num":4,"verse":"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. "},{"num":5,"verse":"There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: "},{"num":8,"verse":"for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, "},{"num":9,"verse":"to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, "},{"num":10,"verse":"to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.
