"},{"num":2,"verse":"You know that when you were pagans, you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says “Let Jesus be cursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit."},{"num":4,"verse":"Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; "},{"num":5,"verse":"and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; "},{"num":6,"verse":"and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. "},{"num":7,"verse":"To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. "},{"num":8,"verse":"To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, "},{"num":9,"verse":"to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, "},{"num":10,"verse":"to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.
