[{"header":"Spiritual Gifts"},{"num":12,"verse":"With regard to spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. "},{"num":2,"verse":"You know that when you were pagans you were often led astray by speechless idols, however you were led. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit."},{"num":4,"verse":"Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And there are different ministries, but the same Lord. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And there are different results, but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. "},{"num":7,"verse":"To each person the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of all. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For one person is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, and another the message of knowledge according to the same Spirit, "},{"num":9,"verse":"to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, "},{"num":10,"verse":"to another performance of miracles, to another prophecy, and to another discernment of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body. Whether Jews or Greeks or slaves or free, we were all made to drink of the one Spirit. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For in fact the body is not a single member, but many. "},{"num":15,"verse":"If the foot says, “Since I am not a hand, I am not part of the body,” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. "},{"num":16,"verse":"And if the ear says, “Since I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that.

Instead, God has blended together the body, giving greater honor to the lesser member, "},{"num":25,"verse":"so that there may be no division in the body, but the members may have mutual concern for one another. "},{"num":26,"verse":"If one member suffers, everyone suffers with it. If a member is honored, all rejoice with it."},{"num":27,"verse":"Now you are Christ’s body, and each of you is a member of it.
