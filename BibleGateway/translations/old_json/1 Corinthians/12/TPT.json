"},{"num":13,"verse":"For by one Spirit we all were immersed and mingled into one single body. And no matter our status—whether we are Jews or non-Jews, oppressed or free—we are all privileged to drink deeply of the same Holy Spirit."},{"num":14,"verse":"In fact, the human body is not one single part but rather many parts mingled into one. "},{"num":15,"verse":"So if the foot were to say, “Since I’m not a hand, I’m not a part of the body,” it’s forgetting that it is still a vital part of the body.
