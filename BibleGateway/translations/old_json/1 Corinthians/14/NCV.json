No one understands them; they are speaking secret things through the Spirit. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But those who prophesy are speaking to people to give them strength, encouragement, and comfort. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The ones who speak in different languages are helping only themselves, but those who prophesy are helping the whole church. "},{"num":5,"verse":"I wish all of you had the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages, but more, I wish you would prophesy. Those who prophesy are greater than those who can only speak in different languages—unless someone is there who can explain what is said so that the whole church can be helped."},{"num":6,"verse":"Brothers and sisters, will it help you if I come to you speaking in different languages? No! It will help you only if I bring you a new truth or some new knowledge, or prophecy, or teaching.
