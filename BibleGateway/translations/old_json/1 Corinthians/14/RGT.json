But the one who prophesies, edifies the Church."},{"num":5,"verse":"Now, I would prefer that you all spoke in tongues, even more so that you prophesied. For greater is the one who prophesies, than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the Church may receive edification."},{"num":6,"verse":"And now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I benefit you, unless I speak to you by either revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"},{"num":7,"verse":"Just as things without life give a sound, whether a pipe or a harp, how shall it be known what is piped or harped unless a distinction is made between the sounds?"},{"num":8,"verse":"And also if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to battle?"},{"num":9,"verse":"So likewise you, by the tongue, unless you utter words that are understood, how shall it be known what is spoken?
