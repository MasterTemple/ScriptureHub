[For] Those who ·have the gift of speaking in different languages [or speak with ecstatic utterance; speak in a tongue; 12:10, 29, 30; 13:1] are not speaking to people; they are speaking to God. No one understands them; they are speaking ·secret things [mysteries] ·through [by; in; with] the Spirit.
