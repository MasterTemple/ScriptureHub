"},{"num":4,"verse":"He who speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. "},{"num":5,"verse":"I desire that you all speak in tongues, but even more that you prophesy. For greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edification."},{"num":6,"verse":"Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you by revelation or knowledge or prophesying or doctrine?
