[{"header":"Using Spiritual Gifts in Love to Benefit the Church"},{"num":14,"verse":"Keep on pursuing love, and eagerly seek spiritual gifts, but especially prophecy. "},{"num":2,"verse":"For the person who speaks in a tongue speaks to God, not to people. For no one understands him, but he speaks mysteries in the Spirit. "},{"num":3,"verse":"However, the person who prophesies speaks to people things that edify, encourage, and comfort. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. "},{"num":5,"verse":"I would like all of you to speak in tongues, but I would prefer that you prophesy. For the person who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may be built up."},{"num":6,"verse":"Brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what good will I do you, unless I communicate to you a revelation, or some knowledge, or a prophecy, or some teaching? "},{"num":7,"verse":"Even lifeless instruments that produce sound, such as a flute or a harp, if they do not make the notes distinct from one another, how will anyone know what is being played on the flute or harp?

"},{"num":9,"verse":"So also with you: Unless you use your tongue to produce intelligible speech, how will anyone know what is being spoken? To be sure, you will be speaking only into the air."},{"num":10,"verse":"There are perhaps ever so many kinds of languages in the world, and not one of them is without meaning.

"},{"num":12,"verse":"So also with you: Since you are eager for spiritual gifts, seek to use them abundantly in a way that will build up the church."},{"num":13,"verse":"That is why a person who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. "},{"num":15,"verse":"So what is to be done? I will pray using my spirit, and I will pray also using my understanding. I will sing using my spirit, and I will sing also using my understanding.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"To be sure, you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. "},{"num":18,"verse":"I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.

"},{"num":21,"verse":"It is written in the law, “By different tongues and by foreign lips I will speak to this people, and even so, they will not listen to me, says the Lord.” "},{"num":22,"verse":"Therefore, tongues are a sign meant for unbelievers, not believers, whereas prophecy is for believers, not unbelievers.

When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, or a teaching, or a revelation, or an utterance in a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done in a way that builds people up. "},{"num":27,"verse":"If someone speaks in a tongue, limit it to two or at most three (speaking one at a time), and have one person interpret.
