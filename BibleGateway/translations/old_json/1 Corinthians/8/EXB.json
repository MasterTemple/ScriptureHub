[{"header":"About Food Offered to Idols"},{"num":8,"verse":"Now ·I will write about [or concerning your question about; concerning; see 7:1; 12:1; 16:1] meat that is sacrificed to idols. We know that “we all have knowledge [probably a slogan used by the Corinthians; see 6:12, 13; 7:1; 8:4; 10:23].” Knowledge puffs you up with pride, but love builds up.
