[{"header":"Chapter 10"},{"num":1,"verse":"Warning Against Overconfidence. I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea, "},{"num":2,"verse":"and all of them were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. "},{"num":3,"verse":"All ate the same spiritual food, "},{"num":4,"verse":"and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was the Christ. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Yet God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the desert."},{"num":6,"verse":"These things happened as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil things, as they did. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And do not become idolaters, as some of them did, as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Let us not indulge in immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell within a single day.

"},{"num":11,"verse":"These things happened to them as an example, and they have been written down as a warning to us, upon whom the end of the ages has come. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Therefore, whoever thinks he is standing secure should take care not to fall. "},{"num":13,"verse":"No trial has come to you but what is human. God is faithful and will not let you be tried beyond your strength; but with the trial he will also provide a way out, so that you may be able to bear it."},{"num":14,"verse":"Therefore, my beloved, avoid idolatry. "},{"num":15,"verse":"I am speaking as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I am saying. "},{"num":16,"verse":"The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? "},{"num":17,"verse":"Because the loaf of bread is one, we, though many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf."},{"num":18,"verse":"Look at Israel according to the flesh; are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? "},{"num":19,"verse":"So what am I saying? That meat sacrificed to idols is anything? Or that an idol is anything? "},{"num":20,"verse":"No, I mean that what they sacrifice, [they sacrifice] to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to become participants with demons. "},{"num":21,"verse":"You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and also the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons.
