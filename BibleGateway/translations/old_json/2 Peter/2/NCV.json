[{"header":"False Teachers"},{"num":2,"verse":"There used to be false prophets among God’s people, just as you will have some false teachers in your group.

So they will bring quick ruin on themselves. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Many will follow their evil ways and say evil things about the way of truth. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Those false teachers only want your money, so they will use you by telling you lies. Their judgment spoken against them long ago is still coming, and their ruin is certain."},{"num":4,"verse":"When angels sinned, God did not let them go free without punishment. He sent them to hell and put them in caves of darkness where they are being held for judgment. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And God punished the world long ago when he brought a flood to the world that was full of people who were against him. But God saved Noah, who preached about being right with God, and seven other people with him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And God also destroyed the evil cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them until they were ashes. He made those cities an example of what will happen to those who are against God. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But he saved Lot from those cities. Lot, a good man, was troubled because of the filthy lives of evil people. "},{"num":8,"verse":"(Lot was a good man, but because he lived with evil people every day, his good heart was hurt by the evil things he saw and heard.)

"},{"num":12,"verse":"But these people speak against things they do not understand. They are like animals that act without thinking, animals born to be caught and killed. And, like animals, these false teachers will be destroyed. "},{"num":13,"verse":"They have caused many people to suffer, so they themselves will suffer. That is their pay for what they have done. They take pleasure in openly doing evil, so they are like dirty spots and stains among you. They delight in deceiving you while eating meals with you.

But if they return to evil things and those things control them, then it is worse for them than it was before.
