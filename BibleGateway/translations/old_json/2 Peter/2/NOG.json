[{"header":"Warnings about False Teachers"},{"num":2,"verse":"False prophets were among God’s people in the past, as false teachers will be among you.

"},{"num":3,"verse":"In their greed they will use good-sounding arguments to exploit you. The verdict against them from long ago is still in force, and their destruction is not asleep."},{"num":4,"verse":"God didn’t spare angels who sinned. He threw them into hell, where he has secured them with chains of darkness and is holding them for judgment."},{"num":5,"verse":"God didn’t spare the ancient world either.

Noah was his messenger who told people about the kind of life that has God’s approval."},{"num":6,"verse":"God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and destroyed them by burning them to ashes. He made those cities an example to ungodly people of what is going to happen to them. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Yet, God rescued Lot, a man who had his approval.
