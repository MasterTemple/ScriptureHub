"},{"num":2,"verse":"I want you to ·think about [remember; recall] the words the holy prophets spoke in the past, and remember the command our Lord and Savior gave us through your apostles [Jude 17]. "},{"num":3,"verse":"It is most important for you to understand what will happen in the last days. ·People [Scoffers] will ·laugh at [scoff at; ridicule] you. They will ·live doing the evil things they want to do [indulge their own desires/lusts; Jude 18]. "},{"num":4,"verse":"[And] They will say, “·Jesus promised to come again.

By the word of God heaven ·was made [came to be; Gen. 1:3–20; Ps. 33:6; 148:5; Heb. 11:3], and the earth was made from water [Gen. 1:2; Ps. 24:2] and with water [Gen. 1:6–7, 9; Ps. 33:7; 136:6; Prov. 8:27–29].

"},{"num":15,"verse":"·Remember [Consider; Bear in mind] that ·we are saved because our Lord is patient [our Lord’s patience is our salvation; his delay in coming allows more to be saved]. Our ·dear [beloved] brother Paul told you the same thing when he wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him. "},{"num":16,"verse":"He writes about ·this [these things] in all his letters. Some things in Paul’s letters are hard to understand, and people who are ·ignorant [untaught] and ·weak in faith [unstable] ·explain these things falsely [twist/distort them]. They also ·falsely explain [twist; distort] the other Scriptures, ·but they are destroying themselves by doing this [or which will lead to their destruction]."},{"num":17,"verse":"[Therefore] ·Dear friends [Beloved], since you already ·know [are forewarned] about this, be ·careful [on guard].
