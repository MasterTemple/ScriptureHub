Bring me the results so that I may know how many people there are.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Joab responded, “May Yahweh multiply his people a hundred times over. But, Your Majesty, aren’t they all your servants? Why are you trying to do this? Why do you wish to make Israel guilty of this sin?”"},{"num":4,"verse":"However, the king overruled Joab. So Joab left, went throughout Israel, and returned to Jerusalem. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Joab reported the census figures to David: In Israel there were 1,100,000 men who could serve in the army, and in Judah there were 470,000 who could serve in the army.

Forgive me because I have acted very foolishly.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Yahweh spoke to Gad, David’s seer.

But don’t let me fall into human hands.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"So Yahweh sent a plague on Israel, and 70,000 Israelites died. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Elohim also sent a Messenger to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was destroying it, Yahweh reconsidered and changed his mind about the disaster. “Enough!” he said to the destroying Messenger. “Put down your weapon.” The Messenger of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."},{"num":16,"verse":"When David looked up, he saw the Messenger of Yahweh standing between heaven and earth.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"David said to Elohim, “I’m the one who ordered the people to be counted. I am the one who sinned and did wrong. What have these sheep done? Yahweh my Elohim, let your punishment be against me and my father’s family, but don’t punish your people with a plague.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Yahweh’s Messenger told Gad to tell David to go and set up an altar for Yahweh at Ornan the Jebusite’s threshing floor.

I’ll give you oxen for the burnt offering, threshers for firewood, and wheat for the grain offering. I’ll give you everything.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"“No,” King David told Ornan, “I insist on buying it for the full price. I won’t take what is yours for Yahweh and offer burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.” "},{"num":25,"verse":"So David gave Ornan 15 pounds of gold for that place."},{"num":26,"verse":"David built an altar for Yahweh there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
