[{"num":21,"verse":"The Adversary  now rose up against Isra’el and incited David to take a census of Isra’el.

But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants in any case? Why does my lord the king require this? Why should he bring guilt upon Isra’el?” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Yo’av. So Yo’av left and went through all Isra’el, after which he came to Yerushalayim."},{"num":5,"verse":"Yo’av reported the results of the census to David: in Isra’el were 1,100,000 men who could handle a sword, while Y’hudah had 470,000 men who could handle a sword.

Now think about what answer I should give to the one who sent me.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"David said to Gad, “This is very hard for me. Let me fall into the hand of Adonai, because his mercies are very great, rather than have me fall into the hand of man.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"So Adonai sent a plague on Isra’el; 70,000 of the people of Isra’el died."},{"num":15,"verse":"God also sent an angel to destroy Yerushalayim, but when he was about to carry out the destruction, Adonai saw it and changed his mind about causing such distress; so he said to the destroying angel, “Enough!
