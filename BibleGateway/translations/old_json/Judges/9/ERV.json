Remember, I am your relative.’”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Abimelech’s uncles spoke to the leaders of Shechem and asked them that question. The leaders of Shechem decided to follow Abimelech. They said, “After all, he is our brother.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"So the leaders of Shechem gave Abimelech 70 pieces of silver. That silver was from the temple of the god Baal Berith.
