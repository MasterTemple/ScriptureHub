That 70 men, each of them Jerubbaal’s sons, rule over you? Or that one man rule over you?’ Keep in mind that I’m like your own close relative.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"So his mother’s relatives spoke all of this on his behalf in the presence of all the “lords” of Shechem. Since they were inclined to follow Abimelech, they said, “He’s our relative!” "},{"num":4,"verse":"and they gave him 70 silver coins from the temple that they had built to Baal-berith. Abimelech hired some worthless and useless men, who followed him "},{"num":5,"verse":"to his father’s house in Ophrah. There he murdered his own brothers, Jerubbaal’s sons—all 70 of them—in one place. But Jerubbaal’s youngest son Jotham survived by hiding himself."},{"num":6,"verse":"All the men from Shechem and Beth-millo gathered together and set up Abimelech as king near the pillar erected in Shechem.
