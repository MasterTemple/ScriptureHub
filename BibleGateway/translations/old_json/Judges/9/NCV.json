And they decided to follow Abimelech, because they said, “He is our relative.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"So the leaders of Shechem gave Abimelech about one and three-quarter pounds of silver from the temple of the god Baal-Berith. Abimelech used the silver to hire some worthless, reckless men, who followed him wherever he went. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He went to Ophrah, the hometown of his father, and murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Gideon. He killed them all on one stone. But Gideon’s youngest son, Jotham, hid from Abimelech and escaped. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Then all of the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree standing in Shechem.

"},{"num":24,"verse":"Abimelech had killed Gideon’s seventy sons, his own brothers, and the leaders of Shechem had helped him. So God sent the evil spirit to punish them. "},{"num":25,"verse":"The leaders of Shechem were against Abimelech then. They put men on the hilltops in ambush who robbed everyone going by. And Abimelech was told."},{"num":26,"verse":"A man named Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers moved into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem trusted him. "},{"num":27,"verse":"They went out to the vineyards to pick grapes, and they squeezed the grapes. Then they had a feast in the temple of their god, where they ate and drank and cursed Abimelech. "},{"num":28,"verse":"Gaal son of Ebed said, “We are the men of Shechem. Who is Abimelech that we should serve him? Isn’t he one of Gideon’s sons, and isn’t Zebul his officer? We should serve the men of Hamor, Shechem’s father. Why should we serve Abimelech? "},{"num":29,"verse":"If you made me commander of these people, I would get rid of Abimelech. I would say to him, ‘Get your army ready and come out to battle.’”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Now when Zebul, the ruler of Shechem, heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry.

There are people coming down from the mountains!”"},{"num":37,"verse":"But again Gaal said, “Look, there are people coming down from the center of the land, and there is a group coming from the fortune-tellers’ tree!”"},{"num":38,"verse":"Zebul said to Gaal, “Where is your bragging now? You said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ You made fun of these men. Now go out and fight them.”"},{"num":39,"verse":"So Gaal led the men of Shechem out to fight Abimelech. "},{"num":40,"verse":"Abimelech and his men chased them, and many of Gaal’s men were killed before they could get back to the city gate. "},{"num":41,"verse":"While Abimelech stayed at Arumah, Zebul forced Gaal and his brothers to leave Shechem."},{"num":42,"verse":"The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields.

Then he tore it down and threw salt over the ruins."},{"header":"The Tower of Shechem Burns"},{"num":46,"verse":"When the leaders who were in the Tower of Shechem heard what had happened to Shechem, they gathered in the safest room of the temple of El Berith. "},{"num":47,"verse":"Abimelech heard that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem had gathered there. "},{"num":48,"verse":"So he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon, near Shechem. Abimelech took an ax and cut some branches and put them on his shoulders. He said to all those with him, “Hurry! Do what I have done!” "},{"num":49,"verse":"So all those men cut branches and followed Abimelech and piled them against the safest room of the temple. Then they set them on fire and burned the people inside. So all the people who were at the Tower of Shechem also died—about a thousand men and women."},{"header":"Abimelech’s Death"},{"num":50,"verse":"Then Abimelech went to the city of Thebez. He surrounded the city, attacked it, and captured it. "},{"num":51,"verse":"But inside the city was a strong tower, so all the men, women, and leaders of that city ran to the tower. When they got inside, they locked the door behind them. Then they climbed up to the roof of the tower. "},{"num":52,"verse":"Abimelech came to the tower to attack it. He approached the door of the tower to set it on fire, "},{"num":53,"verse":"but as he came near, a woman dropped a grinding stone on his head, crushing his skull."},{"num":54,"verse":"He quickly called to the officer who carried his armor and said, “Take out your sword and kill me.
