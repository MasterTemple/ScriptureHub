"},{"num":35,"verse":"Now Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and the people who were with him emerged from the ambush. "},{"num":36,"verse":"When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!”"},{"num":37,"verse":"Then Gaal spoke up again and said, “Look, people are coming down from the middle of the land, and one column is coming by the road of the Diviner’s Oak.”"},{"num":38,"verse":"Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your mouth now? With it you said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you have trashed?

"},{"num":45,"verse":"So Abimelech fought against the city all that day, captured the city and killed the people that were in it. Then he razed the city and sowed it with salt."},{"num":46,"verse":"Now when all the lords of Shechem’s Tower heard about it, they went into the vault of the temple of El-berith. "},{"num":47,"verse":"When Abimelech was told that all the lords of Shechem’s Tower had gathered there, "},{"num":48,"verse":"he and all the people with him went up to Mount Zalmon. Then Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees and lifted it up and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you’ve seen me do, hurry and do likewise.” "},{"num":49,"verse":"So all the people likewise each cut down his branch and followed Abimelech. He laid them against the vault and set the vault on fire over them. So all the people of Shechem’s Tower also died—about a thousand men and women."},{"num":50,"verse":"Then Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against Thebez and captured it. "},{"num":51,"verse":"But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the city leaders fled there and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower.
