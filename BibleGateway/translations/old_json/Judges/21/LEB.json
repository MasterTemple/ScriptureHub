"},{"num":3,"verse":"And they said, “Why, Yahweh, God of Israel, has it happened today in Israel that one tribe is lacking from Israel?” "},{"num":4,"verse":"On the next day the people rose early, and they built there an altar and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And the Israelites said, “Who in the assembly has not come up from all the tribes of Israel to Yahweh?” For a solemn oath was taken concerning whoever did not come up to Yahweh at Mizpah, saying, “He will certainly be put to death.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"But the Israelites had compassion for Benjamin, their relatives, and they said, “Today one tribe is cut off from Israel.
