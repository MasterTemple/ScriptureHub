Then the priest said unto them, What are you doing?"},{"num":19,"verse":"And they said unto him, Silence, lay thy hand upon thy mouth and go with us to be our father and priest; is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family of Israel?"},{"num":20,"verse":"And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the people."},{"num":21,"verse":"So they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the baggage before them."},{"num":22,"verse":"And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together and overtook the sons of Dan."},{"num":23,"verse":"And they cried unto the sons of Dan.
