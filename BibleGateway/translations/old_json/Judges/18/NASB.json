And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?”"},{"num":4,"verse":"He said to them, “Micah has done this and that for me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Then they said to him, “Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether our way on which we are going will be successful.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"And the priest said to them, “Go in peace; your way in which you are going has the Lord’s approval.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"So the five men departed and came to Laish, and saw the people who were in it living in security, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting; for there was no oppressive ruler humiliating them for anything in the land, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone."},{"num":8,"verse":"When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, “What do you say?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"And they said, “Arise, and let’s go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you sit still? Do not hesitate to go, to enter, to take possession of the land."},{"num":10,"verse":"When you enter, you will come to an unsuspecting people with a spacious land; for God has handed it over to you, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Then from the family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out."},{"num":12,"verse":"They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah.

Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”"},{"num":20,"verse":"The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image, and went among the people."},{"num":21,"verse":"Then they turned and left, and put the children, the livestock, and the valuables in front of them."},{"num":22,"verse":"When they had distanced themselves from Micah’s house, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house assembled by command and overtook the sons of Dan."},{"num":23,"verse":"Then they called out to the sons of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you, that you have assembled together?”"},{"num":24,"verse":"And he said, “You have taken my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away; what more do I have?
