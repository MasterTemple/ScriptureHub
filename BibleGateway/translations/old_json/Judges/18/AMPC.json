[{"num":18,"verse":"In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until then no [sufficient] inheritance had been acquired by them among the tribes of Israel."},{"num":2,"verse":"So the Danites sent from the whole number of their tribe five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and to explore it, and they said to them, Go, explore the land. They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there."},{"num":3,"verse":"When they went by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite, and they turned aside there and said to him, Who brought you here? And what do you do in this place? And what have you here?"},{"num":4,"verse":"And he said to them, Thus and thus Micah deals with me and has hired me, and I am his priest."},{"num":5,"verse":"And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God that we may know whether our journey will be successful."},{"num":6,"verse":"And the priest said to them, Go in peace. The way in which you go is before (under the eye of) the Lord."},{"num":7,"verse":"Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, how they dwelt securely after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and feeling safe; and there was no magistrate in the land, who might put them to shame in anything or injure them; and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone."},{"num":8,"verse":"The five men came back to their brethren at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren said to them, What do you say?"},{"num":9,"verse":"They said, Arise, let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very fertile.

Now therefore, consider what you have to do."},{"num":15,"verse":"And they turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and saluted him."},{"num":16,"verse":"Now the 600 Danites with their weapons of war stood at Micah’s gate."},{"num":17,"verse":"And the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up and entered the house and took the graven image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war."},{"num":18,"verse":"And when these went into Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, What are you doing?"},{"num":19,"verse":"And they said to him, Be still, put your hand over your mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?"},{"num":20,"verse":"And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people."},{"num":21,"verse":"So they turned and departed and put the little ones, the cattle, and the baggage in front of them."},{"num":22,"verse":"When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were Micah’s near neighbors were called out and overtook the Danites."},{"num":23,"verse":"They shouted to the Danites, who turned and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with such a company?"},{"num":24,"verse":"And he said, You take away my gods which I made and the priest, and go away; and what have I left?
