Up to that time no territory had been captured by them among the tribes of Israel. "},{"num":2,"verse":"So the Danites sent out five brave men from all their clans, from Zorah and Eshtaol, to scout out the land and explore it. They told them, “Go and explore the land.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"While they were near Micah’s home, they recognized the speech of the young Levite.

What is keeping you here?” "},{"num":4,"verse":"He told them what Micah had done for him and that he had hired him as his priest."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God so we will know if we will have a successful journey.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"The priest told them, “Go in peace. The Lord is watching over the journey you are going on.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The five men left and came to Laish.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"The 600 Danite men were standing by the entrance of the gate, armed with their weapons of war. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Then the five men who had gone to scout out the land went in and took the carved image overlaid with silver, the ephod, and the household idols, while the priest was standing by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war."},{"num":18,"verse":"When they entered Micah’s house and took the carved image overlaid with silver, the ephod, and the household idols, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”"},{"num":19,"verse":"They told him, “Be quiet. Keep your mouth shut. Come with us and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest for the house of one person or for you to be a priest for a tribe and family in Israel?” "},{"num":20,"verse":"So the priest was pleased and took his ephod, household idols, and carved image, and went with the people.

They killed them with their swords and burned down the city. "},{"num":28,"verse":"There was no one to rescue them because it was far from Sidon and they had no alliance with anyone. It was in a valley that belonged to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the city and lived in it. "},{"num":29,"verse":"They named the city Dan, after the name of their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel.
