"},{"num":2,"verse":"And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand foot soldiers who drew the sword. "},{"num":3,"verse":"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.)"},{"num":4,"verse":"So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, “My concubine and I went into Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to spend the night. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me, but instead they ravished my concubine so that she died. "},{"num":6,"verse":"So I took hold of my concubine, cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel, because they committed lewdness and outrage in Israel.

"},{"num":30,"verse":"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times. "},{"num":31,"verse":"So the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down and kill some of the people, as at the other times, in the highways (one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah) and in the field, about thirty men of Israel. "},{"num":32,"verse":"And the children of Benjamin said, “They are defeated before us, as at first.”"},{"num":33,"verse":"So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar.

But the Benjamites did not know that disaster was upon them. "},{"num":35,"verse":"The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel. And the children of Israel destroyed that day twenty-five thousand one hundred Benjamites; all these drew the sword."},{"num":36,"verse":"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. The men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites, because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah. "},{"num":37,"verse":"And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush spread out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword. "},{"num":38,"verse":"Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise up from the city, "},{"num":39,"verse":"whereupon the men of Israel would turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel. For they said, “Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.” "},{"num":40,"verse":"But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and there was the whole city going up in smoke to heaven. "},{"num":41,"verse":"And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin panicked, for they saw that disaster had come upon them.
