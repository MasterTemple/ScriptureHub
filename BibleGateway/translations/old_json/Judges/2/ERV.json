[{"header":"The Angel of the Lord at Bokim"},{"num":2,"verse":"The angel of the Lord went up to the city of Bokim from the city of Gilgal.

I told you I would never break my agreement with you."},{"num":2,"verse":"But in return, you must never make any agreement with the people living in that land. You must destroy their altars. I told you that, but you didn’t obey me."},{"num":3,"verse":"“Now I will tell you this, ‘I will not force the other people to leave this land any longer. These people will become a problem for you. They will be like a trap to you. Their false gods will become like a net to trap you.’”"},{"num":4,"verse":"After the angel gave the Israelites this message from the Lord, the people cried loudly."},{"num":5,"verse":"So they named the place Bokim.

These old men had seen all the great things the Lord had done for the Israelites."},{"num":8,"verse":"Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 years."},{"num":9,"verse":"The Israelites buried Joshua on the land that he had been given. That was at Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash."},{"num":10,"verse":"After that whole generation died, the next generation grew up. This new generation did not know about the Lord or what he had done for the Israelites."},{"num":11,"verse":"So the Israelites did something very evil before the Lord. They began serving the false god Baal."},{"num":12,"verse":"It was the Lord, the God their ancestors worshiped, who had brought the Israelites out of Egypt.

These leaders saved the Israelites from the enemies who took their possessions."},{"num":17,"verse":"But the Israelites did not listen to their judges.

They have not listened to me."},{"num":21,"verse":"So I will no longer defeat the nations and clear the way for the Israelites. Those nations were still in this land when Joshua died, and I will let them stay in this land."},{"num":22,"verse":"I will use them to test the Israelites. I will see if the Israelites can keep the Lord’s commands as their ancestors did.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"The Lord allowed those nations to stay in the land. He did not quickly force them to leave the country. He did not help Joshua’s army defeat them."}]
