When they grew up the sons of the wife had driven Jephthah away, saying to him, “You shall inherit nothing in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"So Jephthah had fled from his brothers and taken up residence in the land of Tob. Worthless men had joined company with him, and went out with him on raids."},{"num":4,"verse":"Some time later, the Ammonites went to war with Israel. "},{"num":5,"verse":"As soon as the Ammonites were at war with Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob.
