[{"num":10,"verse":"The Jewish Law is not a full and faithful model of the real things; it is only a faint outline of the good things to come. The same sacrifices are offered forever, year after year. How can the Law, then, by means of these sacrifices make perfect the people who come to God? "},{"num":2,"verse":"If the people worshiping God had really been purified from their sins, they would not feel guilty of sin any more, and all sacrifices would stop.

"},{"num":9,"verse":"Then he said, “Here I am, O God, to do your will.” So God does away with all the old sacrifices and puts the sacrifice of Christ in their place. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Because Jesus Christ did what God wanted him to do, we are all purified from sin by the offering that he made of his own body once and for all."},{"num":11,"verse":"Every Jewish priest performs his services every day and offers the same sacrifices many times; but these sacrifices can never take away sins. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Christ, however, offered one sacrifice for sins, an offering that is effective forever, and then he sat down at the right side of God. "},{"num":13,"verse":"There he now waits until God puts his enemies as a footstool under his feet. "},{"num":14,"verse":"With one sacrifice, then, he has made perfect forever those who are purified from sin."},{"num":15,"verse":"And the Holy Spirit also gives us his witness. First he says,"},{"num":17,"verse":"And then he says, “I will not remember their sins and evil deeds any longer.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"So when these have been forgiven, an offering to take away sins is no longer needed."},{"header":"Let Us Come Near to God"},{"num":19,"verse":"We have, then, my friends, complete freedom to go into the Most Holy Place by means of the death of Jesus.

Instead, let us encourage one another all the more, since you see that the Day of the Lord is coming nearer."},{"num":26,"verse":"For there is no longer any sacrifice that will take away sins if we purposely go on sinning after the truth has been made known to us.
