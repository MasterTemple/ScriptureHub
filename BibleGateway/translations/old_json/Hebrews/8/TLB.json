[{"num":8,"verse":"What we are saying is this: Christ, whose priesthood we have just described, is our High Priest and is in heaven at the place of greatest honor next to God himself. "},{"num":2,"verse":"He ministers in the temple in heaven, the true place of worship built by the Lord and not by human hands."},{"num":3,"verse":"And since every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices, Christ must make an offering too. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The sacrifice he offers is far better than those offered by the earthly priests. (But even so, if he were here on earth he wouldn’t even be permitted to be a priest because down here the priests still follow the old Jewish system of sacrifices.) "},{"num":5,"verse":"Their work is connected with a mere earthly model of the real tabernacle in heaven; for when Moses was getting ready to build the tabernacle, God warned him to follow exactly the pattern of the heavenly tabernacle as shown to him on Mount Sinai. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But Christ, as a Minister in heaven, has been rewarded with a far more important work than those who serve under the old laws because the new agreement that he passes on to us from God contains far more wonderful promises."},{"num":7,"verse":"The old agreement didn’t even work. If it had, there would have been no need for another to replace it.

"},{"num":11,"verse":"And no one then will need to speak to his friend or neighbor or brother, saying, ‘You, too, should know the Lord,’ because everyone, great and small, will know me already.
