Also there was the Ark of the Covenant that held the old agreement. The Ark of the Covenant was covered with gold. Inside this Ark of the Covenant was a golden jar of manna and Aaron’s rod—the rod that once grew leaves. Also in it were the stone tablets of the old agreement.

But we cannot tell everything about these things now."},{"num":6,"verse":"Everything in the Tent was made ready in this way. Then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But only the high priest could go into the second room, and he did that only once a year. He could never enter the inner room without taking blood with him. He offered that blood to God for himself and for the people’s sins. These were sins people did without knowing that they were sinning.

Those who are called by God can now receive the blessings that God has promised. These blessings will last forever.
