[{"header":"The Earthly and the Heavenly Sanctuaries"},{"num":9,"verse":"Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. "},{"num":2,"verse":"For a tent was prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy Place. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies, "},{"num":4,"verse":"having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; "},{"num":5,"verse":"above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail."},{"num":6,"verse":"These preparations having thus been made, the priests go continually into the outer tent, performing their ritual duties; "},{"num":7,"verse":"but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people. "},{"num":8,"verse":"By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary is not yet opened as long as the outer tent is still standing "},{"num":9,"verse":"(which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, "},{"num":10,"verse":"but deal only with food and drink and various ablutions, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation."},{"num":11,"verse":"But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) "},{"num":12,"verse":"he entered once for all into the Holy Place, taking not the blood of goats and calves but his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh, "},{"num":14,"verse":"how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God."},{"num":15,"verse":"Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred which redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant. "},{"num":16,"verse":"For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. "},{"num":17,"verse":"For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Hence even the first covenant was not ratified without blood.
