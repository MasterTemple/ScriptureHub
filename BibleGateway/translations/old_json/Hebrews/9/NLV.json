"},{"num":3,"verse":"Behind the second curtain there was another tent. This was called the Holiest Place of All. "},{"num":4,"verse":"In the inside tent there was an altar where special perfume was burned. There was also a large box made of wood called the box of the Way of Worship. Both of these were covered with gold inside and out. Inside the box was a pot made of gold with the bread from heaven. It also had in it Aaron’s stick that once started to grow. The stones on which the Law of Moses was written were in it. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Above the box were the cherubim of honor. Their wings were spread up and over and met in the center. On the top of the box and under the shadow of their wings was the mercy-seat. We cannot tell anymore about these things now."},{"num":6,"verse":"When everything was finished, the Jewish religious leaders went in and out of the outside tent to do the things which had to be done to worship God. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Once each year the head religious leader would go into the inside tent alone. He would not go in without blood. He gave this blood to God as a gift in worship for his own sins and for the sins of all the people who sinned without knowing it."},{"num":8,"verse":"And so the Holy Spirit is teaching that, with the Old Way of Worship, the people could not go into the Holiest Place of All as long as the outside tent and its Old Way of Worship were being used.

"},{"num":10,"verse":"The Old Way of Worship was made up of Laws about what to eat and drink. These Laws told how to wash and other things to do with the body. These things had to be done until Christ came to bring a better way of worship."},{"header":"The New Way of Worship Has a Better Gift"},{"num":11,"verse":"But Christ came as the Head Religious Leader of the good things God promised. He made the way for man to go to God. He was a greater and more perfect tent. He was not made by human hands and was not a part of this earth. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Christ went into the Holiest Place of All one time for all people. He did not take the blood of goats and young cows to give to God as a gift in worship. He gave His own blood. By doing this, He bought us with His own blood and made us free from sin forever. "},{"num":13,"verse":"With the Old Way of Worship, the blood and ashes of animals could make men clean after they had sinned. "},{"num":14,"verse":"How much more the blood of Christ will do! He gave Himself as a perfect gift to God through the Spirit that lives forever. Now your heart can be free from the guilty feeling of doing work that is worth nothing. Now you can work for the living God."},{"num":15,"verse":"Christ is the One Who gave us this New Way of Worship. All those who have been called by God may receive life that lasts forever just as He promised them. Christ bought us with His blood when He died for us.

He gave Himself to destroy sin. "},{"num":27,"verse":"It is in the plan that all men die once. After that, they will stand before God and be judged. "},{"num":28,"verse":"It is the same with Christ.
