In the chest there was a gold jar containing manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant."},{"num":5,"verse":"Above the chest there were magnificent winged creatures casting their shadow over the seat of the chest, where sin is taken care of. Right now we can’t talk about these things in detail."},{"num":6,"verse":"When these things have been prepared in this way, priests enter the first tent all the time as they perform their service."},{"num":7,"verse":"But only the high priest enters the second tent once a year.

It shows that the gifts and sacrifices that are being offered can’t perfect the conscience of the one who is serving."},{"num":10,"verse":"These are superficial regulations that are only about food, drink, and various ritual ways to wash with water. They are regulations that have been imposed until the time of the new order."},{"num":11,"verse":"But Christ has appeared as the high priest of the good things that have happened. He passed through the greater and more perfect meeting tent, which isn’t made by human hands (that is, it’s not a part of this world)."},{"num":12,"verse":"He entered the holy of holies once for all by his own blood, not by the blood of goats or calves, securing our deliverance for all time."},{"num":13,"verse":"If the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkled ashes of cows made spiritually contaminated people holy and clean,"},{"num":14,"verse":"how much more will the blood of Jesus wash our consciences clean from dead works in order to serve the living God?
