[{"header":"The Old Agreement"},{"num":9,"verse":"The first agreement had rules for worship and a place on earth for worship. "},{"num":2,"verse":"The Holy Tent was set up for this.

Inside this Ark was a golden jar of manna, Aaron’s rod that once grew leaves, and the stone tablets of the old agreement.

But we cannot tell everything about these things now."},{"num":6,"verse":"When everything in the Tent was made ready in this way, the priests went into the first room every day to worship. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But only the high priest could go into the second room, and he did that only once a year. He could never enter the inner room without taking blood with him, which he offered to God for himself and for sins the people did without knowing they did them.

They were rules for the body, to be followed until the time of God’s new way."},{"header":"The New Agreement"},{"num":11,"verse":"But when Christ came as the high priest of the good things we now have, he entered the greater and more perfect tent.

His blood will make our consciences pure from useless acts so we may serve the living God."},{"num":15,"verse":"For this reason Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people. Those who are called by God can now receive the blessings he has promised, blessings that will last forever.
