His name first means “king of righteousness,” and then “king of Salem,” that is, “king of peace.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Without father, or mother, or genealogy, and without beginning of days or end of life, thus bearing a resemblance to the Son of God, he remains a priest forever."},{"num":4,"verse":"Just consider now how great this man must have been for the patriarch Abraham to give him a tenth of his spoils."},{"num":5,"verse":"The descendants of Levi who succeed to the priestly office are required by the Law to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their fellow countrymen, although they too are descended from Abraham."},{"num":6,"verse":"However, Melchizedek, who was not of the same ancestry, received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had received the promises."},{"num":7,"verse":"It is indisputable that a lesser person is blessed by one who is greater."},{"num":8,"verse":"In the one case, it is ordinary mortal men who receive tithes; in the other, the recipient is one of whom it is attested that he is alive."},{"num":9,"verse":"One could even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, actually paid tithes through Abraham,"},{"num":10,"verse":"inasmuch as he was still in his father’s loins when Melchizedek met Abraham."},{"num":11,"verse":"Another High Priest according to the Order of Melchizedek. If perfection was therefore achieved through the Levitical priesthood, on the basis of which the Law was given to the people, what need would there have been for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek rather than one according to the order of Aaron?"},{"num":12,"verse":"For when there is any change in the priesthood, there must also be a change in the Law."},{"num":13,"verse":"Now the one about whom these things were said belonged to a different tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar."},{"num":14,"verse":"For it is clear that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe about which Moses said nothing in regard to priests."},{"num":15,"verse":"This becomes even more obvious now that another priest has arisen, one like Melchizedek,"},{"num":16,"verse":"who was one not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent, but by the power of an indestructible life."},{"num":17,"verse":"For it is attested of him:"},{"num":18,"verse":"The earlier commandment is abrogated because of its weakness and ineffectiveness,"},{"num":19,"verse":"since the Law brought nothing to perfection.
