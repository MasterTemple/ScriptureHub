Abraham gave him one-tenth part of all he had taken in the war. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The Law made the family of Levi the Jewish religious leaders. The Law said that the religious leaders were to take one-tenth part of everything from their own people.

He was still inside Abraham’s body when Abraham paid Melchizedek."},{"num":11,"verse":"The Law was given during the time when Levi and his sons were the religious leaders. If the work of those religious leaders had been perfect in taking away the sins of the people, there would have been no need for another religious leader. But one like Melchizedek was needed and not one from the family group of Aaron. "},{"num":12,"verse":"For when the family group of religious leaders changed, the Law had to be changed also.

Jesus is holy and has no guilt. He has never sinned and is different from sinful men. He has the place of honor above the heavens. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Christ is not like other religious leaders. They had to give gifts every day on the altar in worship for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. Christ did not have to do that.
