In the end, it will be burned."},{"num":9,"verse":"Dear friends, we have to say these things. But we are sure of better things in your case. We are talking about the things that have to do with being saved. "},{"num":10,"verse":"God is fair. He will not forget what you have done. He will remember the love you have shown him.
