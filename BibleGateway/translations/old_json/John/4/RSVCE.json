[{"header":"Jesus and the Woman of Samaria"},{"num":4,"verse":"Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John "},{"num":2,"verse":"(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), "},{"num":3,"verse":"he left Judea and departed again to Galilee. "},{"num":4,"verse":"He had to pass through Samar′ia. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So he came to a city of Samar′ia, called Sy′char, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

It was about the sixth hour."},{"num":7,"verse":"There came a woman of Samar′ia to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. "},{"num":9,"verse":"The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samar′ia?” For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” "},{"num":11,"verse":"The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; where do you get that living water? "},{"num":12,"verse":"Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?” "},{"num":13,"verse":"Jesus said to her, “Every one who drinks of this water will thirst again, "},{"num":14,"verse":"but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst; the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” "},{"num":15,"verse":"The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; "},{"num":18,"verse":"for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband; this you said truly.” "},{"num":19,"verse":"The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. "},{"num":22,"verse":"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. "},{"num":23,"verse":"But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him.
