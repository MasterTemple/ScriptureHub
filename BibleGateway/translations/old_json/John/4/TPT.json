[{"header":"A Thirsty Savior"},{"num":4,"verse":"The news quickly reached the Jewish religious leaders known as the Pharisees that Jesus was drawing greater crowds of followers coming to be baptized than John. "},{"num":2,"verse":"(Although Jesus himself didn’t baptize, but only his disciples.) "},{"num":3,"verse":"Jesus heard what was being said and abruptly left Judea and returned to the province of Galilee, "},{"num":4,"verse":"and he had to pass through Samaria."},{"num":5,"verse":"Jesus arrived at the Samaritan village of Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Wearied by his long journey, he sat on the edge of Jacob’s well, and sent his disciples into the village to buy food, for it was already afternoon."},{"num":9,"verse":"She replied, “Why would a Jewish man ask a Samaritan woman for a drink of water?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)"},{"num":10,"verse":"Jesus replied, “If you only knew who I am and the gift that God wants to give you, you’d ask me for a drink, and I would give you living water.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"The woman replied, “But sir, you don’t even have a bucket, and the well is very deep. So where do you find this ‘living water’? "},{"num":12,"verse":"Do you really think that you are greater than our ancestor Jacob who dug this well and drank from it himself, along with his children and livestock?”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Jesus answered, “If you drink from Jacob’s well, you’ll be thirsty again, "},{"num":14,"verse":"but if anyone drinks the living water I give them, they will never be thirsty again. For when you drink the water I give you, it becomes a gushing fountain of the Holy Spirit, flooding you with endless life!”"},{"num":15,"verse":"The woman replied, “Let me drink that water so I’ll never be thirsty again and won’t have to come back here to draw water.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"Jesus said, “Go get your husband and bring him back here.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"“But I’m not married,” the woman answered."},{"num":18,"verse":"“for you’ve been married five times, and now you’re living with a man who is not your husband. You have told the truth.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"The woman changed the subject. “You must be a prophet! "},{"num":20,"verse":"So tell me this: Why do our fathers worship God on this nearby mountain, but your people teach that Jerusalem is the place where we must worship. Who is right?”"},{"num":21,"verse":"“Believe me, dear woman, the time has come when you will worship the Father neither on a mountain nor in Jerusalem, but in your heart. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Your people don’t really know the One they worship, but we Jews worship out of our experience, for it’s from the Jews that salvation is available. "},{"num":23,"verse":"From now on, worshiping the Father will not be a matter of the right place but with a right heart. For God is a Spirit, and he longs to have sincere worshipers who adore him in the realm of the Spirit and in truth.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"The woman said, “This is all so confusing, but I do know that the Anointed One is coming—the true Messiah. And when he comes, he will tell us everything we need to know.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"Jesus said to her, “You don’t have to wait any longer, the Anointed One is here speaking with you—I am the One you’re looking for.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"At that moment, his disciples returned and were stunned to see Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman, yet none of them dared ask him why or what they were discussing.

Look at all the people coming—now is harvest time! Their hearts are like vast fields of ripened grain—ready for a harvest. "},{"num":36,"verse":"Everyone who reaps these souls for eternal life will receive a reward. Both those who plant spiritual seeds and those who reap the spiritual harvest will celebrate together with great joy!

And now you are privileged to profit from their labors and reap the harvest.”"},{"num":39,"verse":"Many from the Samaritan village became believers in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony: “He told me everything I ever did!” "},{"num":40,"verse":"Then they begged Jesus to stay with them, so he stayed there for two days, "},{"num":41,"verse":"resulting in many more coming to faith in him because of his message."},{"num":42,"verse":"The Samaritans said to the woman, “Now we’ve heard him ourselves.

He met there a governmental official from Capernaum whose son was very sick and dying. When he heard that Jesus had left Judea and was staying in Cana of Galilee, he decided to make the journey to Cana. When he found Jesus, he begged him, “You must come with me to Capernaum and heal my son!”"},{"num":48,"verse":"So Jesus said to him, “You never believe unless you see signs and wonders.”"},{"num":49,"verse":"But the man continued to plead, “Come with me to Capernaum before my little boy dies!”"},{"num":50,"verse":"Jesus looked him in the eyes and said, “Go back home now.
