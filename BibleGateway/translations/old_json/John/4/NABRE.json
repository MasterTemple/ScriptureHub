Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"His disciples had gone into the town to buy food. "},{"num":9,"verse":"The Samaritan woman said to him, “How can you, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?” (For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.)

What you have said is true.” "},{"num":19,"verse":"The woman said to him, “Sir, I can see that you are a prophet. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain; but you people say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. "},{"num":22,"verse":"You people worship what you do not understand; we worship what we understand, because salvation is from the Jews. "},{"num":23,"verse":"But the hour is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth; and indeed the Father seeks such people to worship him.
