I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it up again. This is the commission I received from my Father.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"There was a division among the Jews again because of these words. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is out of his mind! Why listen to him?” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Others said, “These are not the sayings of someone demon-possessed.
