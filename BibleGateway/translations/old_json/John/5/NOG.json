[{"header":"Jesus Cures a Man at the Bethesda Pool"},{"num":5,"verse":"Later, Yeshua went to Jerusalem for a Jewish festival."},{"num":2,"verse":"Near Sheep Gate in Jerusalem was a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew. It had five porches. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Under these porches a large number of sick people—people who were blind, lame, or paralyzed—used to lie. "},{"num":5,"verse":"One man, who had been sick for 38 years, was lying there. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Yeshua saw the man lying there and knew that he had been sick for a long time. So Yeshua asked the man, “Would you like to get well?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The sick man answered Yeshua, “Sir, I don’t have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I’m trying to get there, someone else steps into the pool ahead of me.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Yeshua told the man, “Get up, pick up your cot, and walk.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"The man immediately became well, picked up his cot, and walked."},{"num":10,"verse":"So the Jews told the man who had been healed, “This is a day of worship. You’re not allowed to carry your cot today.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"The man replied, “The man who made me well told me to pick up my cot and walk.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"The Jews asked him, “Who is the man who told you to pick it up and walk?” "},{"num":13,"verse":"But the man who had been healed didn’t know who Yeshua was. (Yeshua had withdrawn from the crowd.)"},{"num":14,"verse":"Later, Yeshua met the man in the temple courtyard and told him, “You’re well now. Stop sinning so that something worse doesn’t happen to you.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"The man went back to the Jews and told them that Yeshua was the man who had made him well."},{"header":"The Son Is Equal to the Father"},{"num":16,"verse":"The Jews began to persecute Yeshua because he kept healing people on the day of worship. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Yeshua replied to them, “My Father is working right now, and so am I.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"His reply made the Jews more intent on killing him. Not only did he break the laws about the day of worship, but also he made himself equal to God when he said repeatedly that God was his Father."},{"num":19,"verse":"Yeshua said to the Jews, “I can guarantee this truth: The Son cannot do anything on his own. He can do only what he sees the Father doing. Indeed, the Son does exactly what the Father does. "},{"num":20,"verse":"The Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. The Father will show him even greater things to do than these things so that you will be amazed. "},{"num":21,"verse":"In the same way that the Father brings back the dead and gives them life, the Son gives life to anyone he chooses."},{"num":22,"verse":"“The Father doesn’t judge anyone. He has entrusted judgment entirely to the Son "},{"num":23,"verse":"so that everyone will honor the Son as they honor the Father. Whoever doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him.

Those who have done good will come back to life and live. But those who have done evil will come back to life and will be judged. "},{"num":30,"verse":"I can’t do anything on my own. As I listen to the Father, I make my judgments. My judgments are right because I don’t try to do what I want but what the one who sent me wants."},{"num":31,"verse":"“If I testify on my own behalf, what I say isn’t true.

For a time you enjoyed the pleasure of his light. "},{"num":36,"verse":"But I have something that testifies more favorably on my behalf than John’s testimony. The tasks that the Father gave me to carry out, these tasks which I perform, testify on my behalf. They prove that the Father has sent me. "},{"num":37,"verse":"The Father who sent me testifies on my behalf. You have never heard his voice, and you have never seen his form.
