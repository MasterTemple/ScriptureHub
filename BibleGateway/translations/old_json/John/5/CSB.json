[{"header":"The Third Sign: Healing the Sick"},{"num":5,"verse":"After this, a Jewish festival took place, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. "},{"num":2,"verse":"By the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there is a pool, called Bethesda in Aramaic, which has five colonnades. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Within these lay a large number of the disabled—blind, lame, and paralyzed."},{"num":5,"verse":"One man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When Jesus saw him lying there and realized he had already been there a long time, he said to him, “Do you want to get well?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"“Sir,” the disabled man answered, “I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, someone goes down ahead of me.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"“Get up,” Jesus told him, “pick up your mat and walk.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Instantly the man got well, picked up his mat, and started to walk."},{"num":10,"verse":"and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath. The law prohibits you from picking up your mat.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"He replied, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”"},{"num":12,"verse":"“Who is this man who told you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk’?” they asked. "},{"num":13,"verse":"But the man who was healed did not know who it was, because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there."},{"num":14,"verse":"After this, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you are well. Do not sin anymore, so that something worse doesn’t happen to you.” "},{"num":15,"verse":"The man went and reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Therefore, the Jews began persecuting Jesus because he was doing these things on the Sabbath."},{"header":"Honoring the Father and the Son"},{"num":17,"verse":"Jesus responded to them, “My Father is still working, and I am working also.” "},{"num":18,"verse":"This is why the Jews began trying all the more to kill him: Not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God."},{"num":19,"verse":"Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, the Son is not able to do anything on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son likewise does these things. "},{"num":20,"verse":"For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing, and he will show him greater works than these so that you will be amazed. "},{"num":21,"verse":"And just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to whom he wants. "},{"num":22,"verse":"The Father, in fact, judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son, "},{"num":23,"verse":"so that all people may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.

"},{"num":26,"verse":"For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself. "},{"num":27,"verse":"And he has granted him the right to pass judgment, because he is the Son of Man. "},{"num":28,"verse":"Do not be amazed at this, because a time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice "},{"num":29,"verse":"and come out—those who have done good things, to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked things, to the resurrection of condemnation."},{"num":30,"verse":"“I can do nothing on my own. I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me."},{"header":"Witnesses to Jesus"},{"num":31,"verse":"“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.

These very works I am doing testify about me that the Father has sent me. "},{"num":37,"verse":"The Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You have not heard his voice at any time, and you haven’t seen his form. "},{"num":38,"verse":"You don’t have his word residing in you, because you don’t believe the one he sent. "},{"num":39,"verse":"You pore over the Scriptures because you think you have eternal life in them, and yet they testify about me.

"},{"num":45,"verse":"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom you have set your hope. "},{"num":46,"verse":"For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me. "},{"num":47,"verse":"But if you don’t believe what he wrote, how will you believe my words?”"}]
