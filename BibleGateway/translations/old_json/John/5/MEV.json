[{"header":"The Healing at the Pool"},{"num":5,"verse":"After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Now in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate there is a pool, which in Hebrew is called Bethesda, having five porches. "},{"num":3,"verse":"In these lay a great crowd of invalids, blind, lame, and paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water. "},{"num":4,"verse":"For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water. After the stirring of the water, whoever stepped in first was healed of whatever disease he had. "},{"num":5,"verse":"A certain man was there who had an illness for thirty-eight years. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been in that condition now a long time, He said to him, “Do you want to be healed?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred. But while I am coming, another steps down before me.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Jesus said to him, “Rise, take up your bed and walk.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Immediately the man was healed, took up his bed, and walked."},{"num":10,"verse":"The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath day. It is not lawful for you to carry your bed.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"He answered them, “He who healed me said to me, ‘Take up your bed and walk.’ ”"},{"num":12,"verse":"So they asked him, “Who is the Man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Now the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in that place."},{"num":14,"verse":"Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, “See, you have become whole. Sin no more lest something worse happens to you.” "},{"num":15,"verse":"The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him."},{"num":16,"verse":"So the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath day. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Jesus answered them, “My Father is working still, and I am working.” "},{"num":18,"verse":"So the Jews sought even more to kill Him, because He not only had broken the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God."},{"header":"The Authority of the Son"},{"num":19,"verse":"Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do. For whatever He does, likewise the Son does. "},{"num":20,"verse":"For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself does. And He will show Him greater works than these so that you may marvel. "},{"num":21,"verse":"For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom He will. "},{"num":22,"verse":"The Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son, "},{"num":23,"verse":"that all men should honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him."},{"num":24,"verse":"“Truly, truly I say to you, whoever hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has eternal life and shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death into life. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Truly, truly I say to you, the hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. "},{"num":26,"verse":"For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself, "},{"num":27,"verse":"and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man."},{"num":28,"verse":"“Do not marvel at this. For the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice "},{"num":29,"verse":"and come out—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment. "},{"num":30,"verse":"I can do nothing of Myself. As I hear, I judge. My judgment is just, because I seek not My own will, but the will of the Father who sent Me."},{"header":"Witnesses to Jesus"},{"num":31,"verse":"“If I bear witness of Myself, My testimony is not true.

"},{"num":34,"verse":"I do not receive testimony from man, but I say these things that you may be saved. "},{"num":35,"verse":"He was a burning and a shining lamp, and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light."},{"num":36,"verse":"“I have greater testimony than that of John. The works which the Father has given Me to finish, the very works that I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me. "},{"num":37,"verse":"The Father Himself, who has sent Me, has borne witness of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.
