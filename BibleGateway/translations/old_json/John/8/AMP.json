[{"header":"The Adulterous Woman"},{"num":8,"verse":"But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Early in the morning He came back into the temple [court], and all the people were coming to Him. He sat down and began teaching them. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Now the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. They made her stand in the center of the court, "},{"num":4,"verse":"and they said to Him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women [to death]. So what do You say [to do with her—what is Your sentence]?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"They said this to test Him, hoping that they would have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and began writing on the ground with His finger. "},{"num":7,"verse":"However, when they persisted in questioning Him, He straightened up and said, “He who is without [any] sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then He stooped down again and started writing on the ground. "},{"num":9,"verse":"They listened [to His reply], and they began to go out one by one, starting with the oldest ones, until He was left alone, with the woman [standing there before Him] in the center of the court.
