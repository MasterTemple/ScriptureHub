[{"header":"The Woman Caught in Adultery"},{"num":8,"verse":"Jesus went to the Mount of Olives [east of Jerusalem across the Kidron Valley]. "},{"num":2,"verse":"But ·early in the morning [at dawn] he went back to the Temple [courts; 2:14], and all the people came to him, and he sat and taught them. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The ·teachers of the law [scribes; experts in the law of Moses] and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. They forced her to stand ·before [or in the midst of] the people. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught ·having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband [in the very act of committing adultery]. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The law of Moses commands that we stone to death every woman who does this [compare Lev. 20:10; Deut. 22:22–24]. What do you say we should do?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"They were asking this to ·trick [trap; test] Jesus so that they could have some ·charge [accusation] against him."},{"num":7,"verse":"When they continued to ask Jesus their question, he ·raised up [straightened] and said, “Anyone here who ·has never sinned [is guiltless; is without sin] can throw the first stone at her [Deut. 13:9; 17:7; comp. Lev. 24:14].” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Jesus ·bent over [stooped down] again and wrote on the ground."},{"num":9,"verse":"Those who heard Jesus began to leave one by one, first the ·older men [elders] and then the others.

The person who follows me will never ·live [walk] in darkness but will have the light ·that gives life [of life].”"},{"num":13,"verse":"The Pharisees [see 1:24] said to Jesus, “When you ·talk [testify; witness] about yourself, ·you are the only one to say these things are true. We cannot accept what you say [your testimony/witness is not true/valid; 5:31].”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Jesus answered, “Yes, I am ·saying these things [witnessing; testifying] about myself, but they are true [valid]. I know where I came from [from the Father or “from above”] and where I am going. But you don’t know where I came from or where I am going. "},{"num":15,"verse":"You judge ·by human standards [according to the flesh; rather than guided by the Spirit]. I am not judging anyone. "},{"num":16,"verse":"But ·when [if] I do judge, ·I judge truthfully [my judgment is true], because I am not alone. The Father who sent me is with me. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Your own law says that ·when two witnesses say the same thing, you must accept what they say [the testimony of two witnesses is true/valid; Deut. 17:6; 19:15].

But no one ·arrested [seized] him, because ·the right time for him [his hour; see 2:4] had not yet come."},{"header":"The People Misunderstand Jesus"},{"num":21,"verse":"Again, Jesus said to the people, “I will leave you [when he dies, is raised, and ascends to the Father], and you will ·look for [seek; search for] me, but you will die in your ·sins [sin; of unbelief]. You cannot come where I am going.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"So the Jews asked, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he said, ‘You cannot come where I am going’?”"},{"num":23,"verse":"Jesus said, “You people are from here below [from the earth], but I am from above [from heaven or from God]. You belong to this world, but I ·don’t belong to this world [am not of this world]. "},{"num":24,"verse":"So I told you that you would die in your sins. Yes, you will die in your sins if you don’t believe that ·I am he [I am; this may be an allusion to God’s (Yahweh’s) self identification either from Ex. 3:14 (the great “I AM”) or Is. 40—55, where God repeatedly says, “I am he”)].”"},{"num":25,"verse":"[Therefore] They asked, “Then who are you?”"},{"num":26,"verse":"I have many things to say and ·decide about you [or condemn/judge you for]. But I tell ·people [the world] only the things I have heard from the One who sent me, and he speaks the truth.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"The people did not understand that he was talking to them about the Father. "},{"num":28,"verse":"So Jesus said to them, “When you lift up [on the cross] the Son of Man [a title for the Messiah; Dan. 7:13–14], you will know that ·I am he [I am; see 8:24]. You will know that these things I do are not ·by my own authority [on my own] but that I say only what the Father has taught me. "},{"num":29,"verse":"The One who sent me is with me. I always do what is pleasing to him, so he has not left me alone.” "},{"num":30,"verse":"While Jesus was saying these things, many people believed in him."},{"header":"Freedom from Sin"},{"num":31,"verse":"So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him, “If you ·continue to obey my teaching [remain/abide in my word], you are truly my ·followers [disciples].

So why do you say we will be free?”"},{"num":34,"verse":"Jesus answered them, “·I tell you the truth [Truly, truly I say to you], everyone who ·lives in sin [commits/practices sin] is a slave to sin. "},{"num":35,"verse":"A slave does not ·stay with a family [live in the household] forever, but a son ·belongs to the family [lives in the household] forever.

"},{"num":37,"verse":"I know you are Abraham’s ·children [descendants; seed], but you ·want [are trying; seek] to kill me because ·you don’t accept my teaching [my word has no place in you; thus showing they were Abraham’s children only physically, not spiritually; Jer. 9:25–26; Rom. 9:7; Gal. 4:21–31].

"},{"num":44,"verse":"You ·belong to [are from] your father the devil, and you want to do what he wants. He was a murderer from the beginning [Gen. 3; Rom. 5:12] and ·was against the truth [does not uphold the truth], because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, ·he shows what he is really like [he reveals his own nature; or he speaks his own language; he speaks from his own], because he is a liar and the father of lies. "},{"num":45,"verse":"But because I speak the truth, you don’t believe me. "},{"num":46,"verse":"·Can any of you [Who among you can…?] ·prove that I am guilty [convict me] of sin?

And the prophets died, too. ·Who do you think you are [or Who are you claiming/pretending to be]?”"},{"num":54,"verse":"Jesus answered, “If I give ·honor [glory] to myself, that ·honor [glory] is worth nothing.
