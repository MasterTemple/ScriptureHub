And standing her in their midst, "},{"num":4,"verse":"they said to him, testing him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery! "},{"num":5,"verse":"Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"(Now they were saying this to test him, so that they would have an occasion to bring charges against him.) But Jesus, bending down, began to write with his finger on the ground, taking no notice. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And when they persisted in asking him, straightening up he said to them, “The one of you without sin, let him throw the first stone at her!” "},{"num":8,"verse":"And bending down again, he wrote on the ground. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Now when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, they began to depart, one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone—and the woman who was in their midst.

The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” "},{"num":13,"verse":"So the Pharisees said to him, “You testify concerning yourself! Your testimony is not true.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"But even if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.

How do you say, ‘You will become free’?” "},{"num":34,"verse":"Jesus replied to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. "},{"num":35,"verse":"And the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son remains forever. "},{"num":36,"verse":"So if the son sets you free, you will be truly free.

For I have not come from myself, but that one sent me. "},{"num":43,"verse":"Why do you not understand my way of speaking? Because you are not able to listen to my message. "},{"num":44,"verse":"You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father! That one was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand firm in the truth, because truth is not in him. Whenever he speaks the lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies. "},{"num":45,"verse":"But because I am telling the truth, you do not believe me. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Who among you convicts me concerning sin? If I am telling the truth, why do you not believe me? "},{"num":47,"verse":"The one who is from God listens to the words of God. Because of this you do not listen—because you are not of God.”"},{"num":48,"verse":"The Jews answered and said to him, “Do we not correctly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” "},{"num":49,"verse":"Jesus replied, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me!
