[{"header":"The Woman Caught in Adultery"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then everyone went home, but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Early the next morning he went back to the Temple. All the people gathered around him, and he sat down and began to teach them. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought in a woman who had been caught committing adultery, and they made her stand before them all. "},{"num":4,"verse":"“Teacher,” they said to Jesus, “this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. "},{"num":5,"verse":"In our Law Moses commanded that such a woman must be stoned to death. Now, what do you say?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"They said this to trap Jesus, so that they could accuse him. But he bent over and wrote on the ground with his finger. "},{"num":7,"verse":"As they stood there asking him questions, he straightened up and said to them, “Whichever one of you has committed no sin may throw the first stone at her.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he bent over again and wrote on the ground. "},{"num":9,"verse":"When they heard this, they all left, one by one, the older ones first. Jesus was left alone, with the woman still standing there. "},{"num":10,"verse":"He straightened up and said to her, “Where are they? Is there no one left to condemn you?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"“No one, sir,” she answered."},{"header":"Jesus the Light of the World"},{"num":12,"verse":"Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again. “I am the light of the world,” he said. “Whoever follows me will have the light of life and will never walk in darkness.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"The Pharisees said to him, “Now you are testifying on your own behalf; what you say proves nothing.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"“No,” Jesus answered, “even though I do testify on my own behalf, what I say is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. You do not know where I came from or where I am going. "},{"num":15,"verse":"You make judgments in a purely human way; I pass judgment on no one. "},{"num":16,"verse":"But if I were to do so, my judgment would be true, because I am not alone in this; the Father who sent me is with me. "},{"num":17,"verse":"It is written in your Law that when two witnesses agree, what they say is true. "},{"num":18,"verse":"I testify on my own behalf, and the Father who sent me also testifies on my behalf.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"“Where is your father?” they asked him."},{"num":20,"verse":"Jesus said all this as he taught in the Temple, in the room where the offering boxes were placed. And no one arrested him, because his hour had not come."},{"header":"You Cannot Go Where I Am Going"},{"num":21,"verse":"Again Jesus said to them, “I will go away; you will look for me, but you will die in your sins. You cannot go where I am going.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"So the Jewish authorities said, “He says that we cannot go where he is going. Does this mean that he will kill himself?”"},{"num":23,"verse":"Jesus answered, “You belong to this world here below, but I come from above. You are from this world, but I am not from this world. "},{"num":24,"verse":"That is why I told you that you will die in your sins. And you will die in your sins if you do not believe that ‘I Am Who I Am’.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"“Who are you?” they asked him."},{"num":26,"verse":"I have much to say about you, much to condemn you for. The one who sent me, however, is truthful, and I tell the world only what I have heard from him.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"They did not understand that Jesus was talking to them about the Father. "},{"num":28,"verse":"So he said to them, “When you lift up the Son of Man, you will know that ‘I Am Who I Am’; then you will know that I do nothing on my own authority, but I say only what the Father has instructed me to say. "},{"num":29,"verse":"And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I always do what pleases him.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Many who heard Jesus say these things believed in him."},{"header":"The Truth Will Set You Free"},{"num":31,"verse":"So Jesus said to those who believed in him, “If you obey my teaching, you are really my disciples; "},{"num":32,"verse":"you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”"},{"num":33,"verse":"“We are the descendants of Abraham,” they answered, “and we have never been anybody's slaves. What do you mean, then, by saying, ‘You will be free’?”"},{"num":34,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “I am telling you the truth: everyone who sins is a slave of sin. "},{"num":35,"verse":"A slave does not belong to a family permanently, but a son belongs there forever. "},{"num":36,"verse":"If the Son sets you free, then you will be really free. "},{"num":37,"verse":"I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are trying to kill me, because you will not accept my teaching. "},{"num":38,"verse":"I talk about what my Father has shown me, but you do what your father has told you.”"},{"num":39,"verse":"They answered him, “Our father is Abraham.”"},{"num":40,"verse":"All I have ever done is to tell you the truth I heard from God, yet you are trying to kill me. Abraham did nothing like this! "},{"num":41,"verse":"You are doing what your father did.”"},{"num":42,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “If God really were your Father, you would love me, because I came from God and now I am here. I did not come on my own authority, but he sent me. "},{"num":43,"verse":"Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message. "},{"num":44,"verse":"You are the children of your father, the Devil, and you want to follow your father's desires. From the very beginning he was a murderer and has never been on the side of truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he is only doing what is natural to him, because he is a liar and the father of all lies. "},{"num":45,"verse":"But I tell the truth, and that is why you do not believe me. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Which one of you can prove that I am guilty of sin? If I tell the truth, then why do you not believe me? "},{"num":47,"verse":"He who comes from God listens to God's words. You, however, are not from God, and that is why you will not listen.”"},{"header":"Jesus and Abraham"},{"num":48,"verse":"They asked Jesus, “Were we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon in you?”"},{"num":49,"verse":"“I have no demon,” Jesus answered. “I honor my Father, but you dishonor me. "},{"num":50,"verse":"I am not seeking honor for myself. But there is one who is seeking it and who judges in my favor. "},{"num":51,"verse":"I am telling you the truth: whoever obeys my teaching will never die.”"},{"num":52,"verse":"They said to him, “Now we know for sure that you have a demon! Abraham died, and the prophets died, yet you say that whoever obeys your teaching will never die. "},{"num":53,"verse":"Our father Abraham died; you do not claim to be greater than Abraham, do you? And the prophets also died. Who do you think you are?”"},{"num":54,"verse":"Jesus answered, “If I were to honor myself, that honor would be worth nothing. The one who honors me is my Father—the very one you say is your God. "},{"num":55,"verse":"You have never known him, but I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I obey his word. "},{"num":56,"verse":"Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see the time of my coming; he saw it and was glad.”"},{"num":57,"verse":"They said to him, “You are not even fifty years old—and you have seen Abraham?”"},{"num":58,"verse":"“I am telling you the truth,” Jesus replied. “Before Abraham was born, ‘I Am’.”"},{"num":59,"verse":"Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and left the Temple."}]
