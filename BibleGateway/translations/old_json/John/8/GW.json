They made her stand in front of everyone "},{"num":4,"verse":"and asked Jesus, “Teacher, we caught this woman in the act of adultery. "},{"num":5,"verse":"In his teachings, Moses ordered us to stone women like this to death. What do you say?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"They asked this to test him. They wanted to find a reason to bring charges against him."},{"num":7,"verse":"When they persisted in asking him questions, he straightened up and said, “The person who is sinless should be the first to throw a stone at her.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he bent down again and continued writing on the ground."},{"num":9,"verse":"One by one, beginning with the older men, the experts in Moses’ Teachings and Pharisees left.

He said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will have a life filled with light and will never live in the dark.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"The Pharisees said to him, “You testify on your own behalf, so your testimony isn’t true.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Jesus replied to them, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is true because I know where I came from and where I’m going. However, you don’t know where I came from or where I’m going. "},{"num":15,"verse":"You judge the way humans do. I don’t judge anyone. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Even if I do judge, my judgment is valid because I don’t make it on my own. I make my judgment with the Father who sent me.

"},{"num":44,"verse":"You come from your father, the devil, and you desire to do what your father wants you to do. The devil was a murderer from the beginning. He has never been truthful. He doesn’t know what the truth is. Whenever he tells a lie, he’s doing what comes naturally to him. He’s a liar and the father of lies. "},{"num":45,"verse":"So you don’t believe me because I tell the truth. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Can any of you convict me of committing a sin? If I’m telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?

"},{"num":51,"verse":"I can guarantee this truth: Whoever obeys what I say will never see death.”"},{"num":52,"verse":"The Jews told Jesus, “Now we know that you’re possessed by a demon. Abraham died, and so did the prophets, but you say, ‘Whoever does what I say will never taste death.’ "},{"num":53,"verse":"Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets have also died. Who do you think you are?”"},{"num":54,"verse":"Jesus said, “If I bring glory to myself, my glory is nothing. My Father is the one who gives me glory, and you say that he is your God. "},{"num":55,"verse":"Yet, you haven’t known him. However, I know him. If I would say that I didn’t know him, I would be a liar like all of you. But I do know him, and I do what he says.
