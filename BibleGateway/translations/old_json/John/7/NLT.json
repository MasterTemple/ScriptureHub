If you can do such wonderful things, show yourself to the world!”"},{"num":5,"verse":"For even his brothers didn’t believe in him."},{"num":6,"verse":"Jesus replied, “Now is not the right time for me to go, but you can go anytime."},{"num":7,"verse":"The world can’t hate you, but it does hate me because I accuse it of doing evil."},{"num":8,"verse":"You go on.
