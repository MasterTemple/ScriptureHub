"},{"num":8,"verse":"His neighbors and those who formerly had seen him as a beggar said, “Isn’t this the man who sat begging?” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Some said, “He’s the one.” “No,” others were saying, “but he looks like him.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Therefore they asked him, “Then how were your eyes opened?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So when I went and washed I received my sight.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"“Where is He?” they asked."},{"header":"The Healed Man’s Testimony"},{"num":13,"verse":"They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The day that Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath. "},{"num":15,"verse":"So again the Pharisees asked him how he received his sight."},{"num":16,"verse":"Therefore some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for He doesn’t keep the Sabbath!” But others were saying, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” And there was a division among them."},{"num":17,"verse":"Again they asked the blind man, “What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?”"},{"num":18,"verse":"The Jews did not believe this about him—that he was blind and received sight—until they summoned the parents of the one who had received his sight."},{"num":19,"verse":"They asked them, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind?

"},{"num":23,"verse":"This is why his parents said, “He’s of age; ask him.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"So a second time they summoned the man who had been blind and told him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner!”"},{"num":25,"verse":"He answered, “Whether or not He’s a sinner, I don’t know. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I can see!”"},{"num":26,"verse":"Then they asked him, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”"},{"num":27,"verse":"“I already told you,” he said, “and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t want to become His disciples too, do you?”"},{"num":28,"verse":"They ridiculed him: “You’re that man’s disciple, but we’re Moses’ disciples.
