Was it his own or his parents' sin?”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Jesus answered, “His blindness has nothing to do with his sins or his parents' sins. He is blind so that God's power might be seen at work in him. "},{"num":4,"verse":"As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me; night is coming when no one can work. "},{"num":5,"verse":"While I am in the world, I am the light for the world.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"After he said this, Jesus spat on the ground and made some mud with the spittle; he rubbed the mud on the man's eyes "},{"num":7,"verse":"and told him, “Go and wash your face in the Pool of Siloam.” (This name means “Sent.”) So the man went, washed his face, and came back seeing."},{"num":8,"verse":"His neighbors, then, and the people who had seen him begging before this, asked, “Isn't this the man who used to sit and beg?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Some said, “He is the one,” but others said, “No he isn't; he just looks like him.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"“How is it that you can now see?” they asked him."},{"num":11,"verse":"He answered, “The man called Jesus made some mud, rubbed it on my eyes, and told me to go to Siloam and wash my face.

He told them, “He put some mud on my eyes; I washed my face, and now I can see.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"Some of the Pharisees said, “The man who did this cannot be from God, for he does not obey the Sabbath law.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"So the Pharisees asked the man once more, “You say he cured you of your blindness—well, what do you say about him?”"},{"num":18,"verse":"The Jewish authorities, however, were not willing to believe that he had been blind and could now see, until they called his parents "},{"num":19,"verse":"and asked them, “Is this your son?

Why do you want to hear it again? Maybe you, too, would like to be his disciples?”"},{"num":28,"verse":"They insulted him and said, “You are that fellow's disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
