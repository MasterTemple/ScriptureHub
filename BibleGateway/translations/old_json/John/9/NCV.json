[{"header":"Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind"},{"num":9,"verse":"As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been born blind. "},{"num":2,"verse":"His followers asked him, “Teacher, whose sin caused this man to be born blind—his own sin or his parents’ sin?”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Jesus answered, “It is not this man’s sin or his parents’ sin that made him blind. This man was born blind so that God’s power could be shown in him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"After Jesus said this, he spit on the ground and made some mud with it and put the mud on the man’s eyes. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Then he told the man, “Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam.” (Siloam means Sent.) So the man went, washed, and came back seeing."},{"num":8,"verse":"The neighbors and some people who had earlier seen this man begging said, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Some said, “He is the one,” but others said, “No, he only looks like him.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"They asked, “How did you get your sight?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"He answered, “The man named Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"They asked him, “Where is this man?”"},{"header":"Pharisees Question the Healing"},{"num":13,"verse":"Then the people took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day. "},{"num":15,"verse":"So now the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you get your sight?”"},{"num":16,"verse":"So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man does not keep the Sabbath day, so he is not from God.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"They asked the man again, “What do you say about him since it was your eyes he opened?”"},{"num":18,"verse":"These leaders did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again. So they sent for the man’s parents "},{"num":19,"verse":"and asked them, “Is this your son who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”"},{"num":20,"verse":"His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. "},{"num":21,"verse":"But we don’t know how he can now see. We don’t know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.” "},{"num":22,"verse":"His parents said this because they were afraid of the elders, who had already decided that anyone who said Jesus was the Christ would be avoided. "},{"num":23,"verse":"That is why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"So for the second time, they called the man who had been blind. They said, “You should give God the glory by telling the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"He answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"They asked, “What did he do to you? How did he make you see again?”"},{"num":27,"verse":"He answered, “I already told you, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his followers, too?”"},{"num":28,"verse":"Then they insulted him and said, “You are his follower, but we are followers of Moses. "},{"num":29,"verse":"We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don’t even know where this man comes from.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"The man answered, “This is a very strange thing. You don’t know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. "},{"num":31,"verse":"We all know that God does not listen to sinners, but he listens to anyone who worships and obeys him. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Nobody has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind. "},{"num":33,"verse":"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"They answered, “You were born full of sin! Are you trying to teach us?” And they threw him out."},{"header":"Spiritual Blindness"},{"num":35,"verse":"When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, Jesus found him and said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”"},{"num":36,"verse":"He asked, “Who is the Son of Man, sir, so that I can believe in him?”"},{"num":37,"verse":"Jesus said to him, “You have seen him. The Son of Man is the one talking with you.”"},{"num":38,"verse":"He said, “Lord, I believe!” Then the man worshiped Jesus."},{"num":39,"verse":"Jesus said, “I came into this world so that the world could be judged. I came so that the blind would see and so that those who see will become blind.”"},{"num":40,"verse":"Some of the Pharisees who were nearby heard Jesus say this and asked, “Are you saying we are blind, too?”"},{"num":41,"verse":"Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But since you keep saying you see, your guilt remains.”"}]
