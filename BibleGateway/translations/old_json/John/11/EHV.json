And you are going back there again?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks around during the day, he does not stumble because he sees this world’s light. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But if anyone walks around at night, he stumbles because there is no light on him.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"He said this and then told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"Then the disciples said, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Jesus had been speaking about his death, but they thought he was merely talking about ordinary sleep.

"},{"num":30,"verse":"Now Jesus had not yet gone into the village, but was still where Martha met him. "},{"num":31,"verse":"The Jews who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw that she got up quickly and left. So they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to weep there.

Jesus told them, “Loose him and let him go.”"},{"header":"The Plot"},{"num":45,"verse":"Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in him. "},{"num":46,"verse":"But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. "},{"num":47,"verse":"So the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. They asked, “What are we going to do, because this man is doing many miraculous signs? "},{"num":48,"verse":"If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him. Then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”"},{"num":49,"verse":"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all. "},{"num":50,"verse":"You do not even consider that it is better for us that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.” "},{"num":51,"verse":"He did not say this on his own, but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation, "},{"num":52,"verse":"and not only for that nation, but also in order to gather into one the scattered children of God."},{"num":53,"verse":"So from that day on they plotted to kill him.
