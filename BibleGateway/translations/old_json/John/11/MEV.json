"},{"num":6,"verse":"So when He heard that he was sick, He remained where He was two more days. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Then after this He said to the disciples, “Let us go into Judea again.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"His disciples said to Him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone You. Are You going there again?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks during the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But if anyone walks during the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"After He said this, He said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep. But I am going that I may awaken him from sleep.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"Then His disciples said, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will be well.” "},{"num":13,"verse":"Jesus had spoken of his death.

Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. "},{"num":42,"verse":"I know that You always hear Me. But because of the people standing around, I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me.”"},{"num":43,"verse":"When He had said this, He cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” "},{"num":44,"verse":"He who was dead came out, his hands and feet wrapped with grave clothes, and his face wrapped with a cloth."},{"header":"The Plot to Kill Jesus(A)"},{"num":45,"verse":"Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what Jesus had done, believed in Him. "},{"num":46,"verse":"But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
