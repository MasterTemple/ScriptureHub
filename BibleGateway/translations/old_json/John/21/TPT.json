"},{"num":5,"verse":"He called out to them, saying, “Hey guys! Did you catch any fish?”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Jesus shouted to them, “Throw your net over the starboard side, and you’ll catch some!” And so they did as he said, and they caught so many fish they couldn’t even pull in the net!"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!” When Peter heard him say that, he quickly wrapped his outer garment around him, and because he was athletic, he dove right into the lake to go to Jesus! "},{"num":8,"verse":"The other disciples then brought the boat to shore, dragging their catch of fish. They weren’t far from land, only about a hundred meters. "},{"num":9,"verse":"And when they got to shore, they noticed a charcoal fire with some roasted fish and bread.
