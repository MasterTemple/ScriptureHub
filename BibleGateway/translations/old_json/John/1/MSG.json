[{"header":"The Life-Light"},{"num":6,"verse":"There once was a man, his name John, sent by God to point out the way to the Life-Light. He came to show everyone where to look, who to believe in. John was not himself the Light; he was there to show the way to the Light."},{"num":15,"verse":"John pointed him out and called, “This is the One! The One I told you was coming after me but in fact was ahead of me. He has always been ahead of me, has always had the first word.”"},{"header":"Thunder in the Desert"},{"num":19,"verse":"When Jews from Jerusalem sent a group of priests and officials to ask John who he was, he was completely honest. He didn’t evade the question. He told the plain truth: “I am not the Messiah.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"They pressed him, “Who, then? Elijah?”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Exasperated, they said, “Who, then? We need an answer for those who sent us. Tell us something—anything!—about yourself.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"“I’m thunder in the desert: ‘Make the road straight for God!’ I’m doing what the prophet Isaiah preached.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"Those sent to question him were from the Pharisee party. Now they had a question of their own: “If you’re neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet, why do you baptize?”"},{"num":26,"verse":"John answered, “I only baptize using water. A person you don’t recognize has taken his stand in your midst. He comes after me, but he is not in second place to me.

He forgives the sins of the world! This is the man I’ve been talking about, ‘the One who comes after me but is really ahead of me.’ I knew nothing about who he was—only this: that my task has been to get Israel ready to recognize him as the God-Revealer. That is why I came here baptizing with water, giving you a good bath and scrubbing sins from your life so you can get a fresh start with God.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"John clinched his witness with this: “I watched the Spirit, like a dove flying down out of the sky, making himself at home in him. I repeat, I know nothing about him except this: The One who authorized me to baptize with water told me, ‘The One on whom you see the Spirit come down and stay, this One will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ That’s exactly what I saw happen, and I’m telling you, there’s no question about it: This is the Son of God.”"},{"header":"Come, See for Yourself"},{"num":35,"verse":"The next day John was back at his post with two disciples, who were watching. He looked up, saw Jesus walking nearby, and said, “Here he is, God’s Passover Lamb.”"},{"num":37,"verse":"The two disciples heard him and went after Jesus. Jesus looked over his shoulder and said to them, “What are you after?”"},{"num":39,"verse":"He replied, “Come along and see for yourself.”"},{"num":40,"verse":"Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John’s witness and followed Jesus.

You’ve got to be kidding.”"},{"num":47,"verse":"When Jesus saw him coming he said, “There’s a real Israelite, not a false bone in his body.”"},{"num":48,"verse":"Nathanael said, “Where did you get that idea? You don’t know me.”"},{"num":49,"verse":"Nathanael exclaimed, “Rabbi! You are the Son of God, the King of Israel!”"},{"num":50,"verse":"Jesus said, “You’ve become a believer simply because I say I saw you one day sitting under the fig tree?
