Carrying harps of God, triumphant over the Beast, its image, and the number of its name, the saved ones stood on the sea of glass.

The Seven Angels carrying the seven disasters came out of the Temple. They were dressed in clean, bright linen and wore gold vests. One of the Four Animals handed the Seven Angels seven gold bowls, brimming with the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. Smoke from God’s glory and power poured out of the Temple.
