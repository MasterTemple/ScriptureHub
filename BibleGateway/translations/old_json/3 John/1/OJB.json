It is possible that the first book of the Brit Chadasha was written by Ya’akov [see p.848], possibly around 45 C.E. However, the iggeret hakodesh on this page is written by Moshiach’s Shliach Yochanan to Gaius with the prayer that as Gaius prospers spiritually, he will succeed in every aspect of his life. It appears that the Shliach Yochanan had led Gaius to faith in the Moshiach (see verse 3-4) and Gaius in turn had shown kindness and hachnosas orchim (hospitality) to certain of Moshiach’s traveling emissaries, who had reported Gaius’ generosity (verse 6) before the Kehillah where the Shliach Yochanan is now, probably the same kehillah in Asia Minor where Yochanan did much of his other writing: his Besurah Geulah, his other iggrot kodesh, and his Hisgalus. The purpose of the letter is to commend an itinerant emissary of Moshiach named Demetrius (verse 12). When planting a new Messianic Shul, the non-believers are not to be asked for financial support (verse 7). Therefore, the Messianic kehillot and their Zekenim are to offer hachnosas orchim and material help to travelling emissaries of Moshiach such as Demetrius. Also this epistle teaches that when one knows G-d, the Truth gives an inner eidus or testimony (verse 12). Other Scripture on this matter of assurance are found in Ro 8:15-17, 38f; Ga 4:6; Pp 1:6; 2Ti 1:12; Yn 5:24; 1Yn 5:13; 1Yn 4:13; 5:10; 3:18- 19; MJ 6:11; 10:22. As we study the Holy Bible we find that we can discover there (not in emotional experience or in our circumstances) that we are heirs of salvation and children with a heavenly calling, citizenship, and destiny. See also 2Ti 3:14; Col 2:2; 1Th 1:5; Ro 14:5; 4:21; 1Th 2:13; Ac 2:38, 5:32; Ga 3:2; Ac 15:8; 1Yn 3:24; Eph 1:13-14; 4:30. There are other Scriptures that warn against self-deception in these matters, and give moral and spiritual tests so that anyone can see if he or she is walking in the light—see 1Yn 2:3-5; 3:9f; 14, 18f, 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18; 1 Yn 3:19; 1 Yn 1:6; 2:4, 9- 11, 23: 3:6-10, 4:8,20; 2Yn 9; 3Yn 11."}]
