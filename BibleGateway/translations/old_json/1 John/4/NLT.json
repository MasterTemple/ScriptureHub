Such a person has the spirit of the Antichrist, which you heard is coming into the world and indeed is already here."},{"num":4,"verse":"But you belong to God, my dear children. You have already won a victory over those people, because the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world."},{"num":5,"verse":"Those people belong to this world, so they speak from the world’s viewpoint, and the world listens to them."},{"num":6,"verse":"But we belong to God, and those who know God listen to us.
