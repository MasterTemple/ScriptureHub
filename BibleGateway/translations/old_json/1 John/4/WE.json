There are many prophets who are not true who have gone out into the world."},{"num":2,"verse":"Here is how you can know the Spirit of God. Every spirit that believes that Jesus Christ has come in the body of a man is from God."},{"num":3,"verse":"And every spirit that does not say this about Jesus, does not belong to God. That is the spirit of the one who is against Christ. You have heard that he is coming. And now he is already in the world."},{"num":4,"verse":"My children, you belong to God. You have won the victory over those prophets who are not true. You have won because the Spirit that is in you is stronger than the spirit that is in the world."},{"num":5,"verse":"Those prophets belong to the world. That is why they teach about things in the world. And that is why the people of the world listen to them."},{"num":6,"verse":"But we belong to God. Anyone who knows God listens to us. Anyone who does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know if a spirit is true or not true."},{"num":7,"verse":"My dear brothers, we must love one another, because love comes from God.
