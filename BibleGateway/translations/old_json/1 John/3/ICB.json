We have not yet been shown what we will be in the future. But we know that when Christ comes again, we will be like him. We will see him as he really is. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Christ is pure. And every person who has this hope in Christ keeps himself pure like Christ."},{"num":4,"verse":"When a person sins, he breaks God’s law. Yes, sinning is the same as living against God’s law. "},{"num":5,"verse":"You know that Christ came to take away sins. There is no sin in Christ. "},{"num":6,"verse":"So the person who lives in Christ does not go on sinning. If he goes on sinning, he has never really understood Christ and has never known him."},{"num":7,"verse":"Dear children, do not let any person lead you the wrong way. Christ is righteous. To be like Christ, a person must do what is right. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The devil has been sinning since the beginning. Anyone who continues to sin belongs to the devil.
