And he is the way all people can have their sins taken away too."},{"num":3,"verse":"If we obey what God has told us to do, then we are sure that we know him."},{"num":4,"verse":"If we say we know God but do not obey his commands, we are lying.

It is the same command you have had since the beginning. This command is the teaching you have already heard."},{"num":8,"verse":"But what I write is also a new command.
