But let all the other people of Israel, your relatives, cry for those the Lord destroyed with fire."},{"num":7,"verse":"But you must not even leave the entrance of the Meeting Tent.

They must also bring the thigh of the fellowship offering and the breast that is lifted up to show it is offered in front of the Lord. Then it will be your share of the offering.
