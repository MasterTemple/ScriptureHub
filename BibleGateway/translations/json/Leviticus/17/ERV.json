You might be in the camp or outside the camp."},{"num":4,"verse":"It doesn’t matter; you must bring that animal to the entrance of the Meeting Tent. You must give a part of that animal as a gift to the Lord. You spilled blood, so you must take a gift to the Lord’s Holy Tent. If you don’t take part of the animal as a gift to the Lord, you must be separated from your people!"},{"num":5,"verse":"This rule is so that you will bring your fellowship offering to the Lord. You must bring any animal that you kill in the field to the Lord at the entrance of the Meeting Tent. Bring those animals to the priest."},{"num":6,"verse":"Then the priest will throw their blood onto the Lord’s altar near the entrance of the Meeting Tent.

Whoever eats blood must be separated from their people."},{"num":15,"verse":"“If any of you, whether Israelite or foreigner living among you, eats an animal that died by itself or was killed by some other animal, you will be unclean until evening.
