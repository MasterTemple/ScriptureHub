It could be his mother, father, son, daughter or brother. "},{"num":3,"verse":"He can also go near a sister who is not married. She would have depended on him because she did not have a husband. The priest can make himself “unclean” by going near her body. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But he must not make himself “unclean” by going near the bodies of people only related to him by marriage. Going near them would make him “unclean.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"“ ‘Priests must not shave any part of their heads. They must not shave off the edges of their beards. They must not make cuts on their bodies when someone dies. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Priests must be holy. They must be set apart for me. I am their God. They must not treat my name as if it were not holy. They must be holy because they bring food offerings to me. That is my food."},{"num":7,"verse":"“ ‘They must not get married to women who are “unclean” because they are prostitutes. They must not marry women who are divorced from their husbands.
