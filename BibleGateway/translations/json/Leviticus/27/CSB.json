"},{"num":8,"verse":"But if one is too poor to pay the assessment, he is to present the person before the priest and the priest will set a value for him. The priest will set a value for him according to what the one making the vow can afford."},{"num":9,"verse":"“If the vow involves one of the animals that may be brought as an offering to the Lord, any of these he gives to the Lord will be holy.
