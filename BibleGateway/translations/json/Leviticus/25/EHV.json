"},{"num":50,"verse":"Together with his buyer, he shall calculate the elapsed time from the year that he was sold until the year of Jubilee, and the price to redeem him shall be based on that number of years. It shall be calculated as if he were a hired laborer. "},{"num":51,"verse":"If there are still many years left, he shall pay the price of redemption proportionally to the years that have passed. "},{"num":52,"verse":"If only a few years remain until the year of Jubilee, he shall calculate the redemption in this way: He shall pay the price of his redemption on the basis of his years of work, "},{"num":53,"verse":"as if he were a worker hired year by year.
