[{"num":1,"verse":"The burden or oracle (the thing to be lifted up) which Habakkuk the prophet saw."},{"num":2,"verse":"O Lord, how long shall I cry for help and You will not hear? Or cry out to You of violence and You will not save?"},{"num":3,"verse":"Why do You show me iniquity and wrong, and Yourself look upon or cause me to see perverseness and trouble? For destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention arises."},{"num":4,"verse":"Therefore the law is slackened and justice and a righteous sentence never go forth, for the [hostility of the] wicked surrounds the [uncompromisingly] righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted."},{"num":5,"verse":"Look around [you, Habakkuk, replied the Lord] among the nations and see! And be astonished! Astounded! For I am putting into effect a work in your days [such] that you would not believe it if it were told you."},{"num":6,"verse":"For behold, I am rousing up the Chaldeans, that bitter and impetuous nation who march through the breadth of the earth to take possession of dwelling places that do not belong to them."},{"num":7,"verse":"[The Chaldeans] are terrible and dreadful; their justice and dignity proceed [only] from themselves."},{"num":8,"verse":"Their horses also are swifter than leopards and are fiercer than the evening wolves, and their horsemen spread themselves and press on proudly; yes, their horsemen come from afar; they fly like an eagle that hastens to devour."},{"num":9,"verse":"They all come for violence; their faces turn eagerly forward, and they gather prisoners together like sand."},{"num":10,"verse":"They scoff at kings, and rulers are a derision to them; they ridicule every stronghold, for they heap up dust [for earth mounds] and take it."},{"num":11,"verse":"Then they sweep by like a wind and pass on, and they load themselves with guilt, [as do all men] whose own power is their god."},{"num":12,"verse":"Are not You from everlasting, O Lord my God, my Holy One?
