[{"num":5,"verse":"And now, a word to you elders of the church. I, too, am an elder; with my own eyes I saw Christ dying on the cross; and I, too, will share his glory and his honor when he returns. Fellow elders, this is my plea to you: "},{"num":2,"verse":"Feed the flock of God; care for it willingly, not grudgingly; not for what you will get out of it but because you are eager to serve the Lord. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Don’t be tyrants, but lead them by your good example, "},{"num":4,"verse":"and when the Head Shepherd comes, your reward will be a never-ending share in his glory and honor."},{"num":5,"verse":"You younger men, follow the leadership of those who are older.

Amen."},{"num":12,"verse":"I am sending this note to you through the courtesy of Silvanus who is, in my opinion, a very faithful brother.
