You do not ask for burnt offerings and offerings to take away sins.” (These are all sacrifices that the law commands.) "},{"num":9,"verse":"Then he said, “Here I am. I have come to do what you want.” So God ends the first system of sacrifices so that he can set up the new system. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Jesus Christ did what God wanted him to do. And because of this, we are made holy through the sacrifice of his body. Christ made this sacrifice only once, and for all time."},{"num":11,"verse":"Every day the priests stand and do their religious service. Again and again they offer the same sacrifices. But those sacrifices can never take away sins. "},{"num":12,"verse":"But Christ offered one sacrifice for sins, and it is good forever. Then he sat down at the right side of God. "},{"num":13,"verse":"And now Christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power.

Do this even more as you see the Day coming."},{"num":26,"verse":"If we decide to go on sinning after we have learned the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins.

He looks at the blood of the agreement, the blood that made him holy, as no different from other men’s blood. He insults the Spirit of God’s grace. Surely he should have a much worse punishment.
