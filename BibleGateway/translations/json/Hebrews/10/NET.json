"},{"num":2,"verse":"For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have no further consciousness of sin?

"},{"num":10,"verse":"By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. "},{"num":11,"verse":"And every priest stands day after day serving and offering the same sacrifices again and again—sacrifices that can never take away sins. "},{"num":12,"verse":"But when this priest had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, he sat down at the right hand of God, "},{"num":13,"verse":"where he is now waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy. "},{"num":15,"verse":"And the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us, for after saying, "},{"num":16,"verse":"“This is the covenant that I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord.

"},{"num":23,"verse":"And let us hold unwaveringly to the hope that we confess, for the one who made the promise is trustworthy. "},{"num":24,"verse":"And let us take thought of how to spur one another on to love and good works, "},{"num":25,"verse":"not abandoning our own meetings, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and even more so because you see the day drawing near."},{"num":26,"verse":"For if we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins is left for us, "},{"num":27,"verse":"but only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume God’s enemies.
