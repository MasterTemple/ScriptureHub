"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"In it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which there were a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot speak now in detail."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Such preparations having been made, the priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties; "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"but only the high priest goes into the second, and he but once a year, and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed unintentionally by the people. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"This is a symbol of the present time, during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms, regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.
