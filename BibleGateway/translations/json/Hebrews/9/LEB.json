[{"header":"The Earthly Ministry of the Old Covenant"},{"num":9,"verse":"Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and the earthly sanctuary.

"},{"num":3,"verse":"And after the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies, "},{"num":4,"verse":"containing the golden incense altar and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which were a golden jar containing the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, about which it is not now possible to speak in detail."},{"num":6,"verse":"Now these things having been prepared in this way, the priests enter into the first tent continually as they accomplish their service, "},{"num":7,"verse":"but only the high priest enters into the second tent once a year, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and the sins of the people committed in ignorance. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The Holy Spirit was making this clear, that the way into the holy place was not yet revealed, while the first tent was still in existence, "},{"num":9,"verse":"which was a symbol for the present time, in which both the gifts and sacrifices which were offered were not able to perfect the worshiper with respect to the conscience, "},{"num":10,"verse":"concerning instead only food and drink and different washings, regulations of outward things imposed until the time of setting things right."},{"header":"The Heavenly Ministry of the New Covenant"},{"num":11,"verse":"But Christ has arrived as a high priest of the good things to come. Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation, "},{"num":12,"verse":"and not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the most holy place, obtaining eternal redemption. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify them for the ritual purity of the flesh, "},{"num":14,"verse":"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God?"},{"num":15,"verse":"And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions committed during the first covenant, those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
