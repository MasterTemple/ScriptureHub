[{"header":"Old Covenant Ministry"},{"num":9,"verse":"Now the first covenant also had regulations for ministry and an earthly sanctuary.

"},{"num":4,"verse":"It contained the gold altar of incense and the ark of the covenant, covered with gold on all sides, in which there was a gold jar containing the manna, Aaron’s staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.

It is not possible to speak about these things in detail right now."},{"num":6,"verse":"With these things set up this way, the priests enter the first room repeatedly, performing their ministry. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But the high priest alone enters the second room, and he does that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The Holy Spirit was making it clear that the way into the most holy place had not yet been disclosed while the first tabernacle was still standing.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow, sprinkling those who are defiled, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, "},{"num":14,"verse":"how much more will the blood of the Messiah, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God?"},{"num":15,"verse":"Therefore, He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.
