"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Behind the second veil there was another tabernacle [the inner one or second section] known as the Holy of Holies, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold. This contained a golden jar which held the manna, and the rod of Aaron that sprouted, and the [two stone] tablets of the covenant [inscribed with the Ten Commandments]; "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"and above the ark were the [golden] cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but we cannot now go into detail about these things."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Now when these things have been prepared in this way, the priests continually enter the outer [or first section of the] tabernacle [that is, the Holy Place] performing [their ritual acts of] the divine worship, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"but into the second [inner tabernacle, the Holy of Holies], only the high priest  [and then only] once a year, and never without [bringing a sacrifice of] blood, which he offers [as a substitutionary atonement] for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"By this the Holy Spirit signifies that the way into the Holy Place [the true Holy of Holies and the presence of God] has not yet been disclosed as long as the first  outer tabernacle is still standing [that is, as long as the Levitical system of worship remains a recognized institution], "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"for this [first or outer tabernacle] is a symbol [that is, an archetype or paradigm] for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which are incapable of perfecting the conscience  renewing the [inner self of the] worshiper. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For they [the gifts, sacrifices, and ceremonies] deal only with [clean and unclean] food and drink and various ritual washings, [mere] external regulations for the body imposed [to help the worshipers] until the time of reformation [that is, the time of the new order when Christ will establish the reality of what these things foreshadow—a better covenant]."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But when Christ appeared as a High Priest of the good things to come [that is, true spiritual worship],  through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not a part of this [material] creation. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He went once for all into the Holy Place [the Holy of Holies of heaven, into the presence of God], and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, having obtained  secured eternal redemption [that is, the salvation of all who personally believe in Him as Savior]. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For if the sprinkling of [ceremonially] defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a [burnt] heifer is sufficient for the cleansing of the body, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal [Holy] Spirit  offered Himself unblemished [that is, without moral or spiritual imperfection as a sacrifice] to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works  lifeless observances to serve the ever living God?"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For this reason He is the Mediator  Negotiator of a new covenant [that is, an entirely new agreement uniting God and man], so that those who have been called [by God] may receive [the fulfillment of] the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has taken place [as the payment] which redeems them from the sins  under the  first covenant.
