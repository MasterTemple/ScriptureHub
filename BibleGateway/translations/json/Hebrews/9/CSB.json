[{"header":"Old Covenant Ministry"},{"num":9,"verse":"Now the first covenant also had regulations for ministry and an earthly sanctuary.

In the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands (that is, not of this creation), "},{"num":12,"verse":"he entered the most holy place once for all time, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow, sprinkling those who are defiled, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, "},{"num":14,"verse":"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we can serve the living God?"},{"num":15,"verse":"Therefore, he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.
