"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold. In this ark were the golden urn containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And above the ark were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Now is not the time to speak of these things in detail. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So with these things prepared like this, the priests enter continually into the outer tent as they perform their duties. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But only the high priest enters once a year into the inner tent, and not without blood that he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The Holy Spirit is making clear that the way into the Holy Place had not yet appeared as long as the old tabernacle was standing. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"This was a symbol for the time then present, when gifts and sacrifices were offered that could not perfect the conscience of the worshiper. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"They served only for matters of food and drink and various ritual washings; they are external regulations imposed until the new order came."},{"type":"header","content":"Christ’s Service in the Heavenly Sanctuary"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things to come. He passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"and he entered once for all into the Most Holy Place not by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood, and so he himself secured eternal redemption. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled consecrated them and provided ritual purity, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our consciences from dead works to worship the living God."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And so he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance he has promised, since he died to set them free from the violations committed under the first covenant.
