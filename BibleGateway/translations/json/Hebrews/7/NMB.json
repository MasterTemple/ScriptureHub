[{"num":7,"verse":"This Melchizedek, king of Salem (who, being priest of the most high God, met Abraham as he returned from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, "},{"num":2,"verse":"to whom also Abraham gave tithes of all the spoils) is by translation of his name, king of righteousness. After that, he is king of Salem; that is to say, king of peace. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Without father, without mother, without kin, and having neither a beginning of his days nor yet end of his life, he is likened to the Son of God and continues a priest forever."},{"num":4,"verse":"Consider what a man this was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave tithes of the spoils. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And now, those children of Levi that received the office of the priests have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law; that is to say from their brethren, yea though they came out of the loins of Abraham. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But he whose kindred is not counted among them received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And without argument, he who is less receives blessing from him who is greater. "},{"num":8,"verse":"And here, men who die receive tithes. But there, he receives tithes of whom it is witnessed that he lives. "},{"num":9,"verse":"And to say the truth, Levi himself also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham. "},{"num":10,"verse":"For he was yet in the loins of his father Abraham when Melchizedek met him."},{"num":11,"verse":"If now therefore perfection came by the priesthood of the Levites (for under that priesthood the people received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not after the order of Aaron? "},{"num":12,"verse":"Now no doubt if the priesthood is translated, then of necessity the law must be translated also. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For he of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, of which no man ever served at the altar. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For it is evident that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, of which tribe Moses said nothing concerning priesthood."},{"num":15,"verse":"And it is yet a more evident thing if another priest in the similitude of Melchizedek arises, "},{"num":16,"verse":"who is not made priest by the law of the carnal commandment, but by the power of the endless life.
