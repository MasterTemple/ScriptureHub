[{"num":12,"verse":"Since we have such a huge crowd of men of faith watching us from the grandstands, let us strip off anything that slows us down or holds us back, and especially those sins that wrap themselves so tightly around our feet and trip us up; and let us run with patience the particular race that God has set before us."},{"num":2,"verse":"Keep your eyes on Jesus, our leader and instructor. He was willing to die a shameful death on the cross because of the joy he knew would be his afterwards; and now he sits in the place of honor by the throne of God."},{"num":3,"verse":"If you want to keep from becoming fainthearted and weary, think about his patience as sinful men did such terrible things to him.

"},{"num":6,"verse":"For when he punishes you, it proves that he loves you. When he whips you, it proves you are really his child.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Let God train you, for he is doing what any loving father does for his children. Whoever heard of a son who was never corrected?

So remember, and be careful."},{"num":18,"verse":"You have not had to stand face to face with terror, flaming fire, gloom, darkness, and a terrible storm as the Israelites did at Mount Sinai when God gave them his laws.
