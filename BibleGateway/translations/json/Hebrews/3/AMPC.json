[{"num":3,"verse":"So then, brethren, consecrated and set apart for God, who share in the heavenly calling, [thoughtfully and attentively] consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest Whom we confessed [as ours when we embraced the Christian faith]."},{"num":2,"verse":"[See how] faithful He was to Him Who appointed Him [Apostle and High Priest], as Moses was also faithful in the whole house [of God]."},{"num":3,"verse":"Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater honor and glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house [itself]."},{"num":4,"verse":"For [of course] every house is built and furnished by someone, but the Builder of all things and the Furnisher [of the entire equipment of all things] is God."},{"num":5,"verse":"And Moses certainly was faithful in the administration of all God’s house [but it was only] as a ministering servant.
