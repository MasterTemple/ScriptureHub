[{"num":27,"verse":"¶ And David said in his heart, In the end I shall be killed some day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than that I should escape once and for all into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more within the borders of Israel; so shall I escape out of his hand."},{"num":2,"verse":"And David arose, and he went over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath."},{"num":3,"verse":"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each one with his household, David with his two wives, Ahinoam, the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, who had been the wife of Nabal of Carmel."},{"num":4,"verse":"And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, and he sought him no more."},{"num":5,"verse":"And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let me be given a place in one of the cities of the land that I may dwell there, for why should thy slave dwell in the royal city with thee?"},{"num":6,"verse":"Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day.
