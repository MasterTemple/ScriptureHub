I have ·been your leader [walked before/in front of you] since I was young [until this day]. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Here I am. ·If I have done anything wrong, you must testify [Bear witness] against me before the Lord and his ·appointed king [anointed]. Did I steal anyone’s ox or donkey? Did I ·hurt [oppress] or cheat anyone? Did I ever secretly accept a bribe to ·look the other way [close my eyes]? If I did any of these things, I will make ·it right [amends].”"},{"num":4,"verse":"The Israelites answered, “You have not cheated us, or ·hurt [oppressed] us, or taken anything ·unfairly from anyone [from anyone’s hand].”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Samuel said to them, “The Lord is a witness ·to what you have said [against you].

So he ·handed them over as slaves [sold them] to Sisera [Judg. 4–5], the commander of the army of Hazor, and ·as slaves to [into the hand of] the Philistines [Judg. 13–16] and the king of Moab. ·They all […all of whom had] fought against your ·ancestors [fathers]. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then your ancestors cried to the Lord and said, ‘We have sinned. We have ·left [turned away from; forsaken] the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths [gods and goddesses of the Canaanites].

If you do, it will be well with you. "},{"num":15,"verse":"But if you don’t ·obey [listen to the voice of] the Lord, and if you ·turn [rebel] against ·his commands [the mouth of the Lord], ·he [the hand of the Lord] will be ·against [heavy on] you. ·He will do to you what he did to […as it was on] your ·ancestors [fathers]."},{"num":16,"verse":"“Now stand ·still [where you are] and see the ·great thing [wonder; thing] the Lord will do before your eyes. "},{"num":17,"verse":"·It is [Is it not…?] now the time of the wheat harvest [the dry season]. I will pray for the Lord to send thunder and rain [the rain would destroy the wheat harvest]. Then you will know what an ·evil [wicked] thing you did ·against [in the eyes/sight of] the Lord when you ·asked for [demanded] a king.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Then Samuel ·prayed [called] to the Lord, and that same day the Lord sent thunder and rain. So the people were ·very afraid [in awe] of the Lord and Samuel. "},{"num":19,"verse":"·They [All the people] said to Samuel, “Pray to the Lord your God for us, your servants! Don’t let us die!
