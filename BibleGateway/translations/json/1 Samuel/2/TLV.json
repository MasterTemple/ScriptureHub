Whatever the fork brought up, the kohen would take for himself. This is how they dealt with all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.

But you must give it now—otherwise, I will take it by force.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"Thus the sin of the young men was very great before Adonai, for the men despised the offering of Adonai."},{"num":18,"verse":"But Samuel was ministering before Adonai, as a boy girded with a linen ephod.
