Whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is how it was done for all the Israelites who came to Shiloh."},{"num":15,"verse":"But with Eli’s sons, even before the fat was burned, the priest’s assistant would come and say to the person offering the sacrifice, “Give the priest some meat to roast. He won’t accept boiled meat from you.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"If anyone said, “Let the fat be burned off first, as usual, then take whatever you like for yourself,” the assistant would reply, “No, hand it over now.
