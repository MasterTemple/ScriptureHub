"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the men of David said to him, “This is the day of which the Lord said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it seems good to you.’ ” And David arose and secretly cut off a corner of Saul’s robe. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Now it happened afterward that David’s heart troubled him because he had cut Saul’s robe. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And he said to his men, “The Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the Lord’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"So David restrained his servants with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul.
