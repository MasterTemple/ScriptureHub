Am I not the Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose for yourselves a man so he may come down to me! "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If he is able to fight with me and strike me down, we will become your servants. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, you will become our servants and will serve us.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then the Philistine said, “I defy Israel’s troops this day! Give me a man so we can fight each other!” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When Saul and all the Israelites heard these words of the Philistine, they were upset and very afraid."}],[{"type":"prose","content":" Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse from Bethlehem in Judah.

For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he defies the armies of the living God?” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The soldiers told him what had been promised, saying, “This is what will be done for the man who can strike him down.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When David’s oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking to the men, he became angry with David and said, “Why have you come down here? To whom did you entrust those few sheep in the wilderness? I am familiar with your pride and deceit! You have come down here to watch the battle.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"David replied, “What have I done now? Can’t I say anything?” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then he turned from those who were nearby to someone else and asked the same question, but they gave him the same answer as before. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When David’s words were overheard and reported to Saul, he called for him."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"David said to Saul, “Don’t let anyone be discouraged. Your servant will go and fight this Philistine!” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But Saul replied to David, “You aren’t able to go against this Philistine and fight him. You’re just a boy!

Whenever a lion or bear would come and carry off a sheep from the flock, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"I would go out after it, strike it down, and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose up against me, I would grab it by its jaw, strike it, and kill it. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be just like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"David went on to say, “The  who delivered me from the lion and the bear will also deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” Then Saul said to David, “Go!

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire and tried to walk around, but he was not used to them. David said to Saul, “I can’t walk in these things, for I’m not used to them.” So David removed them.
