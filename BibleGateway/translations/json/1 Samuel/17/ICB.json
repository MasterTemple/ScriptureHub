They said, “This is what will be done for the man who kills Goliath.”"},{"num":28,"verse":"David’s oldest brother Eliab heard David talking with the soldiers. He became angry with David. He asked David, “Why did you come here? Who’s taking care of those few sheep of yours in the desert? I know you are proud. Your attitude is very bad. You came down here just to watch the battle!”"},{"num":29,"verse":"David asked, “Now what have I done wrong? Can’t I even talk?” "},{"num":30,"verse":"He then turned to other people and asked the same questions. And they gave him the same answer as before.

I, your servant, will go and fight this Philistine!”"},{"num":33,"verse":"Saul answered, “You can’t go out against this Philistine and fight him. You’re only a boy. Goliath has been a warrior since he was a young man.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"But David said to Saul, “I, your servant, have been keeping my father’s sheep. When a lion or bear came and took a sheep from the flock, "},{"num":35,"verse":"I would chase it. I would attack it and save the sheep from its mouth. When it attacked me, I caught it by its fur.

But I come to you in the name of the Lord of heaven’s armies. He’s the God of the armies of Israel! You have spoken out against him. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Today the Lord will give you to me. I’ll kill you, and I’ll cut off your head. Today I’ll feed the bodies of the Philistine soldiers to the birds of the air and the wild animals. Then all the world will know there is a God in Israel! "},{"num":47,"verse":"Everyone gathered here will know the Lord does not need swords or spears to save people. The battle belongs to him!
