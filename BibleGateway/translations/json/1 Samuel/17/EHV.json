He was named Goliath of Gath. He was nine feet, six inches tall. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he wore scaled body armor, which was made of more than one hundred pounds of bronze. "},{"num":6,"verse":"He had bronze greaves on his shins and a bronze spear slung between his shoulders. "},{"num":7,"verse":"The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his spearhead was made of fifteen pounds of iron. His shield bearer went out ahead of him."},{"num":8,"verse":"He would stand up and shout to the armies of Israel, “Why have you come out to line up in battle formation? I am a Philistine, and you are servants of Saul, aren’t you? Choose a man to represent you, and let him come down to me.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"An Israelite had said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? He keeps coming up to taunt Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who kills him. He will give his daughter to him in marriage and make his father’s house exempt from taxes in Israel.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"David spoke to the men who stood near him.

Who is this uncircumcised Philistine who dares to defy the troops of the living God?”"},{"num":27,"verse":"The people again told him what would be done for the man who killed Goliath."},{"num":28,"verse":"When Eliab, David’s oldest brother, heard David speaking to the men, he burned with anger against David. He said, “Why have you come down? Who is taking care of those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the mischief in your heart. You have come down just to see the battle.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"David said, “What have I done now? Can’t I say anything?” "},{"num":30,"verse":"So David turned away from him toward another person, and he asked the same thing again, and the soldiers again answered him the same way. "},{"num":31,"verse":"When they heard what David said, they reported it to Saul, and he sent for David. "},{"num":32,"verse":"David said to Saul, “Do not let anyone lose heart because of this Philistine! Your servant will go and fight him.”"},{"num":33,"verse":"But Saul said to David, “You cannot go against this Philistine to fight with him, because you are just a boy, and he has been a warrior since he was a youth.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"David said to Saul, “Your servant has been taking care of his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock, "},{"num":35,"verse":"I went after it and struck it and rescued the lamb out of its mouth. When the lion reared up against me, I grabbed it by its mane, struck it, and killed it. "},{"num":36,"verse":"Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has defied the ranks of the living God.” "},{"num":37,"verse":"David added, “The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.”"},{"num":38,"verse":"So Saul dressed David in his own gear. He placed a bronze helmet on his head and dressed him in scaled body armor. "},{"num":39,"verse":"David strapped his sword over his gear. David tried to walk around in them, since he had never trained with this kind of equipment before."},{"num":40,"verse":"Then David took his staff in his hand and picked five smooth stones out of the stream bed and put them into the pouch of his shepherd’s bag. He took his sling in his hand and approached the Philistine."},{"num":41,"verse":"The Philistine kept walking and got closer and closer to David. The man who was carrying his shield was walking ahead of him. "},{"num":42,"verse":"When the Philistine got a good look at David, he despised him, because David was just a boy, nothing but a good-looking, red-headed boy."},{"num":43,"verse":"The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come against me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods. "},{"num":44,"verse":"The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will feed your flesh to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the countryside.”"},{"num":45,"verse":"Then David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord of Armies, the God of the ranks of Israel, whom you have defied.

The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown to the ground."},{"num":50,"verse":"So David defeated the Philistine with a sling and a stone. He struck the Philistine and killed him, even though David did not have a sword in his hand. "},{"num":51,"verse":"So David ran, stood over the Philistine, took hold of his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it."},{"num":52,"verse":"The men of Israel and Judah got up, cheering loudly, and pursued the Philistines toward the entrance of the valley, all the way to the gates of Ekron. Fatally-wounded Philistines lined the road from Sha’araim all the way to Gath and Ekron. "},{"num":53,"verse":"When the Israelites returned from pursuing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.
