They also went through the territory of the descendants of Benjamin, but they did not find them."},{"num":5,"verse":"When they entered the region of Zuph, Saul told the young man with him, “Come on, let’s go back so my father does not stop worrying about the donkeys and become anxious about us.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"The young man said, “Look, there’s a man of God in this town. The man is respected, and everything he predicts happens. Now, let’s go there. Perhaps he can tell us about the journey on which we have set out.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Saul told the young man, “Look, we could go, but what could we bring the man?

I have in my hand a quarter shekel of silver. I’ll give it to the man of God, and he will tell us about our journey.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"(Previously in Israel, a person would say when he went to inquire of God, “Come on!
