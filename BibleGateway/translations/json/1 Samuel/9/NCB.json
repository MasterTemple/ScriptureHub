He next passed into the land of the Benjaminites, but they did not find them."},{"num":5,"verse":"When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, “Come on, let us go back, lest my father stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"But the servant replied, “There is a man of God in this town. He is highly respected, and everything that he says comes true. Let us now go to him, perhaps he can tell us where to go.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Saul said to his servant, “If we go, what are we going to bring the man? We have used up all of the food in our sacks.
