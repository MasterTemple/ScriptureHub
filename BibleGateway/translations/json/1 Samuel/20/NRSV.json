What is my guilt? And what is my sin against your father that he is trying to take my life?” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. My father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me; and why should my father hide this from me? Never!” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But David also swore, “Your father knows well that you like me; and he thinks, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be grieved.’ But truly, as the  lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"David said to Jonathan, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at the meal; but let me go, so that I may hide in the field until the third evening. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’ "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If he says, ‘Good!’ it will be well with your servant; but if he is angry, then know that evil has been determined by him.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"On the day after tomorrow, you shall go a long way down; go to the place where you hid yourself earlier, and remain beside the stone there. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you, collect them,’ then you are to come, for, as the  lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But if I say to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go; for the  has sent you away.

When the new moon came, the king sat at the feast to eat. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The king sat upon his seat, as at other times, upon the seat by the wall. Jonathan stood, while Abner sat by Saul’s side; but David’s place was empty."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Saul did not say anything that day; for he thought, “Something has befallen him; he is not clean, surely he is not clean.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But on the second day, the day after the new moon, David’s place was empty.

So now, if I have found favor in your sight, let me get away, and see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king’s table.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan. He said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established.
