[{"header":"David and Jonathan Covenant"},{"num":20,"verse":"Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?”"},{"num":2,"verse":"He said to him, “Far from it, you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. So why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Yet David vowed again, saying, “Your father knows well that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be grieved.’ But truly as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, there is hardly a step between me and death.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I ought to sit down to eat with the king.
