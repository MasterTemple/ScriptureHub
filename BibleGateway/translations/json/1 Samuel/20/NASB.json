[{"header":"David and Jonathan’s Covenant"},{"num":20,"verse":"Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and he came and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?”"},{"num":2,"verse":"He said to him, “Far from it, you shall not die! Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without informing me. So why would my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Yet David vowed again, saying, “Your father is well aware that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, ‘Jonathan is not to know this, otherwise he will be worried.’ But indeed as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, there is just a step between me and death.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I am obligated to sit down to eat with the king. But let me go so that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening."},{"num":6,"verse":"If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly requested leave of me to run to Bethlehem, his city, because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.’"},{"num":7,"verse":"If he says, ‘That is good,’ your servant will be safe; but if he is very angry, be aware that he has decided on evil."},{"num":8,"verse":"So deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you. But if I am guilty of wrongdoing, kill me yourself; for why then should you bring me to your father?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I in fact learn that my father has decided to inflict harm on you, would I not inform you?”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will inform me if your father answers you harshly?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “Come, and let’s go out to the field.” So both of them went out to the field."},{"num":12,"verse":"Then Jonathan said to David, “The Lord, the God of Israel, is my witness!

Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?"},{"num":31,"verse":"For, as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now then, send men and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die!”"},{"num":32,"verse":"But Jonathan replied to his father Saul and said to him, “Why must he be put to death? What has he done?”"},{"num":33,"verse":"Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike and kill him; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death."},{"num":34,"verse":"Then Jonathan got up from the table in the heat of anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, because he was worried about David since his father had insulted him."},{"num":35,"verse":"Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out to the field at the time agreed upon with David, and a little boy was with him."},{"num":36,"verse":"He said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot.” The boy ran, and he shot an arrow past him."},{"num":37,"verse":"When the boy reached the location of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, “Is the arrow not beyond you?”"},{"num":38,"verse":"Then Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry, be quick, do not stay!” And Jonathan’s boy picked up the arrow and came to his master."},{"num":39,"verse":"But the boy was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter."},{"num":40,"verse":"Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go, bring them to the city.”"},{"num":41,"verse":"When the boy was gone, David got up from the south side, then he fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times.
