How did I ·sin against [offend; wrong] your father? Why is he ·trying to kill me [seeking my life]?”"},{"num":2,"verse":"Jonathan answered, “·No [Never; Far from it]! You won’t die! See, my father doesn’t do anything ·great or small [important or unimportant] without first ·telling [confiding in] me. Why would he ·keep [hide] this from me? It’s not true!”"},{"num":3,"verse":"But David ·took an oath [vowed; swore], saying, “Your father knows very well that ·you like me [I have found favor in your sight]. He says to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know about it, or he will be ·upset [hurt; grieved].’ As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I am only a step away from death!”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “I’ll do ·anything you want me to do [for you whatever you say].”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival [Num. 29:6; 2 Chr. 8:13; Ezra 3:5; Col. 2:16].

But if he becomes angry, you will know that he ·wants to hurt me [is determined to harm me; has an evil plan]. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Jonathan, ·be loyal [show kindness/faithful love] to me, your servant. You have made an ·agreement [covenant; solemn pact] with me before the Lord. If I ·am guilty [have sinned], you may kill me yourself! Why ·hand me over [betray me] to your father?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Jonathan answered, “·No, never [Far be it from you]! If I learn that my father ·plans to hurt you [decided on evil], ·I will warn you [wouldn’t I tell you?]!”"},{"num":10,"verse":"David asked, “Who will let me know if your father answers you ·unkindly [harshly]?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"Then Jonathan said [to David], “Come, let’s go out into the field.” So the two of them went out into the field."},{"num":12,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “·I promise this before [By] the Lord, the God of Israel: ·At [By] this same time ·the day after tomorrow [or tomorrow or the next day], I will ·find out how my father feels [sound out my father].

He said, “May the Lord ·hold David’s enemies responsible [or destroy David’s enemies].” "},{"num":17,"verse":"And Jonathan asked David to repeat his ·promise [vow; oath] of love for him, because he loved David as much as he loved ·himself [his own life/soul]."},{"num":18,"verse":"Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon festival [20:5]. Your ·seat [place] will be empty, so my father will miss you. "},{"num":19,"verse":"·On the third day [The day after tomorrow] go to the place where you hid when this trouble began.

Jonathan sat ·across from [facing] him, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David’s place was empty. "},{"num":26,"verse":"That day Saul said nothing.

"},{"num":29,"verse":"He said, ‘Let me go, because our ·family [whole clan] has a sacrifice in the town, and my brother has ·ordered [commanded] me to be there. Now if I ·am your friend [have found favor in your sight/eyes], please let me go to see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Then Saul ·became very angry with [burned with anger against] Jonathan. He said, “You son of a ·wicked, worthless woman [whore; rebellious slut]! ·I [Do I not…?] know you are on the side of David son of Jesse! ·You bring shame on yourself and on your mother who gave birth to you […to your own shame and the shame of your mother’s nakedness].

What wrong has he done?” "},{"num":33,"verse":"Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan, ·trying to kill [to strike] him. So Jonathan knew that his father ·really wanted [was determined] to kill David. "},{"num":34,"verse":"Jonathan ·was very angry [rose in fierce anger] and left the table. That second day of the ·month [or New Moon festival] he refused to eat. He ·was ashamed of his father and upset over David [grieved at his father’s shameful treatment of David; or grieved for David and because his father had disgraced/insulted/dishonored him]."},{"num":35,"verse":"The next morning Jonathan went out to the field to meet David as they had agreed.
