He had three thousand handpicked soldiers from Israel with him."},{"num":3,"verse":"Saul camped on Hachilah’s hill opposite Jeshimon beside the road, but David stayed in the wilderness. When David learned that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,"},{"num":4,"verse":"he sent spies and discovered that Saul had definitely arrived."},{"num":5,"verse":"So David got up and went to the place where Saul camped, and saw the place where Saul and Abner, Ner’s son and Saul’s general, were sleeping. Saul was sleeping inside the camp with the troops camped all around him."},{"num":6,"verse":"David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab’s brother Abishai, Zeruiah’s son, “Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"So David and Abishai approached the troops at night and found Saul lying there, asleep in the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the army were sleeping all around him."},{"num":8,"verse":"Abishai said to David, “God has handed your enemy over to you today! Let me pin him to the ground with my spear.

No one can lift a hand against the Lord’s anointed and go unpunished."},{"num":10,"verse":"As surely as the Lord lives,” David continued, “it will be the Lord who will strike him down, or his day will come and he will die, or he’ll fall in battle and be destroyed."},{"num":11,"verse":"The Lord forbid that I lift my hand against the Lord’s anointed!

Aren’t you going to answer me?”"},{"num":15,"verse":"David answered Abner, “You are a man, aren’t you? And you have no equal in Israel, right? Then why haven’t you kept watch over your master the king? One of the soldiers came to kill your master the king."},{"num":16,"verse":"What you’ve done is terrible!

If it is the Lord who has incited you against me, then let him accept an offering!

You will accomplish much and will certainly succeed.” Then David went on his way, but Saul went back home."}]
