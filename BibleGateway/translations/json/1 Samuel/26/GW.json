[{"header":"Saul’s Final Pursuit of David"},{"num":26,"verse":"The people of Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah. “David is hiding at the hill of Hachilah near Jeshimon,” they said."},{"num":2,"verse":"Saul went to the desert of Ziph, taking with him 3,000 of Israel’s best-trained men to search for David. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Saul camped by the road at the hill of Hachilah near Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he realized Saul had come to the desert for him, "},{"num":4,"verse":"David sent spies to confirm that Saul had arrived."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then David went to the place where Saul had camped. David saw the place where Saul and Ner’s son Abner, the commander of the army, were lying. Saul was lying in the camp, and the troops were camped around him."},{"num":6,"verse":"David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai, who was Zeruiah’s son and Joab’s brother, “Who will go with me to Saul in the camp?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"So David and Abishai went among ⌞Saul’s⌟ troops that night. Saul was lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Abishai said to David, “Today God has turned your enemy over to you. Please let me nail him to the ground with one stab of the spear. I won’t have to do it twice!”"},{"num":9,"verse":"“Don’t kill him!” David told Abishai. “No one has ever attacked the Lord’s anointed king and remained free of guilt.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"Then David called to the troops and to Ner’s son Abner. “Won’t you answer, Abner?” he asked."},{"num":15,"verse":"David asked Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Is there anyone like you in Israel? Then why didn’t you guard your master, the king? Someone came to kill His Royal Majesty. "},{"num":16,"verse":"What you’ve done isn’t good. I solemnly swear, as the Lord lives, you are dead men. You didn’t guard your master, the Lord’s anointed king. Look at the king’s spear and the jar of water that were near his head.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"Saul recognized David’s voice. “Is that your voice, my servant David?” he asked."},{"num":18,"verse":"“Why are you pursuing me?” he added. “What have I done? What crime have I committed? "},{"num":19,"verse":"Your Majesty, please listen to my words. If the Lord has turned you against me, let him be satisfied with an offering. But if mere mortals ⌞have turned you against me⌟, let them be cursed by the Lord. They have prevented me from having a share of the Lord’s inheritance. ‘Go and serve other gods,’ they tell me. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Don’t let my blood fall to the ground, away from the Lord’s presence.

One of the young men should come over and get it. "},{"num":23,"verse":"The Lord will reward any person who is righteous and faithful. The Lord handed you over to me today, but I refused to attack the Lord’s anointed king.

You will accomplish many things and certainly will succeed.”"}]
