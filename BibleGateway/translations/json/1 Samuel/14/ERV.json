[{"header":"Jonathan Attacks the Philistines"},{"num":14,"verse":"That day, Saul’s son Jonathan was talking with the young man who carried his weapons.

Saul had about 600 men with him."},{"num":3,"verse":"One of the men was named Ahijah. Ahijah was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub. Ahitub was the son of Phinehas. Phinehas was the son of Eli. Eli had been the Lord’s priest at Shiloh. Now Ahijah was the priest who wore the ephod."},{"num":4,"verse":"Jonathan was planning to go through a pass to get to the Philistine camp.

Whatever you decide, I am with you all the way.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Jonathan said, “Let’s go! We’ll cross the valley and go to the Philistine guards. We’ll let them see us."},{"num":9,"verse":"If they say to us, ‘Stay there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are. We won’t go up to them."},{"num":10,"verse":"But if the Philistine men say, ‘Come up here,’ then we will climb up to them. That will be a sign from God. That will mean that the Lord will allow us to defeat them.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"So Jonathan and his helper let the Philistines see them. The Philistine guards said, “Look! The Hebrews are coming out of the holes they were hiding in.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"The Philistines in the fort shouted to Jonathan and his helper, “Come up here. We’ll teach you a lesson.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"So Jonathan climbed up the hill with his hands and feet, and his helper was right behind him. Jonathan and his helper attacked them.

His helper came behind him and killed the men who were only wounded."},{"num":15,"verse":"Great fear spread among the Philistine soldiers—those in the field, in the camp, and at the fort.

The whole army was with Saul—he now had about 10,000 men. The battle spread to every city in the hill country of Ephraim."},{"header":"Saul Makes Another Mistake"},{"num":24,"verse":"But Saul made a big mistake that day.

So none of them ate anything."},{"num":25,"verse":"Because of the fighting, the people went into some woods. Then they saw a honeycomb on the ground. The Israelites went up to the honeycomb, but they didn’t eat any of it. They were afraid to break the promise."},{"num":27,"verse":"But Jonathan didn’t know about the oath.

He ate the honey and began to feel much better."},{"num":28,"verse":"One of the soldiers told Jonathan, “Your father forced the soldiers to make a special promise. He said that any man who eats today will be under a curse. So the men have not eaten anything. That’s why they are weak.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"Jonathan said, “My father has brought a lot of trouble to the land. See how much better I feel after tasting just a little of this honey."},{"num":30,"verse":"It would have been much better for the men to eat the food that they took from their enemies today. We could have killed more Philistines.”"},{"num":31,"verse":"That day the Israelites defeated the Philistines. They fought them all the way from Micmash to Aijalon.

And the blood was still in the animals."},{"num":33,"verse":"Someone said to Saul, “Look, the men are sinning against the Lord. They’re eating meat that still has blood in it!”"},{"num":34,"verse":"Then Saul said, “Go to the men and tell them that each one must bring his bull and sheep to me.

Jonathan, you must die.”"},{"num":45,"verse":"But the soldiers said to Saul, “Jonathan led Israel to a great victory today. Must Jonathan die? Never! As surely as the Lord lives, not one hair of Jonathan’s head will fall to the ground!
