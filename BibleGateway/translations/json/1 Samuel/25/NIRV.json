[{"header":"David, Nabal and Abigail"},{"num":25,"verse":"When Samuel died, the whole nation of Israel gathered together. They were filled with sorrow because he was dead. They buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David went down into the Desert of Paran."},{"num":2,"verse":"A certain man in Maon was very wealthy. He owned property there at Carmel. He had 1,000 goats and 3,000 sheep. He was clipping the wool off the sheep in Carmel. "},{"num":3,"verse":"His name was Nabal. His wife’s name was Abigail. She was a wise and beautiful woman.

While he was there, he heard that Nabal was clipping the wool off his sheep. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So he sent for ten young men. He said to them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel. Greet him for me. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Say to him, ‘May you live a long time! May everything go well with you and your family! And may things go well with everything that belongs to you!"},{"num":7,"verse":"“ ‘I hear that you are clipping the wool off your sheep. When your shepherds were with us, we treated them well. The whole time they were at Carmel nothing that belonged to them was stolen. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Ask your own servants. They’ll tell you. We’ve come to you now at a happy time of the year. Please be kind to my men. Please give me and my men anything you can find for us.’ ”"},{"num":9,"verse":"When David’s men arrived, they gave Nabal the message from David. Then they waited."},{"num":10,"verse":"Nabal answered David’s servants, “Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are running away from their masters these days. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Why should I give away my bread and water? Why should I give away the meat I’ve prepared for those who clip the wool off my sheep?

"},{"num":13,"verse":"David said to his men, “Each of you put on your swords!” So they did. David put his sword on too. About 400 men went up with David. Two hundred men stayed behind with the supplies."},{"num":14,"verse":"One of the servants warned Abigail, Nabal’s wife. He said, “David sent some messengers from the desert to give his greetings to our master. But Nabal shouted at them and was rude to them. "},{"num":15,"verse":"David’s men had been very good to us. They treated us well. The whole time we were near them out in the fields, nothing was stolen. "},{"num":16,"verse":"We were taking care of our sheep near them. During that time, they were like a wall around us night and day. They kept us safe. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Now think it over. See what you can do. Horrible trouble will soon come to our master and his whole family. He’s such an evil man that no one can even talk to him.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Abigail didn’t waste any time. She got 200 loaves of bread and two bottles of wine. The bottles were made out of animal skins. She got five sheep that were ready to be cooked. She got a bushel of grain that had been cooked.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"Please don’t pay any attention to that evil man Nabal. His name means Foolish Person. And that’s exactly what he is. He’s always doing foolish things. I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to see the men you sent. "},{"num":26,"verse":"Sir, the Lord has kept you from killing Nabal and his men. He has kept you from using your own hands to get even.

"},{"num":31,"verse":"When that happens, you won’t have this heavy load on your mind. You won’t have to worry about how you killed people without any reason. You won’t have to worry about how you got even. The Lord your God will give you success. When that happens, please remember me.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"David said to Abigail, “Give praise to the Lord. He is the God of Israel. He has sent you today to find me. "},{"num":33,"verse":"May the Lord bless you for what you have done. You have shown a lot of good sense. You have kept me from killing Nabal and his men this day. You have kept me from using my own hands to get even. "},{"num":34,"verse":"It’s a good thing you came quickly to meet me. If you hadn’t come, not one of Nabal’s men would have been left alive by sunrise. And that’s just as sure as the Lord, the God of Israel, is alive. He has kept me from harming you.”"},{"num":35,"verse":"Then David accepted from her what she had brought him. He said, “Go home in peace. I’ve heard your words. I’ll do what you have asked.”"},{"num":36,"verse":"Abigail went back to Nabal. He was having a dinner party in the house. It was the kind of dinner a king would have.
