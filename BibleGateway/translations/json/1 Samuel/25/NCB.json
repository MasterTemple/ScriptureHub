He owned three thousand sheep and one thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."},{"num":3,"verse":"His name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was a good woman, intelligent and beautiful, but her husband, who was a Calebite, was difficult and disagreeable in his dealings."},{"num":4,"verse":"While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep."},{"num":5,"verse":"David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel and approach Nabal, greeting him in my name."},{"num":6,"verse":"Say to him, ‘May you have a long and pleasant life, and may your household prosper, and may all that you own multiply."},{"num":7,"verse":"I have heard that you were shearing. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harm them nor did anything that belonged to them go missing the whole time they were at Carmel."},{"num":8,"verse":"Ask your young men, and they will tell you.

They came back and told him all these things."},{"num":13,"verse":"David said to his men, “Let each man put on his sword.” Each man put on his sword, and David also put on his sword.

Please permit your handmaid to speak to you, hear what your handmaid has to say to you."},{"num":25,"verse":"“May my lord not pay attention to this man of Belial, Nabal. He is just like his name.
