He was a very important man and owned three thousand sheep and one thousand goats. At that time, he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."},{"num":3,"verse":"The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail.

He was a Calebite."},{"num":4,"verse":"While in the wilderness, David heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep."},{"num":5,"verse":"So David sent ten servants, telling them, “Go up to Carmel. When you get to Nabal, greet him for me."},{"num":6,"verse":"Say this to him: ‘Peace to you, your household, and all that is yours!"},{"num":7,"verse":"I’ve heard that you are now shearing sheep. As you know, your shepherds were with us in the wilderness. We didn’t mistreat them. Moreover, the whole time they were at Carmel, nothing of theirs went missing."},{"num":8,"verse":"Ask your servants; they will tell you the same. So please receive these young men favorably, because we’ve come on a special day.

Please let it be given to the young men who follow you, my master."},{"num":28,"verse":"Please forgive any offense by your servant.
