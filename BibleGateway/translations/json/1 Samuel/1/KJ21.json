[{"num":1,"verse":"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite."},{"num":2,"verse":"And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah.

And why eatest thou not? And why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. (Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord.)"},{"num":10,"verse":"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord and wept sorely."},{"num":11,"verse":"And she vowed a vow and said, “O Lord of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thine handmaid, and remember me and not forget Thine handmaid, but wilt give unto Thine handmaid a manchild, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli observed her mouth."},{"num":13,"verse":"Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard.
