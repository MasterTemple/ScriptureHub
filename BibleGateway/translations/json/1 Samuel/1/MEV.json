"},{"num":4,"verse":"When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved Hannah, but the Lord had closed her womb. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Now her rival provoked her greatly, making her miserable because the Lord had closed her womb. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Thus it was yearly, when she went up to the house of the Lord, that she provoked her. So Hannah wept and did not eat. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then said Elkanah her husband to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? And why do you not eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So Hannah arose after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a seat by the door of the tabernacle of the Lord. "},{"num":10,"verse":"And she was bitter, and prayed to the Lord, and wept severely.
