Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"This man went up from his city each year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, but the LORD had given her no children. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Hannah’s rival provoked her bitterly, to irritate  embarrass her, because the LORD had left her childless. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So it happened year after year, whenever she went up to the house of the LORD, Peninnah provoked her; so she wept and would not eat. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you cry and why do you not eat? Why are you so sad  discontent?

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Hannah was speaking in her heart (mind); only her lips were moving, and her voice was not heard, so Eli thought she was drunk.

Get rid of your wine.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman with a despairing spirit. I have not been drinking wine or  intoxicating drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Do not regard your maidservant as a wicked  worthless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and [bitter] provocation.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Hannah said, “Let your maidservant find grace  favor in your sight.” So the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer ."}],[{"type":"header","content":"Samuel Is Born to Hannah"},{"type":"prose","content":"The family got up early the next morning, worshiped before the LORD, and returned to their home in Ramah.
