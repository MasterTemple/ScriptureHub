[{"num":1,"verse":"¶ Now there was a certain man of Ramath of Zophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite."},{"num":2,"verse":"And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."},{"num":3,"verse":"And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of the hosts in Shiloh.

And why dost thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? Am I not better to thee than ten sons?"},{"num":9,"verse":"¶ So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD."},{"num":10,"verse":"And she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the LORD and wept sore;"},{"num":11,"verse":"and she vowed a vow and said, O LORD of the hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaid but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head."},{"num":12,"verse":"And it came to pass as she continued praying before the LORD that Eli was observing her mouth."},{"num":13,"verse":"Now Hannah spoke in her heart and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore, Eli thought she was drunk."},{"num":14,"verse":"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken?

And he worshipped the LORD there."}]
