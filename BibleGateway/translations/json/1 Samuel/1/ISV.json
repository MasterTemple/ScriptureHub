[{"header":"The Birth of Samuel"},{"num":1,"verse":"A certain man lived in Ramathaim-zophim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim.

"},{"num":8,"verse":"Elkanah her husband told her, “Hannah, why are you crying and why don’t you eat? Why are you upset? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Hannah got up after she had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the chair by the doorpost of the tent of the Lord. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Deeply distressed, she prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly.
