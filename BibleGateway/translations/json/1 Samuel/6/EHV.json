Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been removed from you.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then they said, “What restitution offering should we send to him?”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Therefore you should make replicas of your tumors and figurines of the mice that are ruining your land, and you will give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand on you, on your gods, and on your land. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Why harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?
