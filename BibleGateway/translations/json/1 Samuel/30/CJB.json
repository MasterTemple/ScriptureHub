[{"num":30,"verse":"Three days later, when David and his men arrived in Ziklag, they found that the ‘Amaleki had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had sacked Ziklag and burned it down; "},{"num":2,"verse":"and they had taken captive the women and everyone there, great and small. They hadn’t killed anyone but had carried them off as they went on their way. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So when David and his men arrived at the city, there it was, burned down, with their wives, sons and daughters taken captive. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then David and the people with him cried aloud until they had no more power to cry. "},{"num":5,"verse":"David’s two wives had been taken captive — Achino‘am from Yizre‘el and Avigayil the widow of Naval from Karmel."},{"num":6,"verse":"David was in serious trouble: the people were talking about stoning him to death, because all the people were in such deep grief, each man over his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in Adonai his God. "},{"num":7,"verse":"David said to Avyatar the cohen, the son of Achimelekh, “Please bring the ritual vest here to me.” Avyatar brought the vest to David. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then David consulted Adonai. He asked, “Should I go in pursuit of these raiders? Will I catch up with them?” And [Adonai] answered him, “Go in pursuit, because you will overtake them and recover everyone and everything.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"So David went, he and the six hundred men with him. They came to Vadi B’sor, where those who were to stay behind waited. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then David continued in pursuit with four hundred men, while two hundred too exhausted to cross Vadi B’sor stayed behind."},{"num":11,"verse":"They found an Egyptian in the countryside and brought him to David. They gave him some bread to eat and water to drink; "},{"num":12,"verse":"they also gave him a lump of dried figs and two bunches of raisins.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"David attacked them from dawn until the evening of the next day. Not one of them escaped, except for 400 young men who jumped on camels and got away. "},{"num":18,"verse":"David recovered all that the ‘Amaleki had taken; he also rescued his two wives. "},{"num":19,"verse":"They found nothing missing, big or little — not sons, not daughters, not plundered goods or anything else they had taken — David brought it all back.

"},{"num":22,"verse":"But some of the men who had gone with David were evil men, scoundrels; and they said, “They didn’t go with us, so we’re not giving them any of the property we’ve recovered.
