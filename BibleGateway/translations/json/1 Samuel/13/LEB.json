[{"header":"Saul Rules over Israel"},{"num":13,"verse":"Saul was thirty years old at the beginning of his reign, and he reigned forty-two years over Israel. "},{"num":2,"verse":"He chose for himself three thousand from Israel.

Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” "},{"num":4,"verse":"And all Israel did hear, saying, “Saul has defeated the garrison of the Philistines; and also, Israel has become a stench among the Philistines!” So the people were called out after Saul at Gilgal."},{"header":"Saul’s Blunder"},{"num":5,"verse":"And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and an army as numerous as sand which is on the seashore. And they came up and encamped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven."},{"num":6,"verse":"When the men of Israel saw that it was too difficult for them, because the army was hard pressed, the people hid themselves in the caves, in the thorn bushes, in the cliffs, in the vaults and in the wells. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the army followed him trembling.

You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God which he commanded you. For then, Yahweh would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
