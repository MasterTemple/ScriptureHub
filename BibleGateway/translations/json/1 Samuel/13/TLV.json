[{"header":"Saul’s Misguided Sacrifice"},{"num":13,"verse":"Saul was 30 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for 42 years over Israel.

So Saul blew the shofar throughout the country, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"All Israel heard the news, “Saul had struck down the garrison of the Philistines, so Israel has become a stench to the Philistines.” Then the people were summoned to Saul at Gilgal. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Meanwhile the Philistines assembled themselves to fight with Israel: 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They marched up and camped in Michmas, east of Beth-aven."},{"num":6,"verse":"When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble, because the people were hard-pressed, they hid in caves, thickets, cliffs, crevices and pits.
