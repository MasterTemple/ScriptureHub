[{"header":"Elihu Keeps On Speaking"},{"num":34,"verse":"Then Elihu said, "},{"num":2,"verse":"“Hear my words, you wise men. Listen to me, you who know. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Let us choose for ourselves what is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good. "},{"num":5,"verse":"For Job has said, ‘I am right and good, but God has taken away my right. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Would I lie about my right? I have been hurt so that I cannot be healed, but I have done no wrong.’ "},{"num":7,"verse":"What man is like Job, who drinks up words against him like water? "},{"num":8,"verse":"He goes among those who do wrong, and walks with sinful men. "},{"num":9,"verse":"For he has said, ‘A man gets nothing by trying to please God.’"},{"num":10,"verse":"“So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do what is sinful, and from the All-powerful to do wrong. "},{"num":11,"verse":"For He pays a man by the work he does. He will see that a man is paid for what he does. "},{"num":12,"verse":"For sure God will not do wrong. The All-powerful will not turn what is right into sin. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Who gave Him the power over the earth? Who gave Him the whole world to take care of? "},{"num":14,"verse":"If He should take back His spirit and His breath, "},{"num":15,"verse":"all flesh would die together, and man would return to dust."},{"num":16,"verse":"“If you have understanding, hear this. Listen to what I say. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Should one who hates what is right be the one to rule? Will you say that He Who is right and good and strong is guilty? "},{"num":18,"verse":"Who says to a king, ‘You are of no worth,’ and to rulers, ‘You are sinful’? "},{"num":19,"verse":"Who shows no favor to princes, or thinks of the rich as more important than the poor? They are all the work of His hands. "},{"num":20,"verse":"In a short time they die. At midnight the people are shaken and pass away. And the powerful are taken away by no human hand."},{"num":21,"verse":"“For God’s eyes are upon the ways of a man, and He sees all his steps. "},{"num":22,"verse":"There is no darkness or shadow where sinners can hide themselves. "},{"num":23,"verse":"For God does not need to set a time for man to go before Him and be judged. "},{"num":24,"verse":"He breaks powerful men in pieces without asking any reason, and puts others in their place. "},{"num":25,"verse":"For He knows their works. He puts them down in the night, and they are crushed. "},{"num":26,"verse":"God punishes them for their sin where everyone can see them. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Because they turned aside from following Him. They did not care about any of His ways. "},{"num":28,"verse":"So they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him. And He heard the cry of those in need. "},{"num":29,"verse":"When He keeps quiet, who can say He is wrong? When He hides His face, who can see Him? But He is over both nation and man. "},{"num":30,"verse":"So men without God should not rule and should not be a trap for the people."},{"num":31,"verse":"“For has any one said to God, ‘I have suffered punishment, and will not cause any more trouble? "},{"num":32,"verse":"Teach me what I cannot see. If I have sinned, I will do it no more’? "},{"num":33,"verse":"Will God ask what you want to do, when you will not do what He says? You must decide, and not I. So tell what you know. "},{"num":34,"verse":"Men of understanding will say to me, and wise men who hear me say, "},{"num":35,"verse":"‘Job speaks without much learning. His words are without wisdom. "},{"num":36,"verse":"Job should be tried to the end, because he answers like sinful men. "},{"num":37,"verse":"To his sin he adds a strong will against God. Making fun he claps his hands among us, and speaks many words against God.’”"}]
