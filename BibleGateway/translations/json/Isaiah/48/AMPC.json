[{"num":48,"verse":"Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel and who come forth from the seed of Judah, you who swear allegiance by the name of the Lord and make mention of the God of Israel—but not in truth and sincerity, nor in righteousness (rightness and moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation)—"},{"num":2,"verse":"For they call themselves [citizens] of the holy city and depend on the God of Israel—the Lord of hosts is His name."},{"num":3,"verse":"I have declared from the beginning the former things [which happened in times past to Israel]; they went forth from My mouth and I made them known; then suddenly I did them, and they came to pass [says the Lord]."},{"num":4,"verse":"Because I knew that you were obstinate, and your neck was an iron sinew and your brow was brass,"},{"num":5,"verse":"Therefore I have declared things to come to you from of old; before they came to pass I announced them to you, so that you could not say, My idol has done them, and my graven image and my molten image have commanded them."},{"num":6,"verse":"You have heard [these things foretold], now you see this fulfillment. And will you not bear witness to it? I show you specified new things from this time forth, even hidden things [kept in reserve] which you have not known."},{"num":7,"verse":"They are created now [called into being by the prophetic word], and not long ago; and before today you have never heard of them, lest you should say, Behold, I knew them!"},{"num":8,"verse":"Yes, you have never heard, yes, you have never known; yes, from of old your ear has not been opened.
