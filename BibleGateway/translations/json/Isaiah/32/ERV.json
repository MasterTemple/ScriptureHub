They would actually listen to what they hear."},{"num":4,"verse":"People who are now confused would be able to understand. Those who cannot speak clearly now would be able to speak clearly and quickly."},{"num":5,"verse":"Fools would not be called great men. People would not respect men who make secret plans."},{"num":6,"verse":"Fools say foolish things, and in their minds they plan evil things to do. They want to do what is wrong. They say bad things about the Lord. They don’t let hungry people eat their food. They don’t let thirsty people drink the water."},{"num":7,"verse":"They use evil like a tool and plan ways to steal from the poor.
