[{"num":50,"verse":"¶ Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities ye are sold, and for your rebellions was your mother put away,"},{"num":2,"verse":"for I came, and no one showed himself; I called, and no one answered. Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink because there is no water and die for thirst."},{"num":3,"verse":"I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering."},{"num":4,"verse":"¶ The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the wise that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary; he wakes up early, early shall he awaken my ear, that I might hear, as the wise."},{"num":5,"verse":"The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back."},{"num":6,"verse":"I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to those that plucked off the hair: I did not hide my face from shame and spitting."},{"num":7,"verse":"For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore, I was not ashamed; therefore, I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed."},{"num":8,"verse":"He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand together; who is my adversary? let him come near to me."},{"num":9,"verse":"Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up."},{"num":10,"verse":"¶ Who is among you that fears the LORD? Hearken unto the voice of his slave. He who walked in darkness and had no light; let him trust in the name of the LORD and stay upon his God."},{"num":11,"verse":"Behold, that all of you kindle fire and are compassed about with sparks; walk in the light of your fire and of the sparks that ye have kindled.
