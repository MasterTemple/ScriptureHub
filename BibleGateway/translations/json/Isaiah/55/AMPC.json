[{"num":55,"verse":"Wait and listen, everyone who is thirsty! Come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat!

Hearken diligently to Me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness [the profuseness of spiritual joy]."},{"num":3,"verse":"Incline your ear [submit and consent to the divine will] and come to Me; hear, and your soul will revive; and I will make an everlasting covenant or league with you, even the sure mercy (kindness, goodwill, and compassion) promised to David."},{"num":4,"verse":"Behold, I have appointed him (Him) [David, as a representative of the Messiah, or the Messiah Himself] to be a witness [one (One) who shall testify of salvation] to the nations, a prince (Prince) and commander (Commander) to the peoples."},{"num":5,"verse":"Behold, you [Israel] shall call nations that you know not, and nations that do not know you shall run to you because of the Lord your God, and of the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified you."},{"num":6,"verse":"Seek, inquire for, and require the Lord while He may be found [claiming Him by necessity and by right]; call upon Him while He is near."},{"num":7,"verse":"Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and He will have love, pity, and mercy for him, and to our God, for He will multiply to him His abundant pardon."},{"num":8,"verse":"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, says the Lord."},{"num":9,"verse":"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts."},{"num":10,"verse":"For as the rain and snow come down from the heavens, and return not there again, but water the earth and make it bring forth and sprout, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,"},{"num":11,"verse":"So shall My word be that goes forth out of My mouth: it shall not return to Me void [without producing any effect, useless], but it shall accomplish that which I please and purpose, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it."},{"num":12,"verse":"For you shall go out [from the spiritual exile caused by sin and evil into the homeland] with joy and be led forth [by your Leader, the Lord Himself, and His word] with peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands."},{"num":13,"verse":"Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree; and it shall be to the Lord for a name of renown, for an everlasting sign [of jubilant exaltation] and memorial [to His praise], which shall not be cut off."}]
