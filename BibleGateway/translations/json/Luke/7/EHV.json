"},{"num":3,"verse":"When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. "},{"num":4,"verse":"When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy of having you do this for him, "},{"num":5,"verse":"because he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Jesus went with them.

"},{"num":7,"verse":"That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For I am also a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"When Jesus heard these things, he was amazed at him.
