"},{"num":7,"verse":"Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you; but say the word and let my servant be healed. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For I too am a person subject to authority, with soldiers subject to me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come here,’ and he comes; and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him and, turning, said to the crowd following him, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.” "},{"num":10,"verse":"When the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave in good health."},{"num":11,"verse":"Soon afterward he journeyed to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd accompanied him.

What are they like? "},{"num":32,"verse":"They are like children who sit in the marketplace and call to one another,"},{"num":33,"verse":"For John the Baptist came neither eating food nor drinking wine, and you said, ‘He is possessed by a demon.’ "},{"num":34,"verse":"The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you said, ‘Look, he is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ "},{"num":35,"verse":"But wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”"},{"num":36,"verse":"A Pharisee invited him to dine with him, and he entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at table.
