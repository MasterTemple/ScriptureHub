"},{"num":3,"verse":"When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him to ask him to come and save his servant’s life. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So they went to Jesus and begged him repeatedly, “He deserves to have this done for him, "},{"num":5,"verse":"because he loves our people and built our synagogue for us.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to tell Jesus, “Sir, stop troubling yourself, because I’m not worthy to have you come under my roof. "},{"num":7,"verse":"That’s why I didn’t presume to come to you. But just say the word, and let my servant be healed, "},{"num":8,"verse":"because I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one ‘Go’ and he goes, to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my servant ‘Do this’ and he does it.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found this kind of faith!” "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant in perfect health."},{"header":"Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son"},{"num":11,"verse":"Soon afterwards, Jesus went to a city called Nain.

"},{"num":32,"verse":"They’re like little children who sit in the marketplace and shout to each other,"},{"num":33,"verse":"Because John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, yet you say, ‘He has a demon!’ "},{"num":34,"verse":"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look!
