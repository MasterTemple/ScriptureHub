Then he went into Capernaum."},{"num":2,"verse":"In Capernaum there was an army officer. He had a servant who was very sick; he was near death. The officer loved the servant very much."},{"num":3,"verse":"When he heard about Jesus, he sent some older Jewish leaders to him. He wanted the men to ask Jesus to come and save the life of his servant."},{"num":4,"verse":"The men went to Jesus. They begged Jesus to help the officer. They said, “This officer is worthy to have your help."},{"num":5,"verse":"He loves our people and he built the synagogue for us.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Jesus went with them. He was coming near the officer’s house when the officer sent friends to say, “Lord, you don’t need to do anything special for me. I am not good enough for you to come into my house."},{"num":7,"verse":"That is why I did not come to you myself. You need only to give the order, and my servant will be healed."},{"num":8,"verse":"I know this because I am a man under the authority of other men. And I have soldiers under my authority. I tell one soldier, ‘Go,’ and he goes. And I tell another soldier, ‘Come,’ and he comes. And I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and my servant obeys me.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed.

There they found that the servant was healed."},{"header":"Jesus Brings a Woman’s Son Back to Life"},{"num":11,"verse":"The next day Jesus and his followers went to a town called Nain. A big crowd was traveling with them."},{"num":12,"verse":"When Jesus came near the town gate, he saw some people carrying a dead body. It was the only son of a woman who was a widow.

They began praising God and said, “A great prophet is here with us!” and “God is taking care of his people.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"This news about Jesus spread all over Judea and to all the other places around there."},{"header":"John Sends Men to Ask Jesus a Question(B)"},{"num":18,"verse":"John’s followers told him about all these things. John called for two of his followers."},{"num":19,"verse":"He sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one we heard was coming, or should we wait for someone else?”"},{"num":20,"verse":"So the men came to Jesus. They said, “John the Baptizer sent us to you with this question: ‘Are you the one who is coming, or should we wait for someone else?’”"},{"num":21,"verse":"Right then Jesus healed many people of their sicknesses and diseases. He healed those who had evil spirits and made many who were blind able to see again."},{"num":22,"verse":"Then he said to John’s followers, “Go tell John what you have seen and heard: The blind can see.

Someone who is weak, like a stem of grass blowing in the wind?"},{"num":25,"verse":"Really, what did you expect to see? Someone dressed in fine clothes? Of course not. People who wear fancy clothes and live in luxury are all in kings’ palaces."},{"num":26,"verse":"So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, John is a prophet. But I tell you, he is more than that."},{"num":27,"verse":"This Scripture was written about him:"},{"num":28,"verse":"I tell you, no one ever born is greater than John. But even the least important person in God’s kingdom is greater than John.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"(When the people heard this, they all agreed that God’s teaching was good. Even the tax collectors agreed. These were the people who were baptized by John."},{"num":30,"verse":"But the Pharisees and experts in the law refused to accept God’s plan for themselves; they did not let John baptize them.)"},{"num":31,"verse":"“What shall I say about the people of this time? What can I compare them to? What are they like?"},{"num":32,"verse":"They are like children sitting in the marketplace. One group of children calls to the other children and says,"},{"num":33,"verse":"John the Baptizer came and did not eat the usual food or drink wine. And you say, ‘He has a demon inside him.’"},{"num":34,"verse":"The Son of Man came eating and drinking. And you say, ‘Look at him! He eats too much and drinks too much wine! He is a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!’"},{"num":35,"verse":"But wisdom is shown to be right by those who accept it.”"},{"header":"Simon the Pharisee"},{"num":36,"verse":"One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him. Jesus went into the Pharisee’s house and took a place at the table."},{"num":37,"verse":"There was a sinful woman in that town. She knew that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house. So the woman brought some expensive perfume in an alabaster jar."},{"num":38,"verse":"She stood at Jesus’ feet, crying. Then she began to wash his feet with her tears. She dried his feet with her hair. She kissed his feet many times and rubbed them with the perfume."},{"num":39,"verse":"When the Pharisee who asked Jesus to come to his house saw this, he thought to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know that the woman who is touching him is a sinner!”"},{"num":40,"verse":"In response, Jesus said to the Pharisee, “Simon, I have something to say to you.”"},{"num":41,"verse":"Jesus said, “There were two men. Both men owed money to the same banker. One man owed him 500 silver coins. The other man owed him 50 silver coins."},{"num":42,"verse":"The men had no money, so they could not pay their debt.

Which one of those two men will love him more?”"},{"num":43,"verse":"Simon answered, “I think it would be the one who owed him the most money.”"},{"num":44,"verse":"Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? When I came into your house, you gave me no water for my feet.

This is clear, because she showed great love. People who are forgiven only a little will love only a little.”"},{"num":48,"verse":"Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”"},{"num":49,"verse":"The people sitting at the table began to think to themselves, “Who does this man think he is? How can he forgive sins?”"},{"num":50,"verse":"Jesus said to the woman, “Because you believed, you are saved from your sins. Go in peace.”"}]
