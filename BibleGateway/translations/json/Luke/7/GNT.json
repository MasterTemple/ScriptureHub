"},{"num":3,"verse":"When the officer heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask him to come and heal his servant. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They came to Jesus and begged him earnestly, “This man really deserves your help. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He loves our people and he himself built a synagogue for us.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the officer sent friends to tell him, “Sir, don't trouble yourself. I do not deserve to have you come into my house, "},{"num":7,"verse":"neither do I consider myself worthy to come to you in person. Just give the order, and my servant will get well. "},{"num":8,"verse":"I, too, am a man placed under the authority of superior officers, and I have soldiers under me. I order this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; I order that one, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and I order my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Jesus was surprised when he heard this; he turned around and said to the crowd following him, “I tell you, I have never found faith like this, not even in Israel!”"},{"num":10,"verse":"The messengers went back to the officer's house and found his servant well."},{"header":"Jesus Raises a Widow's Son"},{"num":11,"verse":"Soon afterward Jesus went to a town named Nain, accompanied by his disciples and a large crowd.

"},{"num":22,"verse":"He answered John's messengers, “Go back and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind can see, the lame can walk, those who suffer from dreaded skin diseases are made clean, the deaf can hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is preached to the poor.

"},{"num":26,"verse":"Tell me, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes indeed, but you saw much more than a prophet. "},{"num":27,"verse":"For John is the one of whom the scripture says: ‘God said, I will send my messenger ahead of you to open the way for you.’ "},{"num":28,"verse":"I tell you,” Jesus added, “John is greater than anyone who has ever lived. But the one who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than John.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"All the people heard him; they and especially the tax collectors were the ones who had obeyed God's righteous demands and had been baptized by John. "},{"num":30,"verse":"But the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law rejected God's purpose for themselves and refused to be baptized by John."},{"num":31,"verse":"Jesus continued, “Now to what can I compare the people of this day? What are they like? "},{"num":32,"verse":"They are like children sitting in the marketplace. One group shouts to the other, ‘We played wedding music for you, but you wouldn't dance! We sang funeral songs, but you wouldn't cry!’ "},{"num":33,"verse":"John the Baptist came, and he fasted and drank no wine, and you said, ‘He has a demon in him!’ "},{"num":34,"verse":"The Son of Man came, and he ate and drank, and you said, ‘Look at this man!

"},{"num":37,"verse":"In that town was a woman who lived a sinful life. She heard that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee's house, so she brought an alabaster jar full of perfume "},{"num":38,"verse":"and stood behind Jesus, by his feet, crying and wetting his feet with her tears. Then she dried his feet with her hair, kissed them, and poured the perfume on them. "},{"num":39,"verse":"When the Pharisee saw this, he said to himself, “If this man really were a prophet, he would know who this woman is who is touching him; he would know what kind of sinful life she lives!”"},{"num":40,"verse":"Jesus spoke up and said to him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.”"},{"num":41,"verse":"“There were two men who owed money to a moneylender,” Jesus began. “One owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other owed him fifty. "},{"num":42,"verse":"Neither of them could pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Which one, then, will love him more?”"},{"num":43,"verse":"“I suppose,” answered Simon, “that it would be the one who was forgiven more.”"},{"num":44,"verse":"Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your home, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.
