For forty wilderness days and nights he was tested by the Devil. He ate nothing during those days, and when the time was up he was hungry."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The Devil, playing on his hunger, gave the first test: “Since you’re God’s Son, command this stone to turn into a loaf of bread.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Jesus answered by quoting Deuteronomy: “It takes more than bread to really live.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For the second test he led him up and spread out all the kingdoms of the earth on display at once. Then the Devil said, “They’re yours in all their splendor to serve your pleasure. I’m in charge of them all and can turn them over to whomever I wish. Worship me and they’re yours, the whole works.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Jesus refused, again backing his refusal with Deuteronomy: “Worship the Lord your God and only the Lord your God. Serve him with absolute single-heartedness.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For the third test the Devil took him to Jerusalem and put him on top of the Temple. He said, “If you are God’s Son, jump.

Every eye in the place was on him, intent. Then he started in, “You’ve just heard Scripture make history. It came true just now in this place.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"All who were there, watching and listening, were surprised at how well he spoke. But they also said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son, the one we’ve known since he was just a kid?”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He answered, “I suppose you’re going to quote the proverb, ‘Doctor, go heal yourself. Do here in your hometown what we heard you did in Capernaum.’ Well, let me tell you something: No prophet is ever welcomed in his hometown. Isn’t it a fact that there were many widows in Israel at the time of Elijah during that three and a half years of drought when famine devastated the land, but the only widow to whom Elijah was sent was in Sarepta in Sidon? And there were many lepers in Israel at the time of the prophet Elisha but the only one cleansed was Naaman the Syrian.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"That set everyone in the meeting place seething with anger.

You’re the Holy One of God and you’ve come to destroy us!”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Jesus shut him up: “Quiet! Get out of him!” The demonic spirit threw the man down in front of them all and left. The demon didn’t hurt him."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"That knocked the wind out of everyone and got them whispering and wondering, “What’s going on here? Someone whose words make things happen? Someone who orders demonic spirits to get out and they go?” Jesus was the talk of the town."}],[{"type":"header","content":"He Healed Them All"},{"type":"prose","content":"He left the meeting place and went to Simon’s house.
