They said, “We found this man undermining our law and order, forbidding taxes to be paid to Caesar, setting himself up as Messiah-King.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Pilate asked him, “Is this true that you’re ‘King of the Jews’?”“Those are your words, not mine,” Jesus replied."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Pilate told the high priests and the accompanying crowd, “I find nothing wrong here.

He’s a dangerous man, endangering the peace.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When Pilate heard that, he asked, “So, he’s a Galilean?” Realizing that he properly came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he passed the buck to Herod, who just happened to be in Jerusalem for a few days."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Herod was delighted when Jesus showed up. He had wanted for a long time to see him, he’d heard so much about him. He hoped to see him do something spectacular. He peppered him with questions. Jesus didn’t answer—not one word.

Crucify him!”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He tried a third time. “But for what crime? I’ve found nothing in him deserving death. I’m going to warn him to watch his step and let him go.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But they kept at it, a shouting mob, demanding that he be crucified. And finally they shouted him down.

A huge crowd of people followed, along with women weeping and carrying on. At one point Jesus turned to the women and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t cry for me. Cry for yourselves and for your children. The time is coming when they’ll say, ‘Lucky the women who never conceived! Lucky the wombs that never gave birth! Lucky the breasts that never gave milk!’ Then they’ll start calling to the mountains, ‘Fall down on us!’ calling to the hills, ‘Cover us up!’ If people do these things to a live, green tree, can you imagine what they’ll do with deadwood?”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Two others, both criminals, were taken along with him for execution."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When they got to the place called Skull Hill, they crucified him, along with the criminals, one on his right, the other on his left."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Jesus prayed, “Father, forgive them; they don’t know what they’re doing.”Dividing up his clothes, they threw dice for them.

The Chosen—ha!”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The soldiers also came up and poked fun at him, making a game of it. They toasted him with sour wine: “So you’re King of the Jews!
