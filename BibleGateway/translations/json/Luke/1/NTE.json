His wife, who came from the Aaron family, was called Elisabeth. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Both of them were righteous in God’s sight; they followed all the Lord’s commandments and ordinances without fault. "},{"num":7,"verse":"They had no children. Elisabeth was barren, and both of them were of an advanced age."},{"num":8,"verse":"It so happened, when Zechariah was performing his priestly service before God, according to the order of his division, "},{"num":9,"verse":"that the lot fell to him, according to the priestly custom, to go in to the Lord’s sanctuary to offer incense.

He will get ready for the Lord a prepared people.’"},{"num":18,"verse":"‘How can I be sure of this?’ said Zechariah to the angel. ‘I’m an old man! My wife’s not as young as she used to be, either!’"},{"num":19,"verse":"‘Look here,’ replied the angel, ‘I’m Gabriel. I stand in God’s presence. I was sent to speak to you and give you this splendid news. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Now, listen: you will be silent – you won’t be able to speak – until the day when it all happens, because you didn’t believe my words.
