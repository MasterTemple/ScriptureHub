Get your report in order, for you are to be dismissed.’"},{"num":3,"verse":"“The accountant thought to himself, ‘Now what?

And then I’ll have plenty of friends to take care of me when I leave!’"},{"num":5,"verse":"“So he invited each one who owed money to his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first one, ‘How much do you owe him?’ ‘My debt is 850 gallons of olive oil,’ the man replied. ‘Yes, here is the contract you signed,’ the accountant told him. ‘Tear it up and write another one for half that much!’"},{"num":7,"verse":"“‘And how much do you owe him?’ he asked the next man. ‘A thousand bushels of wheat,’ was the reply. ‘Here,’ the accountant said, ‘take your note and replace it with one for only 800 bushels!’"},{"num":8,"verse":"“The rich man had to admire the rascal for being so shrewd.
