And I want a complete audit of your books.’"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"“The manager said to himself, ‘What am I going to do? I’ve lost my job as manager.

And why? Because he knew how to look after himself. Streetwise people are smarter in this regard than law-abiding citizens. They are on constant alert, looking for angles, surviving by their wits. I want you to be smart in the same way—but for what is —using every adversity to stimulate you to creative survival, to concentrate your attention on the bare essentials, so you’ll live, really live, and not complacently just get by on good behavior.”"},{"type":"header","content":"God Sees Behind Appearances"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Jesus went on to make these comments:"},{"type":"poetry","content":"If you’re honest in small things,"},{"type":"poetry","content":""},{"type":"poetry","content":"If you’re a crook in small things,"},{"type":"poetry","content":""},{"type":"poetry","content":"If you’re not honest in small jobs,"},{"type":"poetry","content":""},{"type":"poetry","content":"No worker can serve two bosses:"},{"type":"poetry","content":""},{"type":"poetry","content":"Or adore the first and despise the second."},{"type":"poetry","content":""}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When the Pharisees, a money-obsessed bunch, heard him say these things, they rolled their eyes, dismissing him as hopelessly out of touch.
