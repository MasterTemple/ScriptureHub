"},{"num":3,"verse":"Go on your way; behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and greet no one along the way. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Into whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace to this household.’ "},{"num":6,"verse":"If a peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from one house to another. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set before you, "},{"num":9,"verse":"cure the sick in it and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God is at hand for you.’ "},{"num":10,"verse":"Whatever town you enter and they do not receive you, go out into the streets and say, "},{"num":11,"verse":"‘The dust of your town that clings to our feet, even that we shake off against you.’ Yet know this: the kingdom of God is at hand. "},{"num":12,"verse":"I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom on that day than for that town."},{"num":13,"verse":"“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!
