[{"header":"The Mission of the Seventy-Two"},{"num":10,"verse":"After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him two by two into every town and place where he himself was about to go. "},{"num":2,"verse":"He said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Go! I am sending you out like lambs surrounded by wolves. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Do not carry a money bag, a traveler’s bag, or sandals, and greet no one on the road. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Whenever you enter a house, first say, ‘May peace be on this house!’ "},{"num":6,"verse":"And if a peace-loving person is there, your peace will remain on him, but if not, it will return to you. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Stay in that same house, eating and drinking what they give you, for the worker deserves his pay. Do not move around from house to house. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Whenever you enter a town and the people welcome you, eat what is set before you. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Heal the sick in that town and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come upon you!’ "},{"num":10,"verse":"But whenever you enter a town and the people do not welcome you, go into its streets and say, "},{"num":11,"verse":"‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this: The kingdom of God has come.’ "},{"num":12,"verse":"I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town!"},{"num":13,"verse":"“Woe to you, Chorazin!

No, you will be thrown down to Hades!"},{"num":16,"verse":"“The one who listens to you listens to me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"Then the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name!” "},{"num":18,"verse":"So he said to them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Look, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and on the full force of the enemy, and nothing will hurt you.

Yes, Father, for this was your gracious will. "},{"num":22,"verse":"All things have been given to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son decides to reveal him.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!

"},{"num":31,"verse":"Now by chance a priest was going down that road, but when he saw the injured man he passed by on the other side. "},{"num":32,"verse":"So too a Levite, when he came up to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. "},{"num":33,"verse":"But a Samaritan who was traveling came to where the injured man was, and when he saw him, he felt compassion for him. "},{"num":34,"verse":"He went up to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring olive oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
