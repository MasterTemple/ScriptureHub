[{"header":"Preaching the Gospel"},{"num":8,"verse":"Soon afterward Jesus was traveling from one town and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him "},{"num":2,"verse":"and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out; "},{"num":3,"verse":"Joanna, the wife of Cuza, Herod’s household manager; Susanna; and many others who provided support for them out of their own possessions."},{"header":"The Parable of the Sower"},{"num":4,"verse":"As a large crowd was gathering and people from one town after another were making their way to him, he spoke using a parable. "},{"num":5,"verse":"“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the path. It was trampled, and the birds of the sky devoured it. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Other seed fell on rocky ground. As soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up with it and choked it. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Other seed fell into good soil. It grew and produced fruit—one hundred times as much as was sown.” As he said these things, he called out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!”"},{"num":9,"verse":"His disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”"},{"num":10,"verse":"He said, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest I speak in parables so that ‘even though they see, they may not see, and even though they hear, they may not understand.’ "},{"num":11,"verse":"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Those along the path are the ones who hear it, but then the Devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts to keep them from believing and being saved. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Those on the rocky ground are the ones who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, but they have no root. So they believe for a while, but then fall away in a time of testing. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The seeds that fell into the thorns are the ones who hear the word, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of life, so they do not mature. "},{"num":15,"verse":"And the seeds in the good ground are the ones who hear the word with an honest and good heart, hold on to it tightly, and produce fruit as they patiently endure."},{"num":16,"verse":"“No one lights a lamp and then hides it under a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand so that those who enter may see the light. "},{"num":17,"verse":"For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing is secret that will not be made known and come to light. "},{"num":18,"verse":"So listen carefully, because whoever has will be given more, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”"},{"header":"Jesus’ Mother and Brothers"},{"num":19,"verse":"Jesus’ mother and brothers came to him, but they could not get near him because of the crowd.

I beg you, don’t torment me!” "},{"num":29,"verse":"For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. In fact, the unclean spirit had seized him many times.
