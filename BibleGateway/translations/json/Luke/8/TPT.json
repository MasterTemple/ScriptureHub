[{"header":"Jesus Ministers throughout the Land"},{"num":8,"verse":"Soon afterward, Jesus began a ministry tour throughout the country, visiting cities and villages to announce the wonderful news of God’s kingdom. His twelve disciples traveled with him "},{"num":2,"verse":"as did a number of women who had been healed of many illnesses and set free from demonic power. One of the women was Mary who was from the village of Magdala, from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons. Among the women were Susanna and "},{"num":3,"verse":"Joanna, the wife of Chusa, who managed King Herod’s household. Many other women who supported Jesus’ ministry from their own personal finances also traveled with him."},{"header":"Mysteries of God’s Kingdom Realm"},{"num":4,"verse":"Massive crowds gathered from many towns to hear Jesus, and he taught them using metaphors and parables, such as this:"},{"num":5,"verse":"“A farmer went out to sow seeds for a harvest. As he scattered his seeds, some of them fell on the hard pathway and were quickly trampled down and unable to grow and became nothing but bird seed. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Some fell on the gravel, and though they sprouted they couldn’t take root; it withered for lack of moisture. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Other seeds fell where there was nothing but weeds. They too were unable to grow to full maturity, for the weeds choked them out. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Yet some of the seeds fell into good, fertile soil, and they grew and flourished until they produced more than a hundredfold harvest, a bumper crop.” Then Jesus added, shouting out to all who would hear, “Listen with your heart and you will understand!”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Later his disciples came to him privately to ask him what deeper meaning they could find in this parable. "},{"num":10,"verse":"He said, “You have been given a teachable heart to perceive the secret, hidden mysteries of God’s kingdom realm. But to those without a listening heart, my words are merely stories. Even though they have eyes, they are blind to the true meaning of what I say, and even though they listen, they won’t receive full revelation."},{"num":11,"verse":"“Here, then, is the deeper meaning to my parable: The word of God is the seed that is sown into hearts.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"The seeds falling on gravel represents those who initially respond to the word with joy, but soon afterward, when a season of difficulty and harassment of the enemy comes to them, they wither and fall away, for they have no root in the truth and their faith is temporary. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The seeds that fall into the weeds represents the hearts of those who hear the word of God but their growth is quickly choked off by their own anxious cares, the riches of this world, and the fleeting pleasures of this life. This is why they never become mature and fruitful. "},{"num":15,"verse":"The seed that fell into good, fertile soil represents those lovers of truth who hear it deep within their hearts. They respond by clinging to the word, keeping it dear as they endure all things in faith. This is the seed that will one day bear much fruit in their lives.”"},{"header":"The Revelation Light"},{"num":16,"verse":"“No one lights a lamp and then hides it, covering it over or putting it where no one sees its light. No, he places the lamp on a lampstand so others benefit from its brightness. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Because this revelation lamp now shines within you, nothing will be hidden from you—it will all be revealed. Every secret of the kingdom will be unveiled and out in the open, made known by the revelation-light. "},{"num":18,"verse":"So pay careful attention to your hearts as you listen to my teaching, for to those who have open hearts, even more revelation will be given to them until it overflows. And for those who do not listen with open hearts, what little light they imagine themselves to have will be taken away.”"},{"header":"Jesus’ True Family"},{"num":19,"verse":"Jesus’ mother and his brothers came to where Jesus was teaching, but they couldn’t get through the crowd that had gathered around him.

But a fierce wind arose and became a violent squall that threatened to swamp their boat. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Alarmed, the disciples woke Jesus up and said, “Master, Master, we’re sinking! Don’t you care that we’re going to drown?”"},{"num":25,"verse":"Then Jesus said to them, “Why are you fearful? Have you lost your faith in me?”"},{"header":"A Demonized Man Set Free"},{"num":26,"verse":"As soon as they stepped ashore on the eastern side of the lake in the land of the Gerasenes, the disciples were confronted by a demon-possessed madman from a nearby town. Many times he had been put under guard and bound with chains, but the many demons inside him had repeatedly thrown him into convulsions, breaking his shackles and driving him out of the town into the countryside. He had been demonized for a long time and was living naked in a cemetery among the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet and screamed out, “What are you doing here? You are Jesus, the Son of the Most High God!”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Jesus asked the man, “What is your name?”"},{"num":31,"verse":"We beg you, don’t banish us into the Abyss!”"},{"num":32,"verse":"On the hillside nearby, there was a large herd of pigs, and the demons pleaded with Jesus, “Let us enter into the pigs.” "},{"num":33,"verse":"So Jesus ordered all the “mob” of demons to come out of the man and enter the pigs. The crazed herd of swine stampeded over the cliff into the lake and all of them drowned."},{"num":34,"verse":"When the herders tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off in fear and reported it to the nearby town and throughout the countryside. "},{"num":35,"verse":"Then the people of the region came out to see for themselves what had happened. When they came to where Jesus was, they discovered the notorious madman totally set free. He was clothed, speaking intelligently, and sitting at the feet of Jesus. They were shocked!

"},{"num":41,"verse":"Just then, a man named Jairus, the leader of the local Jewish congregation, fell before Jesus’ feet. He desperately begged him to come and heal his twelve-year-old daughter, his only child, because she was at the point of death."},{"num":43,"verse":"In the crowd that day was a woman who had suffered greatly for twelve years from slow bleeding. Even though she had spent all that she had on healers, she was still suffering. "},{"num":44,"verse":"Pressing in through the crowd, she came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of his garment. Instantly her bleeding stopped and she was healed."},{"num":45,"verse":"Jesus suddenly stopped and said to his disciples, “Someone touched me. Who was it?”"},{"num":46,"verse":"Jesus replied, “Yes, but I felt power surge through me. Someone touched me to be healed, and they received their healing.”"},{"num":47,"verse":"When the woman realized she couldn’t hide any longer, she came and fell trembling at Jesus’ feet.
