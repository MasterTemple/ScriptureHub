They preached the good news, and they healed the sick everywhere they went."},{"num":7,"verse":"Their mission didn’t go unnoticed. The local official installed by Rome, Herod, was especially anxious about the news because rumors were flying.

When they awakened, they looked over at Jesus and saw something inexplicable happening. Jesus was changing before their eyes, beginning with His face. It seemed to glow. The glow spread, and even His clothing took on a blinding whiteness. Then, two figures appeared in the glorious radiance emanating from Jesus. The three disciples somehow knew that these figures were Moses and Elijah. Peter, James, and John overheard the conversation that took place among Jesus, Moses, and Elijah—a conversation that centered on Jesus’ “departure” and how He would accomplish this departure from the capital city, Jerusalem."},{"num":33,"verse":"The glow began to fade, and it was clear that Moses and Elijah were about to disappear."},{"num":34,"verse":"While he spoke a cloud descended, and they were enveloped in it, and fear fell on them.
