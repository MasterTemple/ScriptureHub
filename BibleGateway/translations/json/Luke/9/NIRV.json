They announced the good news and healed people everywhere."},{"num":7,"verse":"Now Herod, the ruler of Galilee, heard about everything that was going on.

Let us put up three shelters. One will be for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter didn’t really know what he was saying."},{"num":34,"verse":"While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them.
