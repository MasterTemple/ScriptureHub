But they were trying to find a quiet way to do it, because they were afraid of what the people would do."},{"header":"Judas Agrees to Help Jesus’ Enemies(B)"},{"num":3,"verse":"One of Jesus’ twelve apostles was named Judas Iscariot. Satan entered him,"},{"num":4,"verse":"and he went and talked with the leading priests and some of the soldiers who guarded the Temple. He talked to them about a way to hand Jesus over to them."},{"num":5,"verse":"The priests were very happy about this. They promised to give Judas money for doing this."},{"num":6,"verse":"He agreed. Then he waited for the best time to hand him over to them. He wanted to do it when no one was around to see it."},{"header":"The Passover Meal(C)"},{"num":7,"verse":"The Day of Unleavened Bread came. This was the day when the Jews always killed the lambs for the Passover."},{"num":8,"verse":"Jesus said to Peter and John, “Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare the meal?”"},{"num":10,"verse":"“When you go into the city, you will see a man carrying a jar of water.

Jesus and the apostles were together at the table."},{"num":15,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “I wanted very much to eat this Passover meal with you before I die."},{"num":16,"verse":"I will never eat another Passover meal until it is given its full meaning in God’s kingdom.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"Then Jesus took a cup of wine. He gave thanks to God for it and said, “Take this cup and give it to everyone here."},{"num":18,"verse":"I will never drink wine again until God’s kingdom comes.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"Then he took some bread and thanked God for it.

I will even die with you!”"},{"num":34,"verse":"But Jesus said, “Peter, before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will say you don’t know me. You will say this three times.”"},{"header":"Be Ready for Trouble"},{"num":35,"verse":"Then Jesus said to the apostles, “Remember when I sent you out without money, a bag, or sandals? Did you need anything?”"},{"num":36,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “But now if you have money or a bag, carry that with you. If you don’t have a sword, sell your coat and buy one."},{"num":37,"verse":"The Scriptures say,"},{"num":38,"verse":"The followers said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.”"},{"header":"Jesus Prays Alone(G)"},{"num":39,"verse":"Jesus left the city and went to the Mount of Olives.

He said, “Lady, I don’t know him.”"},{"num":58,"verse":"A short time later, someone else saw Peter and said, “You are also one of them.”"},{"num":59,"verse":"About an hour later, another man said, “It’s true. I’m sure this man was with him, because he is from Galilee.”"},{"num":60,"verse":"But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!”"},{"num":61,"verse":"Then the Lord turned and looked into Peter’s eyes.
