[{"num":22,"verse":"But the festival of Matzah, known as Pesach, was approaching; "},{"num":2,"verse":"and the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers began trying to find some way to get rid of Yeshua, because they were afraid of the people."},{"num":3,"verse":"At this point the Adversary went into Y’hudah from K’riot, who was one of the Twelve. "},{"num":4,"verse":"He approached the head cohanim and the Temple guard and discussed with them how he might turn Yeshua over to them. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They were pleased and offered to pay him money. "},{"num":6,"verse":"He agreed and began looking for a good opportunity to betray Yeshua without the people’s knowledge."},{"num":7,"verse":"Then came the day of matzah, on which the Passover lamb had to be killed. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Yeshua sent Kefa and Yochanan, instructing them, “Go and prepare our Seder, so we can eat.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"They asked him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?” "},{"num":10,"verse":"He told them, “As you’re going into the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters, "},{"num":11,"verse":"and say to its owner, ‘The Rabbi says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I am to eat the Pesach meal with my talmidim?” ’ "},{"num":12,"verse":"He will show you a large room upstairs already furnished; make the preparations there.” "},{"num":13,"verse":"They went and found things just as Yeshua had told them they would be, and they prepared for the Seder."},{"num":14,"verse":"When the time came, Yeshua and the emissaries reclined at the table, "},{"num":15,"verse":"and he said to them, “I have really wanted so much to celebrate this Seder with you before I die! "},{"num":16,"verse":"For I tell you, it is certain that I will not celebrate it again until it is given its full meaning in the Kingdom of God.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"Then, taking a cup of wine, he made the b’rakhah and said, “Take this and share it among yourselves.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"But Yeshua said to them, “The kings of the Goyim lord it over them; and those in authority over them are given the title, ‘Benefactor.’ "},{"num":26,"verse":"But not so with you! On the contrary, let the greater among you become like the younger, and one who rules like one who serves. "},{"num":27,"verse":"For who is greater? The one reclining at the table? or the one who serves? It’s the one reclining at the table, isn’t it?

The Adversary demanded to have you people for himself, to sift you like wheat! "},{"num":32,"verse":"But I prayed for you, Shim‘on, that your trust might not fail.

Get up and pray that you won’t be put to the test!”"},{"num":47,"verse":"While he was still speaking, a crowd of people arrived, with the man called Y’hudah (one of the Twelve!) leading them.

They beat him, "},{"num":64,"verse":"blindfolded him, and kept asking him, “Now, ‘prophesy’! Who hit you that time?” "},{"num":65,"verse":"And they said many other insulting things to him."},{"num":66,"verse":"At daybreak, the people’s council of elders, including both head cohanim and Torah-teachers, met and led him off to their Sanhedrin, "},{"num":67,"verse":"where they said, “If you are the Mashiach, tell us.” He answered, “If I tell you, you won’t believe me; "},{"num":68,"verse":"and if I ask you, you won’t answer.
