"},{"num":5,"verse":"They were pleased and agreed to pay him money. "},{"num":6,"verse":"He accepted their offer and sought a favorable opportunity to hand him over to them in the absence of a crowd."},{"num":7,"verse":"When the day of the feast of Unleavened Bread arrived, the day for sacrificing the Passover lamb, "},{"num":8,"verse":"he sent out Peter and John, instructing them, “Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"They asked him, “Where do you want us to make the preparations?” "},{"num":10,"verse":"And he answered them, “When you go into the city, a man will meet you carrying a jar of water.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"He said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them and those in authority over them are addressed as ‘Benefactors’; "},{"num":26,"verse":"but among you it shall not be so.
