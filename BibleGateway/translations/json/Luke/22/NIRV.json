"},{"num":3,"verse":"Then Satan entered Judas, who was called Iscariot. Judas was one of the 12 disciples. "},{"num":4,"verse":"He went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard. He talked with them about how he could hand Jesus over to them. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They were delighted and agreed to give him money. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Judas accepted their offer. He watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them. He wanted to do it when no crowd was around."},{"header":"The Last Supper"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then the day of Unleavened Bread came. That was the time the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles hold power over their people. And those who order them around call themselves Protectors.
