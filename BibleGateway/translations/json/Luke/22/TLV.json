[{"header":"The Day before Pesach"},{"num":22,"verse":"Now the Feast of Matzah, which is called Passover, was approaching. "},{"num":2,"verse":"The ruling kohanim and Torah scholars were searching for a way to do away with Yeshua, for they were afraid of the people."},{"num":3,"verse":"Then satan entered into Judah, the one from Kriot, one of the twelve. "},{"num":4,"verse":"And he went away and talked with the ruling kohanim and officers of the Temple guard about how he might deliver Yeshua over to them. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They were delighted and agreed to give him money. "},{"num":6,"verse":"So he agreed and began looking for a chance to hand Yeshua over to them without a crowd."},{"num":7,"verse":"Then came the day of matzah when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Now Yeshua sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, so we may eat.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Then they said to Him, “Where do You want us to prepare?”"},{"num":10,"verse":"And He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters. "},{"num":11,"verse":"And say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’ "},{"num":12,"verse":"And with that, he will show you a large upper room, fully furnished.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"And Yeshua said to them, “The kings of the nations have mastery over them, and those exercising authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ "},{"num":26,"verse":"But with you, it is not so. Rather, let the one who is greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.

And whoever does not own a sword must sell his cloak and buy one.
