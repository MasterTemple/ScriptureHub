"},{"num":12,"verse":"or if he asked for an egg would give him a scorpion?

You pay your tithes of mint and rue and every garden herb, but you ignore justice and the love of God. You have an obligation to do these things — but without disregarding the others!"},{"num":43,"verse":"“Woe to you P’rushim, because you love the best seat in the synagogues and being greeted deferentially in the marketplaces!"},{"num":44,"verse":"“Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it.”"},{"num":45,"verse":"One of the experts in Torah answered him, “Rabbi, by saying these things you are insulting us also.” "},{"num":46,"verse":"Yeshua said, “Woe to you Torah experts too!
