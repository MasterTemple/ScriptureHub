The door is already locked, and my children are here with us in the bedroom. I can’t get up and give you anything!’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"I tell you, even though that man doesn’t want to get up and give him anything because he is his friend, he will get up and give him whatever he needs because of his persistence."},{"header":"Ask, Search, Knock(B)"},{"num":9,"verse":"So I say to you: Keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the door will be opened for you, "},{"num":10,"verse":"because everyone who keeps asking will receive, and the person who keeps searching will find, and the person who keeps knocking will have the door opened. "},{"num":11,"verse":"What father among you, if his son asks for bread, would give him a stone, or if he asks for a fish, would give him a snake instead of the fish? "},{"num":12,"verse":"Or if he asks for an egg, would he give him a scorpion?
