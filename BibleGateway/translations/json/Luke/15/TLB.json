[{"num":15,"verse":"Dishonest tax collectors and other notorious sinners often came to listen to Jesus’ sermons; "},{"num":2,"verse":"but this caused complaints from the Jewish religious leaders and the experts on Jewish law because he was associating with such despicable people—even eating with them!"},{"num":3,"verse":"So Jesus used this illustration: “If you had a hundred sheep and one of them strayed away and was lost in the wilderness, wouldn’t you leave the ninety-nine others to go and search for the lost one until you found it? "},{"num":5,"verse":"And then you would joyfully carry it home on your shoulders. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When you arrived you would call together your friends and neighbors to rejoice with you because your lost sheep was found."},{"num":7,"verse":"“Well, in the same way heaven will be happier over one lost sinner who returns to God than over ninety-nine others who haven’t strayed away!"},{"num":8,"verse":"“Or take another illustration: A woman has ten valuable silver coins and loses one. Won’t she light a lamp and look in every corner of the house and sweep every nook and cranny until she finds it?

"},{"num":10,"verse":"In the same way there is joy in the presence of the angels of God when one sinner repents.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"To further illustrate the point, he told them this story: “A man had two sons. "},{"num":12,"verse":"When the younger told his father, ‘I want my share of your estate now, instead of waiting until you die!’ his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons."},{"num":13,"verse":"“A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and took a trip to a distant land, and there wasted all his money on parties and prostitutes. "},{"num":14,"verse":"About the time his money was gone a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. "},{"num":15,"verse":"He persuaded a local farmer to hire him to feed his pigs.

And no one gave him anything."},{"num":17,"verse":"“When he finally came to his senses, he said to himself, ‘At home even the hired men have food enough and to spare, and here I am, dying of hunger! "},{"num":18,"verse":"I will go home to my father and say, “Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, "},{"num":19,"verse":"and am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired man.”’"},{"num":20,"verse":"“So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long distance away, his father saw him coming, and was filled with loving pity and ran and embraced him and kissed him."},{"num":21,"verse":"“His son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and you, and am not worthy of being called your son—’"},{"num":22,"verse":"“But his father said to the slaves, ‘Quick!
