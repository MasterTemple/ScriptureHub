[{"header":"The Lost Sheep(A)"},{"num":15,"verse":"One day when many tax collectors and other outcasts came to listen to Jesus, "},{"num":2,"verse":"the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law started grumbling, “This man welcomes outcasts and even eats with them!” "},{"num":3,"verse":"So Jesus told them this parable:"},{"num":4,"verse":"“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them—what do you do? You leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the pasture and go looking for the one that got lost until you find it. "},{"num":5,"verse":"When you find it, you are so happy that you put it on your shoulders "},{"num":6,"verse":"and carry it back home. Then you call your friends and neighbors together and say to them, ‘I am so happy I found my lost sheep. Let us celebrate!’ "},{"num":7,"verse":"In the same way, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine respectable people who do not need to repent."},{"header":"The Lost Coin"},{"num":8,"verse":"“Or suppose a woman who has ten silver coins loses one of them—what does she do? She lights a lamp, sweeps her house, and looks carefully everywhere until she finds it.

Let us celebrate!’ "},{"num":10,"verse":"In the same way, I tell you, the angels of God rejoice over one sinner who repents.”"},{"header":"The Lost Son"},{"num":11,"verse":"Jesus went on to say, “There was once a man who had two sons. "},{"num":12,"verse":"The younger one said to him, ‘Father, give me my share of the property now.’ So the man divided his property between his two sons. "},{"num":13,"verse":"After a few days the younger son sold his part of the property and left home with the money. He went to a country far away, where he wasted his money in reckless living. "},{"num":14,"verse":"He spent everything he had. Then a severe famine spread over that country, and he was left without a thing. "},{"num":15,"verse":"So he went to work for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him out to his farm to take care of the pigs. "},{"num":16,"verse":"He wished he could fill himself with the bean pods the pigs ate, but no one gave him anything to eat. "},{"num":17,"verse":"At last he came to his senses and said, ‘All my father's hired workers have more than they can eat, and here I am about to starve! "},{"num":18,"verse":"I will get up and go to my father and say, “Father, I have sinned against God and against you. "},{"num":19,"verse":"I am no longer fit to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired workers.”’ "},{"num":20,"verse":"So he got up and started back to his father."},{"num":21,"verse":"‘Father,’ the son said, ‘I have sinned against God and against you. I am no longer fit to be called your son.’ "},{"num":22,"verse":"But the father called to his servants. ‘Hurry!’ he said. ‘Bring the best robe and put it on him.

"},{"num":29,"verse":"But he spoke back to his father, ‘Look, all these years I have worked for you like a slave, and I have never disobeyed your orders. What have you given me? Not even a goat for me to have a feast with my friends!
