[{"num":5,"verse":"The people came close around Jesus to hear God's word. He was standing by Lake Gennesaret [the Sea of Galilee]."},{"num":2,"verse":"He saw two boats by the water. The fishermen were not in their boats. They were washing their nets."},{"num":3,"verse":"Jesus got into one of the boats. It was Simon's boat. Jesus asked him to put the boat out into the water a little way from the land. Then he sat down in the boat and taught the people."},{"num":4,"verse":"When he stopped talking, he said to Simon, `Put the boat out into deep water and let down your nets to catch some fish.'"},{"num":5,"verse":"Simon answered, `Master, we worked hard all night and did not catch anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.'"},{"num":6,"verse":"When they did this, they caught many fish. Their nets were so full they were breaking."},{"num":7,"verse":"They called their friends in the other boat to come and help them. They came. They filled both boats with so much fish, they began to go down."},{"num":8,"verse":"When Simon Peter saw this, he kneeled down in front of Jesus. He said, `Lord, leave me because I am a bad man!'"},{"num":9,"verse":"He was very much surprised to see how many fish they had caught. All those who were with him were surprised too."},{"num":10,"verse":"James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were helping Simon. They were surprised also. Jesus said to Simon, `Do not fear. From now on your work will be to catch men.'"},{"num":11,"verse":"They brought their boats to the land. Then they left everything and went with Jesus."},{"num":12,"verse":"Jesus was in one of the cities and a man was there who had leprosy, a bad skin disease. When he saw Jesus, he bowed his face to the ground. He begged Jesus saying, `Sir, I know you can heal me if you want to.'"},{"num":13,"verse":"Jesus put out his hand and touched the man. He said, `I want you to be healed.' Right away the man was free from leprosy."},{"num":14,"verse":"Jesus said to him, `Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you.

And many people gathered to hear him, and so be healed."},{"num":16,"verse":"Many times Jesus went away to the desert and talked with God."},{"num":17,"verse":"One day Jesus was teaching people.

They tried to bring him in and put him in front of Jesus."},{"num":19,"verse":"But they could not get in the house where Jesus was, because there were so many people. So they went up on the roof. Then through a hole in the roof they let down the bed with the sick man on it, until he was in front of Jesus."},{"num":20,"verse":"Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to him, `Man, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.'"},{"num":21,"verse":"The scribes and Pharisees began to talk about this. They said, `Who is this man that is not giving respect to God? No one but God can forgive anyone for the wrong things they have done.'"},{"num":22,"verse":"Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, `Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts?"},{"num":23,"verse":"Which is easier, to say, \"The wrong things you have done are forgiven,\" or to say, \"Get up and walk\"?"},{"num":24,"verse":"I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive wrong things people have done.' So he said to the sick man, `I tell you, get up. Take up your bed and go home.'"},{"num":25,"verse":"Right away the man stood up in front of them. He took up his bed and went home praising God."},{"num":26,"verse":"The people were all surprised and they praised God. They did not know what to think.

Many tax collectors and other people were sitting at the table with them."},{"num":30,"verse":"The Pharisees and their scribes did not like what Jesus' disciples did. They said, `Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and bad people?\""},{"num":31,"verse":"Jesus answered them, `People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him."},{"num":32,"verse":"I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.'"},{"num":33,"verse":"They said to him, `The disciples or followers of John are often fasting [not eating for a time], and they talk with God. The disciples of the Pharisees do the same. But your disciples eat and drink.'"},{"num":34,"verse":"Then Jesus said to them, `The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them."},{"num":35,"verse":"But the time will come when he will be taken away from them. Then they will be fasting at that time.'"},{"num":36,"verse":"Jesus told them a short story. He said, `No one takes a piece from a new coat and sews it on an old coat. If he does, the new coat will have a hole. And the new piece will not be like the old coat."},{"num":37,"verse":"No one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will break the skins. The wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled."},{"num":38,"verse":"New wine must be put into new skins."},{"num":39,"verse":"No one wants to drink new wine after he has had old wine. He says, \"The old is better.\" '"}]
