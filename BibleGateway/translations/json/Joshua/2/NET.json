Israelite men have come here tonight to spy on the land.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So the king of Jericho sent this order to Rahab: “Turn over the men who came to you—the ones who came to your house—for they have come to spy on the whole land!” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But the woman hid the two men and replied, “Yes, these men were clients of mine, but I didn’t know where they came from.
