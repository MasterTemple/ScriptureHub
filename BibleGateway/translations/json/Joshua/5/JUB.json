[{"num":5,"verse":"¶ And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the sons of Israel until we had passed, that their heart melted, and there was no more spirit in them before the sons of Israel."},{"num":2,"verse":"At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time."},{"num":3,"verse":"And Joshua made himself sharp knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins."},{"num":4,"verse":"And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people that had come out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, had died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt."},{"num":5,"verse":"Now all the people that had come out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt, were not circumcised."},{"num":6,"verse":"For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the people that were men of war, who had come out of Egypt, were consumed because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD; therefore, the LORD swore unto them that he would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey."},{"num":7,"verse":"But their sons, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised by the way."},{"num":8,"verse":"And when they had finished circumcising all the people, they abode in the same place in the camp until they were whole."},{"num":9,"verse":"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.

And Joshua went unto him and said unto him, Art thou one of us or one of our adversaries?"},{"num":14,"verse":"And he said, No, but I am the Prince of the host of the LORD; now I am come. Then Joshua falling upon his face in the earth worshipped him and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his slave?"},{"num":15,"verse":"And the Prince of the LORD’s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place on which thou dost stand is holy.
