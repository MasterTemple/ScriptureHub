spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take unto you for a prey: thou shalt lie in wait against the city on the back side thereof."},{"num":3,"verse":"¶ Then Joshua arose, and all the men of war to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand strong men, and valiant, and sent them away by night."},{"num":4,"verse":"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait

of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua."},{"num":24,"verse":"And when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, that is, in the wilderness where they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword."},{"num":25,"verse":"And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai."},{"num":26,"verse":"For Joshua drew not his hand back again which he had stretched out with the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."},{"num":27,"verse":"Only the cattle and the spoil of this city, Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the Lord, which he
