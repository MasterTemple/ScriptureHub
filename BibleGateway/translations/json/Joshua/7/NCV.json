[{"header":"The Sin of Achan"},{"num":7,"verse":"But the Israelites did not obey the Lord. There was a man from the tribe of Judah named Achan. (He was the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi, who was the son of Zerah.) Because Achan kept some of the things that were to be given to the Lord, the Lord became very angry at the Israelites."},{"num":2,"verse":"Joshua sent some men from Jericho to Ai, which was near Beth Aven, east of Bethel. He told them, “Go to Ai and spy out the area.” So the men went to spy on Ai."},{"num":3,"verse":"Later they came back to Joshua and said, “There are only a few people in Ai, so we will not need all our people to defeat them. Send only two or three thousand men to fight. There is no need to send all of our people.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"So about three thousand men went up to Ai, but the people of Ai beat them badly. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The people of Ai killed about thirty-six Israelites and then chased the rest from the city gate all the way down to the canyon, killing them as they went down the hill. When the Israelites saw this, they lost their courage."},{"num":6,"verse":"Then Joshua tore his clothes in sorrow. He bowed facedown on the ground before the Ark of the Lord and stayed there until evening. The leaders of Israel did the same thing. They also threw dirt on their heads to show their sorrow.

We would have been happy to stay on the other side of the Jordan. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Lord, there is nothing I can say now. Israel has been beaten by the enemy. "},{"num":9,"verse":"The Canaanites and all the other people in this country will hear about this and will surround and kill us all!

"},{"num":11,"verse":"The Israelites have sinned; they have broken the agreement I commanded them to obey. They took some of the things I commanded them to destroy. They have stolen and lied and have taken those things for themselves. "},{"num":12,"verse":"That is why the Israelites cannot face their enemies. They turn away from the fight and run, because I have commanded that they be destroyed. I will not help you anymore unless you destroy everything as I commanded you."},{"num":13,"verse":"“Now go! Make the people holy. Tell them, ‘Set yourselves apart to the Lord for tomorrow. The Lord, the God of Israel, says some of you are keeping things he commanded you to destroy.

Then the Lord will choose one family from that family group to stand before him, person by person.

I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I did: "},{"num":21,"verse":"Among the things I saw was a beautiful coat from Babylonia and about five pounds of silver and more than one and one-fourth pounds of gold. I wanted these things very much for myself, so I took them.
