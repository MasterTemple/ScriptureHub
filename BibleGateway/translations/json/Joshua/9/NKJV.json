[{"header":"The Treaty with the Gibeonites"},{"num":9,"verse":"And it came to pass when all the kings who were on this side of the Jordan, in the hills and in the lowland and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Lebanon—the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite—heard about it, "},{"num":2,"verse":"that they gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one accord."},{"num":3,"verse":"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, "},{"num":4,"verse":"they worked craftily, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and mended, "},{"num":5,"verse":"old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And they went to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell among us; so how can we make a covenant with you?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"But they said to Joshua, “We are your servants.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So they said to him: “From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the Lord your God; for we have heard of His fame, and all that He did in Egypt, "},{"num":10,"verse":"and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan—to Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; now therefore, make a covenant with us.” ’ "},{"num":12,"verse":"This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you.
