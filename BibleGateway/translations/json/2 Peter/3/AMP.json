For ever since the fathers fell asleep [in death], all things have continued [exactly] as they did from the beginning of creation.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"For they willingly forget [the fact] that the heavens existed long ago by the word of God, and the earth was formed out of water and by water, "},{"num":6,"verse":"through which the world at that time was destroyed by being flooded with water.
