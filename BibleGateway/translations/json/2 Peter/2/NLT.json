[{"header":"The Danger of False Teachers"},{"num":2,"verse":"But there were also false prophets in Israel, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will cleverly teach destructive heresies and even deny the Master who bought them. In this way, they will bring sudden destruction on themselves."},{"num":2,"verse":"Many will follow their evil teaching and shameful immorality. And because of these teachers, the way of truth will be slandered."},{"num":3,"verse":"In their greed they will make up clever lies to get hold of your money. But God condemned them long ago, and their destruction will not be delayed."},{"num":4,"verse":"For God did not spare even the angels who sinned. He threw them into hell, in gloomy pits of darkness, where they are being held until the day of judgment."},{"num":5,"verse":"And God did not spare the ancient world—except for Noah and the seven others in his family. Noah warned the world of God’s righteous judgment.

They scoff at things they do not understand, and like animals, they will be destroyed."},{"num":13,"verse":"Their destruction is their reward for the harm they have done. They love to indulge in evil pleasures in broad daylight. They are a disgrace and a stain among you. They delight in deception even as they eat with you in your fellowship meals."},{"num":14,"verse":"They commit adultery with their eyes, and their desire for sin is never satisfied. They lure unstable people into sin, and they are well trained in greed.

They are doomed to blackest darkness."},{"num":18,"verse":"They brag about themselves with empty, foolish boasting. With an appeal to twisted sexual desires, they lure back into sin those who have barely escaped from a lifestyle of deception."},{"num":19,"verse":"They promise freedom, but they themselves are slaves of sin and corruption.
