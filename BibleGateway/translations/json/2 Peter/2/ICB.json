[{"header":"False Teachers"},{"num":2,"verse":"There used to be false prophets among God’s people, just as there are now. And you will have some false teachers in your group.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"They have caused many people to suffer; so they themselves will suffer. That is their pay for what they have done. They take pleasure in doing evil things openly.
