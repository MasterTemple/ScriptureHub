[{"num":9,"verse":"And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. "},{"num":10,"verse":"And a manâ€™s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the Lord."}]
