[{"num":6,"verse":"Woe to those who are at ease in Zion,"},{"num":10,"verse":"“When a man’s relative carries him, even he who burns him, to bring bodies out of the house, and asks him who is in the innermost parts of the house, ‘Is there yet any with you?’ And he says, ‘No;’ then he will say, ‘Hush! Indeed we must not mention Yahweh’s name.’"}]
