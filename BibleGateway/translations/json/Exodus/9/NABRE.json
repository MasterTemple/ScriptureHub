"},{"num":4,"verse":"But the Lord will distinguish between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that nothing belonging to the Israelites will die. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And the Lord set a definite time, saying: Tomorrow the Lord will do this in the land. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And on the next day the Lord did it. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But although Pharaoh found upon inquiry that not even so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites had died, he remained obstinate and would not let the people go."},{"num":8,"verse":"Sixth Plague: The Boils.
