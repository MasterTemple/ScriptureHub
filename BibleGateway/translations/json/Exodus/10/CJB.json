[{"num":10,"verse":"Adonai said to Moshe, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have made him and his servants hardhearted, so that I can demonstrate these signs of mine among them, "},{"num":2,"verse":"so that you can tell your son and grandson about what I did to Egypt and about my signs that I demonstrated among them, and so that you will all know that I am Adonai.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"Moshe and Aharon went in to Pharaoh and said to him, “Here is what Adonai, God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How much longer will you refuse to submit to me? Let my people go, so that they can worship me. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Otherwise, if you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory. "},{"num":5,"verse":"One won’t be able to see the ground, so completely will the locusts cover it. They will eat anything you still have that escaped the hail, including every tree you have growing in the field.

It will be like nothing your fathers or their fathers have ever seen since the day they were born until today.’” Then he turned his back and left."},{"num":7,"verse":"Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How much longer must this fellow be a snare for us? Let the people go and worship Adonai their God.

"},{"num":15,"verse":"They completely covered the ground, so that the ground looked black. They ate every plant growing from the ground and all the fruit of the trees left by the hail. Not one green thing remained, not a tree and not a plant in the field, in all the land of Egypt."},{"num":16,"verse":"Pharaoh hurried to summon Moshe and Aharon and said, “I have sinned against Adonai your God and against you.
