The wilderness has closed in on them.’ Then I’ll make Pharaoh’s heart stubborn again and he’ll chase after them. And I’ll use Pharaoh and his army to put my Glory on display. Then the Egyptians will realize that I am God.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"When the king of Egypt was told that the people were gone, he and his servants changed their minds. They said, “What have we done, letting Israel, our slave labor, go free?” So he had his chariots harnessed up and got his army together. He took six hundred of his best chariots, with the rest of the Egyptian chariots and their drivers coming along."},{"num":8,"verse":"God made Pharaoh king of Egypt stubborn, determined to chase the Israelites as they walked out on him without even looking back. The Egyptians gave chase and caught up with them where they had made camp by the sea—all Pharaoh’s horse-drawn chariots and their riders, all his foot soldiers there at Pi Hahiroth opposite Baal Zephon."},{"num":10,"verse":"As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw them—Egyptians!

And the Pillar of Cloud that had been in front also shifted to the rear. The Cloud was now between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel.

The two camps didn’t come near each other all night."},{"num":21,"verse":"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and God, with a terrific east wind all night long, made the sea go back. He made the sea dry ground. The seawaters split."},{"num":22,"verse":"The Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground with the waters a wall to the right and to the left. The Egyptians came after them in full pursuit, every horse and chariot and driver of Pharaoh racing into the middle of the sea. It was now the morning watch.

He clogged the wheels of their chariots; they were stuck in the mud."},{"num":26,"verse":"God said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea and the waters will come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots, over their horsemen.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"Moses stretched his hand out over the sea: As the day broke and the Egyptians were running, the sea returned to its place as before.

Not one of them survived."},{"num":29,"verse":"But the Israelites walked right through the middle of the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall to the right and to the left.

The people were in reverent awe before God and trusted in God and his servant Moses."}]
