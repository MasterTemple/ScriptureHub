The wilderness has closed in on them.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"I will so harden Pharaoh’s heart that he will pursue them. Thus I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord."},{"num":5,"verse":"When it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart about the people. “What in the world have we done!” they said. “We have released Israel from our service!” "},{"num":6,"verse":"So Pharaoh harnessed his chariots and took his army with him. "},{"num":7,"verse":"He took six hundred select chariots and all the chariots of Egypt, with officers on all of them.

Now Pharaoh was near when the Israelites looked up and saw that the Egyptians had set out after them. Greatly frightened, the Israelites cried out to the Lord.

"},{"num":12,"verse":"Did we not tell you this in Egypt, when we said, ‘Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? Far better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.” "},{"num":13,"verse":"But Moses answered the people, “Do not fear! Stand your ground and see the victory the Lord will win for you today. For these Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again.

And the column of cloud, moving from in front of them, took up its place behind them, "},{"num":20,"verse":"so that it came between the Egyptian army and that of Israel. And when it became dark, the cloud illumined the night; and so the rival camps did not come any closer together all night long.
