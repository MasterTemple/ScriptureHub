"},{"num":3,"verse":"Instruct those to whom I have given special skill as tailors to make the garments that will set him apart from others, so that he may minister to me in the priest’s office. "},{"num":4,"verse":"This is the wardrobe they shall make: a chestpiece, an ephod, a robe, an embroidered shirt, a turban, and a sash. They shall also make special garments for Aaron’s sons."},{"num":5,"verse":"“The ephod shall be made by the most skilled of the workmen, using gold, blue, purple, and scarlet threads of fine linen. "},{"num":7,"verse":"It will consist of two pieces, front and back, joined at the shoulders. "},{"num":8,"verse":"And the sash shall be made of the same material—threads of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet fine-twined linen. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the tribes of Israel. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Six names shall be on each stone, so that all the tribes are named in the order of their births.
