When the people saw it, they exclaimed, “O Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt!”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Aaron saw how excited the people were, so he built an altar in front of the calf. Then he announced, “Tomorrow will be a festival to the Lord!”"},{"num":6,"verse":"The people got up early the next morning to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings.
