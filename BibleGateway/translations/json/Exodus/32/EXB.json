[{"header":"The People Make a Gold Calf"},{"num":32,"verse":"The people saw that ·a long time had passed and Moses had not [Moses delayed to] come down from the mountain. So they ·gathered [assembled] ·around [or against] Aaron and said, “[This man] Moses ·led [brought] us out of Egypt, but we don’t know what has happened to him. Make us ·gods [or a god; or an image of God] who will ·lead [go before] us.”"},{"num":2,"verse":"Aaron said to ·the people [them], “·Take [Pull] off the gold earrings that your wives, sons, and daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"So all the people ·took [pulled off] their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron. "},{"num":4,"verse":"He took ·the gold [it] from ·the people [their hands] and formed it ·with a tool [or in a mold] and made a ·statue [image] of a calf. Then the people said, “Israel, ·these are your gods [or this is your God; either an idol to a false god or an inappropriate image for a false worship of the true God] who brought you out of the land of Egypt [1 Kin. 12:28]!”"},{"num":5,"verse":"When Aaron saw all this, he built an altar before the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a ·special feast to honor [festival for] the Lord.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"The people got up early the next morning and offered whole burnt offerings [Lev. 1] and ·fellowship [or peace] offerings [Lev. 3]. They sat down to eat and drink, and then they ·got up and sinned sexually [got up and amused themselves; rose up to play; a euphemism]."},{"num":7,"verse":"Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go down from this mountain, because your people, the people you brought out of the land of Egypt, have ·ruined themselves [acted in a debauched/perverse manner]. "},{"num":8,"verse":"They have quickly turned away from the ·things [path; way] I commanded them to do. They have made for themselves a calf ·covered with gold [image], and they have worshiped it and offered sacrifices to it. They have said, ‘Israel, ·these are your gods [or this is the God; 32:4] who brought you out of Egypt.’”"},{"num":9,"verse":"The Lord said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and I know that they are ·very stubborn [a stiff-necked people]. "},{"num":10,"verse":"So now do not stop me. I am so angry with them that I am going to ·destroy [consume] them. Then I will make ·you and your descendants [you] a great nation [echoing the promise to Abraham; Gen. 12:1–3].”"},{"num":11,"verse":"But Moses ·begged [tried to appease] the Lord his God and said, “Lord, ·don’t let your anger destroy [why does your anger burn against…?] your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with your great power and ·strength [a mighty hand]. "},{"num":12,"verse":"·Don’t let [Why should…?] the people of Egypt say, ‘The Lord brought the Israelites out of Egypt for an evil purpose. He planned to kill them in the mountains and ·destroy [wipe] them from the earth.’ So ·stop being angry [change your mind; relent], and don’t ·destroy [bring harm on] your people. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Remember ·the men who served you [your servants]—Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. You promised with an oath to them and said, ‘I will make your ·descendants [seed] as many as the stars in the sky [Gen. 15:5; 22:17; 26:4]. I will give your descendants all this land that I have promised them, and ·it will be theirs [they will inherit it] forever [Gen. 12:1–3].’” "},{"num":14,"verse":"So the Lord ·changed his mind [relented] and did not ·destroy [bring harm on] the people as he had said he might."},{"num":15,"verse":"Then Moses went down the mountain, and in his hands he had the two stone tablets with the ·Agreement [Covenant; Testimony; Treaty] on them.

He threw down the stone tablets that he was carrying and broke them at the bottom of the mountain [signifying the broken covenant]. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Then he took the calf that they had made and melted it in the fire. He ground it into powder. Then he ·threw [scattered] the powder into the water and forced the Israelites to drink it [paralleling an ancient Near Eastern ritual for destroying a statue of a god]."},{"num":21,"verse":"Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you? Why did you ·cause them to do [bring on them] such a terrible sin?”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Aaron answered, “Don’t be angry, ·master [sir]. You know that these people are always ready to do wrong.

Make us ·gods [or a god; or an image of God] who will ·lead [go before] us.’ "},{"num":24,"verse":"So I told them. ‘·Take off your gold jewelry [Whoever has gold, pull it off].’ When they gave it to me, I threw it into the fire and out ·came [popped] this calf!”"},{"num":25,"verse":"Moses saw that the people were ·acting wildly [out of control]. Aaron had let them ·get out of control [act wildly] and become ·fools [the object of slander] in front of their enemies. "},{"num":26,"verse":"So Moses stood at the ·entrance [gate] to the camp and said, “·Let anyone who wants to follow [Whoever is for] the Lord come to me.” And all the ·people from the family of [sons of] Levi gathered around Moses."},{"num":27,"verse":"Then Moses said to them, “The Lord, the God of Israel, says this: ‘Every man must put on his sword and go through the camp from ·one end to the other [gate to gate]. Each man must kill his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.’” "},{"num":28,"verse":"The ·people from the family [sons] of Levi obeyed Moses, and that day about three thousand of the Israelites died.

You were willing to kill your own sons and brothers, and God has blessed you for this.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"The next day Moses told the people, “You have ·done [sinned] a terrible sin. But now I will go up to the Lord. Maybe I can ·do something so your sins will be removed [make atonement for your sin].” "},{"num":31,"verse":"So Moses went back to the Lord and said, “How terribly these people have sinned! They have made for themselves ·gods [or a god; 32:4] from gold. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Now, please forgive them of this sin. If you will not, then ·erase [blot out] my name from the book in which you have written the names of your people.”"},{"num":33,"verse":"But the Lord told Moses, “I will ·erase [blot out] from my book the names of the people who sin against me.
