[{"header":"Chapter 32"},{"num":1,"verse":"The Golden Calf.

He flung down the tablets, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain."},{"num":20,"verse":"He then seized the calf that they had made and burned it with fire. He ground it down until it was a powder and scattered it on water that he made the children of Israel drink."},{"num":21,"verse":"The Zeal of the Levites.
