[{"header":"The Gold Calf(A)"},{"num":32,"verse":"Now when the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods that shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”"},{"num":2,"verse":"And Aaron said to them, “Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"So all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.

For your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves. "},{"num":8,"verse":"They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them.
