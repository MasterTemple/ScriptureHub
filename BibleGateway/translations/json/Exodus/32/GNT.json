"},{"num":4,"verse":"He took the earrings, melted them, poured the gold into a mold, and made a gold bull-calf."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then Aaron built an altar in front of the gold bull-calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to honor the Lord.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"Early the next morning they brought some animals to burn as sacrifices and others to eat as fellowship offerings. The people sat down to a feast, which turned into an orgy of drinking and sex."},{"num":7,"verse":"The Lord said to Moses, “Hurry and go back down, because your people, whom you led out of Egypt, have sinned and rejected me. "},{"num":8,"verse":"They have already left the way that I commanded them to follow; they have made a bull-calf out of melted gold and have worshiped it and offered sacrifices to it. They are saying that this is their god, who led them out of Egypt. "},{"num":9,"verse":"I know how stubborn these people are. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Now, don't try to stop me. I am angry with them, and I am going to destroy them. Then I will make you and your descendants into a great nation.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"But Moses pleaded with the Lord his God and said, “Lord, why should you be so angry with your people, whom you rescued from Egypt with great might and power?

"},{"num":21,"verse":"He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have made them commit such a terrible sin?”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Aaron answered, “Don't be angry with me; you know how determined these people are to do evil.

I threw the ornaments into the fire and out came this bull-calf!”"},{"num":25,"verse":"Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get out of control and make fools of themselves in front of their enemies.
