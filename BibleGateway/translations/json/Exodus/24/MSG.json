[{"num":1,"verse":"He said to Moses, “Climb the mountain to God, you and Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. They will worship from a distance; only Moses will approach God. The rest are not to come close. And the people are not to climb the mountain at all.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"So Moses went to the people and told them everything God had said—all the rules and regulations. They all answered in unison: “Everything God said, we’ll do.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then Moses wrote it all down, everything God had said. He got up early the next morning and built an Altar at the foot of the mountain using twelve pillar-stones for the twelve tribes of Israel. Then he directed young Israelite men to offer Whole-Burnt-Offerings and sacrifice Peace-Offerings of bulls. Moses took half the blood and put it in bowls; the other half he threw against the Altar."},{"num":7,"verse":"Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it as the people listened. They said, “Everything God said, we’ll do.

You have Aaron and Hur with you; if there are any problems, go to them.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"Then Moses climbed the mountain. The Cloud covered the mountain.
