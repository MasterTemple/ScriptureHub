Take the basket of them along with the bull and the two rams. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Aaron and his sons you shall also bring to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there wash them with water. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Take the vestments and clothe Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself, and the breastpiece, fastening the embroidered belt of the ephod around him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Put the turban on his head, the sacred diadem on the turban. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Then take the anointing oil and pour it on his head, and anoint him. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Bring forward his sons also and clothe them with the tunics, "},{"num":9,"verse":"gird them with the sashes, and tie the skullcaps on them. Thus shall the priesthood be theirs by a perpetual statute, and thus shall you install Aaron and his sons."},{"num":10,"verse":"Installation Sacrifices. Now bring forward the bull in front of the tent of meeting. There Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.

The blood you shall take and splash on all the sides of the altar. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Cut the ram into pieces; you shall wash its inner organs and shanks and put them with the pieces and with the head.

"},{"num":32,"verse":"At the entrance of the tent of meeting Aaron and his sons shall eat the meat of the ram and the bread that is in the basket. "},{"num":33,"verse":"They themselves are to eat of these things by which atonement was made at their installation and consecration; but no unauthorized person may eat of them, since they are sacred.

Seven days you shall spend installing them, "},{"num":36,"verse":"sacrificing a bull each day as a purification offering, to make atonement. Thus you shall purify the altar by purging it, and you shall anoint it in order to consecrate it. "},{"num":37,"verse":"Seven days you shall spend in purging the altar and in consecrating it. Then the altar will be most sacred, and whatever touches it will become sacred."},{"num":38,"verse":"Now, this is what you shall regularly offer on the altar: two yearling lambs as the sacrifice established for each day; "},{"num":39,"verse":"one lamb in the morning and the other lamb at the evening twilight.
