[{"header":"Instructions for the Passover"},{"num":12,"verse":"The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: "},{"num":2,"verse":"“This month is to be the beginning of months for you; it is the first month of your year.

"},{"num":4,"verse":"If the household is too small for a whole animal, that person and the neighbor nearest his house are to select one based on the combined number of people; you should apportion the animal according to what each person will eat. "},{"num":5,"verse":"You must have an unblemished animal, a year-old male; you may take it from either the sheep or the goats. "},{"num":6,"verse":"You are to keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight. "},{"num":7,"verse":"They must take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses where they eat them. "},{"num":8,"verse":"They are to eat the meat that night; they should eat it, roasted over the fire along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Do not eat any of it raw or cooked in boiling water, but only roasted over fire—its head as well as its legs and inner organs. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Do not let any of it remain until morning; you must burn up any part of it that does remain before morning. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Here is how you must eat it: you must be dressed for travel, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it in a hurry; it is the Lord’s Passover."},{"num":12,"verse":"“I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night and strike every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. I am Yahweh; I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. "},{"num":13,"verse":"The blood on the houses where you are staying will be a distinguishing mark for you; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will be among you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt."},{"num":14,"verse":"“This day is to be a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to the Lord. You are to celebrate it throughout your generations as a permanent statute. "},{"num":15,"verse":"You must eat unleavened bread for seven days.

"},{"num":22,"verse":"Take a cluster of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and brush the lintel and the two doorposts with some of the blood in the basin. None of you may go out the door of his house until morning. "},{"num":23,"verse":"When the Lord passes through to strike Egypt and sees the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, He will pass over the door and not let the destroyer enter your houses to strike you."},{"num":24,"verse":"“Keep this command permanently as a statute for you and your descendants.

"},{"num":28,"verse":"Then the Israelites went and did this; they did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron."},{"header":"The Exodus"},{"num":29,"verse":"Now at midnight the Lord struck every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and every firstborn of the livestock. "},{"num":30,"verse":"During the night Pharaoh got up, he along with all his officials and all the Egyptians, and there was a loud wailing throughout Egypt because there wasn’t a house without someone dead. "},{"num":31,"verse":"He summoned Moses and Aaron during the night and said, “Get up, leave my people, both you and the Israelites, and go, worship Yahweh as you have asked. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Take even your flocks and your herds as you asked and leave, and also bless me.”"},{"num":33,"verse":"Now the Egyptians pressured the people in order to send them quickly out of the country, for they said, “We’re all going to die!” "},{"num":34,"verse":"So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their clothes on their shoulders."},{"num":35,"verse":"The Israelites acted on Moses’ word and asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing. "},{"num":36,"verse":"And the Lord gave the people such favor in the Egyptians’ sight that they gave them what they requested. In this way they plundered the Egyptians."},{"num":37,"verse":"The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 soldiers on foot, besides their families. "},{"num":38,"verse":"An ethnically diverse crowd also went up with them, along with a huge number of livestock, both flocks and herds. "},{"num":39,"verse":"The people baked the dough they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened loaves, since it had no yeast; for when they had been driven out of Egypt they could not delay and had not prepared any provisions for themselves."},{"num":40,"verse":"The time that the Israelites lived in Egypt was 430 years. "},{"num":41,"verse":"At the end of 430 years, on that same day, all the Lord’s divisions went out from the land of Egypt.
