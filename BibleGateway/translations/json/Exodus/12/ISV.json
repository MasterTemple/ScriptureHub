"},{"num":4,"verse":"If a household is too small for a lamb, then it and its closest neighbor are to obtain one based on the number of individuals—dividing the lamb based on what each person can eat.

"},{"num":8,"verse":"That very night they’re to eat the meat, roasted over the fire, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Don’t eat any of it raw or boiled in water. Instead, roast it over the fire, with its head, legs, and internal organs.

You are to eat it hurriedly—it’s the Lord’s Passover. "},{"num":12,"verse":"I’ll pass through the land of Egypt that night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both people and animals. I’ll execute judgments on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord. "},{"num":13,"verse":"The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. I’ll see the blood and pass over you.

You are to celebrate it as a perpetual ordinance from generation to generation. "},{"num":15,"verse":"You are to eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the first day be sure to remove all the leaven from your houses, because any person who eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh will be cut off from Israel.

Moses and Aaron did just what the Lord had commanded."},{"header":"The Death of the Firstborn in Egypt"},{"num":29,"verse":"And so at midnight the Lord struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock. "},{"num":30,"verse":"Pharaoh got up during the night, he, all his officials, and all the Egyptians, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, because there was not a house without someone dead in it.

And bless me too!”"},{"num":33,"verse":"The Egyptian officials urged the people to send them out of the land quickly, because they were saying, “We’ll all be dead!” "},{"num":34,"verse":"So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulders. "},{"num":35,"verse":"Meanwhile, the Israelis had done as Moses said; they had asked the Egyptians for objects of silver and objects of gold, and for clothes. "},{"num":36,"verse":"The Lord had given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they gave them what they requested. As a result, they plundered the Egyptians."},{"header":"The Exodus Begins"},{"num":37,"verse":"About 600,000 Israeli men traveled from Rameses to Succoth on foot, not counting children.

It had not been leavened because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared provisions for themselves."},{"num":40,"verse":"Now the time that the Israelis lived in Egypt was 430 years.
