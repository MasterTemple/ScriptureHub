[{"num":5,"verse":"After this presentation to the elders, Moses and Aaron went to see Pharaoh. They told him, “We bring you a message from Jehovah, the God of Israel. He says, ‘Let my people go, for they must make a holy pilgrimage out into the wilderness, for a religious feast, to worship me there.’”"},{"num":2,"verse":"“Is that so?” retorted Pharaoh. “And who is Jehovah, that I should listen to him, and let Israel go? I don’t know Jehovah and I will not let Israel go.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"But Aaron and Moses persisted. “The God of the Hebrews has met with us,” they declared. “We must take a three days’ trip into the wilderness and sacrifice there to Jehovah our God; if we don’t obey him, we face death by plague or sword.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"“Who do you think you are,” Pharaoh shouted, “distracting the people from their work? Get back to your jobs!” "},{"num":6,"verse":"That same day Pharaoh sent this order to the taskmasters and officers he had set over the people of Israel: "},{"num":7,"verse":"“Don’t give the people any more straw for making bricks! However, don’t reduce their production quotas by a single brick, for they obviously don’t have enough to do or else they wouldn’t be talking about going out into the wilderness and sacrificing to their God. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Load them with work and make them sweat; that will teach them to listen to Moses’ and Aaron’s lies!”"},{"num":10,"verse":"So the taskmasters and officers informed the people: “Pharaoh has given orders to furnish you with no more straw. Go and find it wherever you can; but you must produce just as many bricks as before!” "},{"num":12,"verse":"So the people scattered everywhere to gather straw."},{"num":13,"verse":"The taskmasters were brutal. “Fulfill your daily quota just as before,” they kept demanding.

No straw will be given you, and you must deliver the regular quota of bricks.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"Then the foremen saw that they were indeed in a bad situation.
