"},{"num":3,"verse":"The Israelites said to them, “We wish the Lord had put us to death in Egypt. There we sat around pots of meat. We ate all the food we wanted. But you have brought us out into this desert. You must want this entire community to die of hunger.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the Lord spoke to Moses. He said, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people must go out each day. Have them gather enough bread for that day. Here is how I will test them. I will see if they will follow my directions. "},{"num":5,"verse":"On the sixth day they must prepare what they bring in. On that day they must gather twice as much as on the other days.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Moses and Aaron spoke to all the people of Israel. They said, “In the evening you will know that the Lord brought you out of Egypt. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord. He has heard you say you aren’t happy with him. Who are we? Why are you telling us you aren’t happy with us?” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Moses also said, “You will know that the Lord has heard you speak against him. He will give you meat to eat in the evening. He’ll give you all the bread you want in the morning. But who are we? You aren’t speaking against us.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"When the dew was gone, thin flakes appeared on the desert floor. They looked like frost on the ground. "},{"num":15,"verse":"The people of Israel saw the flakes. They asked each other, “What’s that?” They didn’t know what it was."},{"num":16,"verse":"Here is what the Lord has commanded. He has said, ‘Everyone should gather as much as they need. Take three pounds for each person who lives in your tent.’ ”"},{"num":17,"verse":"The people of Israel did as they were told. Some gathered a lot, and some gathered a little.

But by the hottest time of the day, the thin flakes had melted away. "},{"num":22,"verse":"On the sixth day, the people gathered twice as much. It amounted to six pounds for each person. The leaders of the community came and reported that to Moses. "},{"num":23,"verse":"He said to them, “Here is what the Lord commanded. He said, ‘Tomorrow will be a day of rest. It will be a holy Sabbath day. It will be set apart for the Lord. So bake what you want to bake. Boil what you want to boil. Save what is left. Keep it until morning.’ ”"},{"num":24,"verse":"So they saved it until morning, just as Moses commanded. It didn’t stink or get maggots in it.
