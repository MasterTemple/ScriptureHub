The whole company of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron there in the wilderness.

You’ve brought us out into this wilderness to starve us to death, the whole company of Israel!”"},{"num":4,"verse":"God said to Moses, “I’m going to rain bread down from the skies for you. The people will go out and gather each day’s ration. I’m going to test them to see if they’ll live according to my Teaching or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they have gathered, it will turn out to be twice as much as their daily ration.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Moses and Aaron told the People of Israel, “This evening you will know that it is God who brought you out of Egypt; and in the morning you will see the Glory of God. Yes, he’s listened to your complaints against him. You haven’t been complaining against us, you know, but against God.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Moses said, “Since it will be God who gives you meat for your meal in the evening and your fill of bread in the morning, it’s God who will have listened to your complaints against him.

When the layer of dew had lifted, there on the wilderness ground was a fine flaky something, fine as frost on the ground. The Israelites took one look and said to one another, man-hu (What is it?). They had no idea what it was."},{"num":15,"verse":"So Moses told them, “It’s the bread God has given you to eat. And these are God’s instructions: ‘Gather enough for each person, about two quarts per person; gather enough for everyone in your tent.’”"},{"num":17,"verse":"The People of Israel went to work and started gathering, some more, some less, but when they measured out what they had gathered, those who gathered more had no extra and those who gathered less weren’t short—each person had gathered as much as was needed."},{"num":19,"verse":"Moses said to them, “Don’t leave any of it until morning.”"},{"num":20,"verse":"But they didn’t listen to Moses.

On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, about four quarts per person."},{"num":23,"verse":"Moses said, “This is what God was talking about: Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to God. Whatever you plan to bake, bake today; and whatever you plan to boil, boil today. Then set aside the leftovers until morning.” They set aside what was left until morning, as Moses had commanded. It didn’t smell bad and there were no worms in it."},{"num":25,"verse":"Moses said, “Now eat it; this is the day, a Sabbath for God. You won’t find any of it on the ground today.
