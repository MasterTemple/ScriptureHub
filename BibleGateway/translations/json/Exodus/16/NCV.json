"},{"num":3,"verse":"They said to them, “It would have been better if the Lord had killed us in the land of Egypt. There we had meat to eat and all the food we wanted. But you have brought us into this desert to starve us to death.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the Lord said to Moses, “I will cause food to fall like rain from the sky for all of you. Every day the people must go out and gather what they need for that day. I want to see if the people will do what I teach them.

We are nothing, so you are not grumbling against us, but against the Lord.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"And Moses said, “Each evening the Lord will give you meat to eat, and every morning he will give you all the bread you want, because he has heard you grumble against him. You are not grumbling against Aaron and me, because we are nothing; you are grumbling against the Lord.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Moses said to Aaron, “Speak to the whole community of the Israelites, and say to them, ‘Meet together in the presence of the Lord, because he has heard your grumblings.’”"},{"num":10,"verse":"While Aaron was speaking to the whole community of the Israelites, they looked toward the desert.
