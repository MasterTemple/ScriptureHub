[{"header":"God Judges Sin"},{"num":2,"verse":"No matter who you are, before you judge the wickedness of others, you had better remember this: you are also without excuse, for you too are guilty of the same kind of things!

God is always right, because he has all the facts. "},{"num":3,"verse":"And no matter who you think you are, when you judge others who do these things and then do the same things yourself, what makes you think that you will escape God’s judgment?"},{"num":4,"verse":"Do the riches of his extraordinary kindness make you take him for granted and despise him?

For when they instinctively do what the law requires, that becomes a “law” to govern them, even though they don’t have Mosaic law.
