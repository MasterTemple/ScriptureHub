[{"header":"God will Judge Everyone"},{"num":2,"verse":"Therefore, you have no excuse—every one of you who judges. For when you pass judgment on another person, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, practice the very same things. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Now we know that God’s judgment against those who act like this is based on truth. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on those who practice these things and then do them yourself, do you think you will escape God’s judgment? "},{"num":4,"verse":"Or are you unaware of his rich kindness, forbearance, and patience, that it is God’s kindness that is leading you to repent?"},{"num":5,"verse":"But because of your stubborn and unrepentant heart you are reserving wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For he will repay everyone according to what that person has done: "},{"num":7,"verse":"eternal life to those who strive for glory, honor, and immortality by patiently doing good; "},{"num":8,"verse":"but wrath and fury for those who in their selfish pride refuse to believe the truth and practice wickedness instead.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"For it is not merely those who hear the Law who are righteous in God’s sight. No, it is those who follow the Law, who will be justified. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For whenever gentiles, who do not possess the Law, do instinctively what the Law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the Law. "},{"num":15,"verse":"They show that what the Law requires is written in their hearts, a fact to which their own consciences testify, and their thoughts will either accuse or excuse them "},{"num":16,"verse":"on that day when God, through Jesus the Messiah, will judge people’s secrets according to my gospel."},{"header":"Who is a Jew?"},{"num":17,"verse":"Now if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the Law, and boast about God, "},{"num":18,"verse":"and know his will, and approve of what is best because you have been instructed in the Law; "},{"num":19,"verse":"and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness, "},{"num":20,"verse":"an instructor of ignorant people, and a teacher of infants because you have the full content of knowledge and truth in the Law— "},{"num":21,"verse":"as you teach others, do you fail to teach yourself?
