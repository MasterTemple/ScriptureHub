[{"num":14,"verse":"Be ready to take a person into the church even if he does not know and believe all you believe. Do not judge what he thinks about things."},{"num":2,"verse":"One person believes he may eat anything. Another person, who does not believe that, eats only things that grow in the garden."},{"num":3,"verse":"The one who eats anything must not despise the one who does not eat everything. And the one who does not eat must not judge the person who does. God has accepted him as he is."},{"num":4,"verse":"Why do you judge another person's servant? He stands or he falls before his own master. But he will stand because the Lord can give him power to stand."},{"num":5,"verse":"One man thinks, `This day is better than that day.' But another man thinks, `All days are alike.' Every man should be sure in his own mind what he believes."},{"num":6,"verse":"One man honours the day to honour the Lord; another man does not honour the day to honour the Lord.
