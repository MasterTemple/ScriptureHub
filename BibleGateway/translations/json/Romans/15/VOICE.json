[{"num":15,"verse":"So now what? We who are strong are not just to satisfy our own desires. We are called to carry the weaknesses of those who are not strong. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Each of us must strive to please our neighbors, pursuing their welfare so they will become strong. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The Anointed One Himself is our model for this kind of living, for He did not live to please Himself. And as the Scriptures declared, “When they insult You, they insult me.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"You see, everything written in the days of old was recorded to give us instructions for living. We find encouragement through the Scriptures and a call to perseverance that will produce hopeful living. "},{"num":5,"verse":"I pray that our God, who calls you and gives you perseverance and encouragement, will join all of you together to share one mind according to Jesus the Anointed. "},{"num":6,"verse":"In this unity, you will share one voice as you glorify the one True God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, our Liberating King."},{"num":7,"verse":"So accept one another in the same way the Anointed has accepted you so that God will get the praise He is due. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For, as I am fond of saying, the Anointed One has become a servant of the Jews in order to demonstrate God’s truth. Effectively this confirms the promises He made to our ancestors "},{"num":9,"verse":"and causes the non-Jewish nations to glorify God for His mercy.

"},{"num":19,"verse":"My words and actions have been rooted in Spirit-empowered signs and miracles. The upshot is this: I have been able to preach the good news of the Anointed One in city after city from Jerusalem all the way around the Mediterranean to Illyricum. "},{"num":20,"verse":"I have dreamed of preaching the gospel in places where no one has ever heard of the Anointed so that I do not build on a foundation laid by anyone else. "},{"num":21,"verse":"But as the Scriptures say,"},{"num":22,"verse":"Because of many issues, I have not been able to visit you in the city of Rome. "},{"num":23,"verse":"But my time to serve those here is coming to an end, there’s no room left for me in this region, and I have longed to come to you for many years.
