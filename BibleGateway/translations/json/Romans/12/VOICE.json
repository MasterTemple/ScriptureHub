As a result, you will be able to discern what God wills and whatever God finds good, pleasing, and complete."},{"num":3,"verse":"Because of the grace allotted to me, I can respectfully tell you not to think of yourselves as being more important than you are; devote your minds to sound judgment since God has assigned to each of us a measure of faith. "},{"num":4,"verse":"For in the same way that one body has so many different parts, each with different functions; "},{"num":5,"verse":"we, too—the many—are different parts that form one body in the Anointed One. Each one of us is joined with one another, and we become together what we could not be alone. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Since our gifts vary depending on the grace poured out on each of us, it is important that we exercise the gifts we have been given.
