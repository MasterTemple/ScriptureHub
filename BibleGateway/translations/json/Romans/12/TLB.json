"},{"num":2,"verse":"Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but be a new and different person with a fresh newness in all you do and think.

"},{"num":4,"verse":"Just as there are many parts to our bodies, so it is with Christ’s body. We are all parts of it, and it takes every one of us to make it complete, for we each have different work to do. So we belong to each other, and each needs all the others."},{"num":6,"verse":"God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, then prophesy whenever you can—as often as your faith is strong enough to receive a message from God. "},{"num":7,"verse":"If your gift is that of serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, do a good job of teaching. "},{"num":8,"verse":"If you are a preacher, see to it that your sermons are strong and helpful. If God has given you money, be generous in helping others with it. If God has given you administrative ability and put you in charge of the work of others, take the responsibility seriously. Those who offer comfort to the sorrowing should do so with Christian cheer."},{"num":9,"verse":"Don’t just pretend that you love others: really love them. Hate what is wrong.
