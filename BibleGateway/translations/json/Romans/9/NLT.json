My conscience and the Holy Spirit confirm it."},{"num":2,"verse":"My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief"},{"num":3,"verse":"for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters. I would be willing to be forever cursed—cut off from Christ!—if that would save them."},{"num":4,"verse":"They are the people of Israel, chosen to be God’s adopted children. God revealed his glory to them. He made covenants with them and gave them his law. He gave them the privilege of worshiping him and receiving his wonderful promises."},{"num":5,"verse":"Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are their ancestors, and Christ himself was an Israelite as far as his human nature is concerned. And he is God, the one who rules over everything and is worthy of eternal praise! Amen."},{"num":6,"verse":"Well then, has God failed to fulfill his promise to Israel? No, for not all who are born into the nation of Israel are truly members of God’s people!"},{"num":7,"verse":"Being descendants of Abraham doesn’t make them truly Abraham’s children. For the Scriptures say, “Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted,” though Abraham had other children, too."},{"num":8,"verse":"This means that Abraham’s physical descendants are not necessarily children of God. Only the children of the promise are considered to be Abraham’s children."},{"num":9,"verse":"For God had promised, “I will return about this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"This son was our ancestor Isaac.

Of course not!"},{"num":15,"verse":"For God said to Moses,"},{"num":16,"verse":"So it is God who decides to show mercy. We can neither choose it nor work for it."},{"num":17,"verse":"For the Scriptures say that God told Pharaoh, “I have appointed you for the very purpose of displaying my power in you and to spread my fame throughout the earth.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"So you see, God chooses to show mercy to some, and he chooses to harden the hearts of others so they refuse to listen."},{"num":19,"verse":"Well then, you might say, “Why does God blame people for not responding? Haven’t they simply done what he makes them do?”"},{"num":20,"verse":"No, don’t say that. Who are you, a mere human being, to argue with God? Should the thing that was created say to the one who created it, “Why have you made me like this?”"},{"num":21,"verse":"When a potter makes jars out of clay, doesn’t he have a right to use the same lump of clay to make one jar for decoration and another to throw garbage into?"},{"num":22,"verse":"In the same way, even though God has the right to show his anger and his power, he is very patient with those on whom his anger falls, who are destined for destruction."},{"num":23,"verse":"He does this to make the riches of his glory shine even brighter on those to whom he shows mercy, who were prepared in advance for glory."},{"num":24,"verse":"And we are among those whom he selected, both from the Jews and from the Gentiles."},{"num":25,"verse":"Concerning the Gentiles, God says in the prophecy of Hosea,"},{"num":26,"verse":"And,"},{"num":27,"verse":"And concerning Israel, Isaiah the prophet cried out,"},{"num":29,"verse":"And Isaiah said the same thing in another place:"},{"header":"Israel’s Unbelief"},{"num":30,"verse":"What does all this mean?
