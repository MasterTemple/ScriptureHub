[{"header":"Concern for Israel"},{"num":9,"verse":"I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me [enlightened and prompted] by the Holy Spirit, "},{"num":2,"verse":"that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For [if it were possible] I would wish that I myself were accursed, [separated, banished] from Christ for the sake [of the salvation] of my brothers, my natural kinsmen, "},{"num":4,"verse":"who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, the glory (Shekinah), the [special] covenants [with Abraham, Moses, and David], the giving of the Law, the [system of temple] worship, and the [original] promises. "},{"num":5,"verse":"To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to His natural descent, came the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), He who is exalted and supreme over all, God blessed forever. Amen."},{"num":6,"verse":"However, it is not as though God’s word has failed [coming to nothing]. For not all who are descended from Israel (Jacob) are [the true] Israel; "},{"num":7,"verse":"and they are not all the children of Abraham because they are his descendants [by blood], but [the promise was]: “Your descendants will be named through Isaac” [though Abraham had other sons]. "},{"num":8,"verse":"That is, it is not the children of the body [Abraham’s natural descendants] who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are counted as [Abraham’s true] descendants. "},{"num":9,"verse":"For this is what the promise said: “About this time [next year] I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.” "},{"num":10,"verse":"And not only that, but this too: Rebekah conceived twin sons by one man [under the same circumstances], by our father Isaac; "},{"num":11,"verse":"and though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything either good or bad, so that God’s purpose [His choice, His election] would stand, not because of works [done by either child], but because of [the plan of] Him who calls them, "},{"num":12,"verse":"it was said to her, “The older (Esau) will serve the younger (Jacob).” "},{"num":13,"verse":"As it is written and forever remains written, “Jacob I loved (chose, protected, blessed), but Esau I hated (held in disregard compared to Jacob).”"},{"num":14,"verse":"What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not! "},{"num":15,"verse":"For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassion.” "},{"num":16,"verse":"So then God’s choice is not dependent on human will, nor on human effort [the totality of human striving], but on God who shows mercy [to whomever He chooses—it is His sovereign gift].

For who [including myself] has [ever] resisted His will and purpose?” "},{"num":20,"verse":"On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers [arrogantly] back to God and dares to defy Him?
