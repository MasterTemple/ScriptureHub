[{"num":8,"verse":"So there is now no condemnation awaiting those who belong to Christ Jesus. "},{"num":2,"verse":"For the power of the life-giving Spirit—and this power is mine through Christ Jesus—has freed me from the vicious circle of sin and death. "},{"num":3,"verse":"We aren’t saved from sin’s grasp by knowing the commandments of God because we can’t and don’t keep them, but God put into effect a different plan to save us. He sent his own Son in a human body like ours—except that ours are sinful—and destroyed sin’s control over us by giving himself as a sacrifice for our sins. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So now we can obey God’s laws if we follow after the Holy Spirit and no longer obey the old evil nature within us."},{"num":5,"verse":"Those who let themselves be controlled by their lower natures live only to please themselves, but those who follow after the Holy Spirit find themselves doing those things that please God. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Following after the Holy Spirit leads to life and peace, but following after the old nature leads to death "},{"num":7,"verse":"because the old sinful nature within us is against God. It never did obey God’s laws and it never will. "},{"num":8,"verse":"That’s why those who are still under the control of their old sinful selves, bent on following their old evil desires, can never please God."},{"num":9,"verse":"But you are not like that. You are controlled by your new nature if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that if anyone doesn’t have the Spirit of Christ living in him, he is not a Christian at all.) "},{"num":10,"verse":"Yet, even though Christ lives within you, your body will die because of sin; but your spirit will live, for Christ has pardoned it. "},{"num":11,"verse":"And if the Spirit of God, who raised up Jesus from the dead, lives in you, he will make your dying bodies live again after you die, by means of this same Holy Spirit living within you."},{"num":12,"verse":"So, dear brothers, you have no obligations whatever to your old sinful nature to do what it begs you to do. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For if you keep on following it you are lost and will perish, but if through the power of the Holy Spirit you crush it and its evil deeds, you shall live. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God."},{"num":15,"verse":"And so we should not be like cringing, fearful slaves, but we should behave like God’s very own children, adopted into the bosom of his family, and calling to him, “Father, Father.” "},{"num":16,"verse":"For his Holy Spirit speaks to us deep in our hearts and tells us that we really are God’s children. "},{"num":17,"verse":"And since we are his children, we will share his treasures—for all God gives to his Son Jesus is now ours too. But if we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering."},{"num":18,"verse":"Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will give us later. "},{"num":19,"verse":"For all creation is waiting patiently and hopefully for that future day when God will resurrect his children. "},{"num":20,"verse":"For on that day thorns and thistles, sin, death, and decay—the things that overcame the world against its will at God’s command—will all disappear, and the world around us will share in the glorious freedom from sin which God’s children enjoy."},{"num":22,"verse":"For we know that even the things of nature, like animals and plants, suffer in sickness and death as they await this great event. "},{"num":23,"verse":"And even we Christians, although we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future glory, also groan to be released from pain and suffering. We, too, wait anxiously for that day when God will give us our full rights as his children, including the new bodies he has promised us—bodies that will never be sick again and will never die."},{"num":24,"verse":"We are saved by trusting. And trusting means looking forward to getting something we don’t yet have—for a man who already has something doesn’t need to hope and trust that he will get it. "},{"num":25,"verse":"But if we must keep trusting God for something that hasn’t happened yet, it teaches us to wait patiently and confidently."},{"num":26,"verse":"And in the same way—by our faith—the Holy Spirit helps us with our daily problems and in our praying. For we don’t even know what we should pray for nor how to pray as we should, but the Holy Spirit prays for us with such feeling that it cannot be expressed in words. "},{"num":27,"verse":"And the Father who knows all hearts knows, of course, what the Spirit is saying as he pleads for us in harmony with God’s own will. "},{"num":28,"verse":"And we know that all that happens to us is working for our good if we love God and are fitting into his plans."},{"num":29,"verse":"For from the very beginning God decided that those who came to him—and all along he knew who would—should become like his Son, so that his Son would be the First, with many brothers. "},{"num":30,"verse":"And having chosen us, he called us to come to him; and when we came, he declared us “not guilty,” filled us with Christ’s goodness, gave us right standing with himself, and promised us his glory."},{"num":31,"verse":"What can we ever say to such wonderful things as these? If God is on our side, who can ever be against us? "},{"num":32,"verse":"Since he did not spare even his own Son for us but gave him up for us all, won’t he also surely give us everything else?"},{"num":33,"verse":"Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? Will God? No! He is the one who has forgiven us and given us right standing with himself."},{"num":34,"verse":"Who then will condemn us? Will Christ? No! For he is the one who died for us and came back to life again for us and is sitting at the place of highest honor next to God, pleading for us there in heaven."},{"num":35,"verse":"Who then can ever keep Christ’s love from us? When we have trouble or calamity, when we are hunted down or destroyed, is it because he doesn’t love us anymore? And if we are hungry or penniless or in danger or threatened with death, has God deserted us?"},{"num":36,"verse":"No, for the Scriptures tell us that for his sake we must be ready to face death at every moment of the day—we are like sheep awaiting slaughter; "},{"num":37,"verse":"but despite all this, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ who loved us enough to die for us. "},{"num":38,"verse":"For I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love. Death can’t, and life can’t. The angels won’t, and all the powers of hell itself cannot keep God’s love away. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, "},{"num":39,"verse":"or where we are—high above the sky, or in the deepest ocean—nothing will ever be able to separate us from the love of God demonstrated by our Lord Jesus Christ when he died for us."}]
