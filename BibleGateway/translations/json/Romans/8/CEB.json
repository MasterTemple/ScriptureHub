Now the way we live is based on the Spirit, not based on selfishness."},{"num":5,"verse":"People whose lives are based on selfishness think about selfish things, but people whose lives are based on the Spirit think about things that are related to the Spirit."},{"num":6,"verse":"The attitude that comes from selfishness leads to death, but the attitude that comes from the Spirit leads to life and peace."},{"num":7,"verse":"So the attitude that comes from selfishness is hostile to God.
