By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"so that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their outlook shaped by the things of the Spirit. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For the outlook of the flesh is death, but the outlook of the Spirit is life and peace, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
