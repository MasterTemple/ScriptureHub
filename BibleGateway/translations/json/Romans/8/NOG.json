"},{"num":3,"verse":"It is impossible to do what God’s standards demand because of the weakness our human nature has. But God sent his Son to have a human nature as sinners have and to pay for sin. That way God condemned sin in our corrupt nature. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Therefore, we, who do not live by our corrupt nature but by our spiritual nature, are able to meet God’s standards in Moses’ Teachings."},{"num":5,"verse":"Those who live by the corrupt nature have the corrupt nature’s attitude. But those who live by the spiritual nature have the spiritual nature’s attitude. "},{"num":6,"verse":"The corrupt nature’s attitude leads to death. But the spiritual nature’s attitude leads to life and peace. "},{"num":7,"verse":"This is so because the corrupt nature has a hostile attitude toward God. It refuses to place itself under the authority of God’s standards because it can’t. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Those who are under the control of the corrupt nature can’t please God. "},{"num":9,"verse":"But if God’s Spirit lives in you, you are under the control of your spiritual nature, not your corrupt nature."},{"num":10,"verse":"However, if Christ lives in you, your bodies are dead because of sin, but your spirits are alive because you have God’s approval.

Therefore, his Son is the firstborn among many children. "},{"num":30,"verse":"He also called those whom he had already appointed. He approved of those whom he had called, and he gave glory to those whom he had approved of."},{"num":31,"verse":"What can we say about all of this? If God is for us, who can be against us?
