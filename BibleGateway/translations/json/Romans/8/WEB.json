"},{"num":3,"verse":"For what the law couldn’t do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh; "},{"num":4,"verse":"that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. "},{"num":5,"verse":"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace; "},{"num":7,"verse":"because the mind of the flesh is hostile toward God; for it is not subject to God’s law, neither indeed can it be. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Those who are in the flesh can’t please God. "},{"num":9,"verse":"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you.
