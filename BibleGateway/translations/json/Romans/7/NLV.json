But now you are dead to it because you are joined to another. You are joined to Christ Who was raised from the dead. This is so we may be what God wants us to be. Our lives are to give fruit for Him. "},{"num":5,"verse":"When we lived to please our bodies, those sinful desires were pulling at us all the time. We always wanted to do what the Law said not to do. Living that kind of life brings death, "},{"num":6,"verse":"but now we are free from the Law. We are dead to sin that once held us in its power. No longer do we follow the Law which is the old way.
