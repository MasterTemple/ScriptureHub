[{"num":7,"verse":"Or don’t you know, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives? "},{"num":2,"verse":"For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.
