[{"header":"An Example From Marriage"},{"num":7,"verse":"Brothers and sisters, I am speaking to you who know the law. Don’t you know that the law has authority over someone only as long as they live?

"},{"num":3,"verse":"But suppose that married woman sleeps with another man while her husband is still alive. Then she is called a woman who commits adultery. But suppose her husband dies. Then she is free from that law. She is not guilty of adultery if she marries another man."},{"num":4,"verse":"My brothers and sisters, when Christ died you also died as far as the law is concerned. Then it became possible for you to belong to him. He was raised from the dead. Now our lives can be useful to God. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The power of sin used to control us. The law stirred up sinful desires in us. So the things we did resulted in death. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But now we have died to what used to control us. We have been set free from the law.

Not at all! Yet I wouldn’t have known what sin was unless the law had told me. The law says, “Do not want what belongs to other people.” (Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21) If the law hadn’t said that, I would not have known what it was like to want what belongs to others.

It used the commandment to put me to death. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So the law is holy. The commandment also is holy and right and good."},{"num":13,"verse":"Did what is good cause me to die? Not at all! Sin had to be recognized for what it really is. So it used what is good to bring about my death.
