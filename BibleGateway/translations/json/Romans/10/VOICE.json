[{"num":10,"verse":"My brothers and sisters, I pray constantly to God for the salvation of my people; it is the deep desire of my heart. "},{"num":2,"verse":"What I can say about them is that they are enthusiastic about God, but that won’t lead them to Him because their zeal is not based on true knowledge. "},{"num":3,"verse":"In their ignorance about how God is working to make things right, they have been trying to establish their own right standing with God through the law. But they are not operating under God’s saving, restorative justice. "},{"num":4,"verse":"You see, God’s purpose for the law reaches its climax when the Anointed One arrives; now all who trust in Him can have their lives made right with God."},{"num":5,"verse":"Moses made this clear long ago when he wrote about what it takes to have a right relationship with God based on the law: “The person devoted to the law’s commands will live by them.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"But a right relationship based on faith sounds like this: “Do not say to yourselves, ‘Who will go up into heaven?’” (that is, to bring down the Anointed One), "},{"num":7,"verse":"“or, ‘Who will go down into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring the Anointed One up from the dead). "},{"num":8,"verse":"But what does it actually say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the good news we have been called to preach to you). "},{"num":9,"verse":"So if you believe deep in your heart that God raised Jesus from the pit of death and if you voice your allegiance by confessing the truth that “Jesus is Lord,” then you will be saved! "},{"num":10,"verse":"Belief begins in the heart and leads to a life that’s right with God; confession departs from our lips and brings eternal salvation. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Because what Isaiah said was true: “The one who trusts in Him will not be disgraced.” "},{"num":12,"verse":"Remember that the Lord draws no distinction between Jew and non-Jew—He is Lord over all things, and He pours out His treasures on all who invoke His name "},{"num":13,"verse":"because as Scripture says, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"How can people invoke His name when they do not believe? How can they believe in Him when they have not heard? How can they hear if there is no one proclaiming Him? "},{"num":15,"verse":"How can some give voice to the truth if they are not sent by God? As Isaiah said, “Ah, how beautiful the feet of those who declare the good news of victory, of peace and liberation.” "},{"num":16,"verse":"But some will hear the good news and refuse to submit to the truth they hear. Isaiah the prophet also says, “Lord, who would ever believe it? Who would possibly accept what we’ve been told?” "},{"num":17,"verse":"So faith proceeds from hearing, as we listen to the message about God’s Anointed."},{"num":18,"verse":"But let me ask this: have my people ever heard? Indeed, they have:"},{"num":19,"verse":"But again let me ask: did Israel perhaps hear and not understand all of this? Well, Moses was the first to say,"},{"num":20,"verse":"Then Isaiah the fearless prophet says it this way:"},{"num":21,"verse":"And as to the fate of Israel, God says,"}]
