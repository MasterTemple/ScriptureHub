They have a strong desire for God, but they do not know what they should about Him. "},{"num":3,"verse":"They have not known how God makes men right with Himself. Instead, they have tried to make their own way. They have not become right with God because they have not done what God said to do. "},{"num":4,"verse":"For Christ has put an end to the Law, so everyone who has put his trust in Christ is made right with God."},{"num":5,"verse":"Moses writes that the man who obeys the Law has to live by it.

You do not need to ask yourself, “Who will go up to heaven to bring Christ down?” "},{"num":7,"verse":"And you do not need to ask, “Who will go below and bring Christ up from the dead?” "},{"num":8,"verse":"This is what it says, “The Good News is near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart.”  This Good News tells about putting your trust in Christ. This is what we preach to you.
