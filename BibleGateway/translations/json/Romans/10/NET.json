[{"num":10,"verse":"Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God on behalf of my fellow Israelites is for their salvation. "},{"num":2,"verse":"For I can testify that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not in line with the truth. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For ignoring the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking instead to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. "},{"num":4,"verse":"For Christ is the end of the law, with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes."},{"num":5,"verse":"For Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law: “The one who does these things will live by them.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down) "},{"num":7,"verse":"or “Who will descend into the abyss?” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). "},{"num":8,"verse":"But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we preach), "},{"num":9,"verse":"because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
