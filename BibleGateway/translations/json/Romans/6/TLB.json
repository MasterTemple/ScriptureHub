"},{"num":4,"verse":"Your old sin-loving nature was buried with him by baptism when he died; and when God the Father, with glorious power, brought him back to life again, you were given his wonderful new life to enjoy."},{"num":5,"verse":"For you have become a part of him, and so you died with him, so to speak, when he died; and now you share his new life and shall rise as he did. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Your old evil desires were nailed to the cross with him; that part of you that loves to sin was crushed and fatally wounded, so that your sin-loving body is no longer under sin’s control, no longer needs to be a slave to sin; "},{"num":7,"verse":"for when you are deadened to sin you are freed from all its allure and its power over you.

Death no longer has any power over him. "},{"num":10,"verse":"He died once for all to end sin’s power, but now he lives forever in unbroken fellowship with God.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"Do not let any part of your bodies become tools of wickedness, to be used for sinning; but give yourselves completely to God—every part of you—for you are back from death and you want to be tools in the hands of God, to be used for his good purposes.
