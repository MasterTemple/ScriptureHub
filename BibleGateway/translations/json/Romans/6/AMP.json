Should we continue in sin  practice sin as a habit so that [God’s gift of] grace may increase  overflow? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Certainly not! How can we, the very ones who died to sin,  live in it any longer? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Or are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"We have therefore been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory  power of the Father, we too might walk  in newness of life [abandoning our old ways]. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For if we have become one with Him [permanently united] in the likeness of His death, we will also certainly be [one with Him and share fully]  of His resurrection. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"We know that our old self [our human nature without the Holy Spirit] was nailed to the cross with , in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin.

Shall we sin because we are not under Law, but under [God’s] grace? Certainly not!
