"},{"num":2,"verse":"What a terrible thought! We have died to sin once and for all, as a dead man passes away from this life. So how could we live under sin’s rule a moment longer? "},{"num":3,"verse":"Or have you forgotten that all of us who were immersed into union with Jesus, the Anointed One, were immersed into union with his death?"},{"num":4,"verse":"Sharing in his death by our baptism means that we were co-buried with him, so that when the Father’s glory raised Christ from the dead, we were also raised with him. We have been co-resurrected with him so that we could be empowered to walk in the freshness of new life. "},{"num":5,"verse":"For since we are permanently grafted into him to experience a death like his, then we are permanently grafted into him to experience a resurrection like his and the new life that it imparts."},{"num":6,"verse":"Could it be any clearer that our former identity is now and forever deprived of its power?

Should we sin to our hearts’ content since there’s no law to condemn us anymore? What a terrible thought! "},{"num":16,"verse":"Don’t you realize that grace frees you to choose your own master?
