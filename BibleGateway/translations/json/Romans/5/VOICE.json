[{"num":5,"verse":"Since we have been acquitted and made right through faith, we are able to experience true and lasting peace with God through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed One, the Liberating King. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Jesus leads us into a place of radical grace where we are able to celebrate the hope of experiencing God’s glory. "},{"num":3,"verse":"And that’s not all. We also celebrate in seasons of suffering because we know that when we suffer we develop endurance, "},{"num":4,"verse":"which shapes our characters. When our characters are refined, we learn what it means to hope and anticipate God’s goodness. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And hope will never fail to satisfy our deepest need because the Holy Spirit that was given to us has flooded our hearts with God’s love."},{"num":6,"verse":"When the time was right, the Anointed One died for all of us who were far from God, powerless, and weak. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Now it is rare to find someone willing to die for an upright person, although it’s possible that someone may give up his life for one who is truly good. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But think about this: while we were wasting our lives in sin, God revealed His powerful love to us in a tangible display—the Anointed One died for us. "},{"num":9,"verse":"As a result, the blood of Jesus has made us right with God now, and certainly we will be rescued by Him from God’s wrath in the future. "},{"num":10,"verse":"If we were in the heat of combat with God when His Son reconciled us by laying down His life, then how much more will we be saved by Jesus’ resurrection life? "},{"num":11,"verse":"In fact, we stand now reconciled and at peace with God. That’s why we celebrate in God through our Lord Jesus, the Anointed."},{"num":12,"verse":"Consider this: sin entered our world through one man, Adam; and through sin, death followed in hot pursuit. Death spread rapidly to infect all people on the earth as they engaged in sin."},{"num":13,"verse":"Before God gave the law, sin existed, but there was no way to account for it. Outside the law, how could anyone be charged and found guilty of sin? "},{"num":14,"verse":"Still, death plagued all humanity from Adam to Moses, even those whose sin was of a different sort than Adam’s. You see, in God’s plan, Adam was a prototype of the One who comes to usher in a new day. "},{"num":15,"verse":"But the free gift of grace bears no resemblance to Adam’s crime that brings a death sentence to all of humanity; in fact, it is quite the opposite. For if the one man’s sin brings death to so many, how much more does the gift of God’s radical grace extend to humanity since Jesus the Anointed offered His generous gift. "},{"num":16,"verse":"His free gift is nothing like the scourge of the first man’s sin. The judgment that fell because of one false step brought condemnation, but the free gift following countless offenses results in a favorable verdict—not guilty. "},{"num":17,"verse":"If one man’s sin brought a reign of death—that’s Adam’s legacy—how much more will those who receive grace in abundance and the free gift of redeeming justice reign in life by means of one other man—Jesus the Anointed."},{"num":18,"verse":"So here is the result: as one man’s sin brought about condemnation and punishment for all people, so one man’s act of faithfulness makes all of us right with God and brings us to new life.

No matter how much sin crept in, there was always more grace."},{"num":21,"verse":"In the same way that sin reigned in the sphere of death, now grace reigns through God’s restorative justice, eclipsing death and leading to eternal life through the Anointed One, Jesus our Lord, the Liberating King."}]
