[{"header":"We Enjoy Peace with God through Jesus"},{"num":5,"verse":"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus the Messiah. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace by which we have been established, and we boast because of our hope in God’s glory. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, "},{"num":4,"verse":"endurance produces character, and character produces hope. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Now this hope does not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us."},{"num":6,"verse":"For at just the right time, while we were still powerless, the Messiah died for the ungodly. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For it is rare for anyone to die for a righteous person, though somebody might be brave enough to die for a good person. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But God demonstrates his love for us by the fact that the Messiah died for us while we were still sinners."},{"num":9,"verse":"Now that we have been justified by his blood, how much more will we be saved from wrath through him!
