[{"num":5,"verse":"So, since we have come to be considered righteous by God because of our trust, let us continue to have shalom with God through our Lord, Yeshua the Messiah. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Also through him and on the ground of our trust, we have gained access to this grace in which we stand; so let us boast about the hope of experiencing God’s glory. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But not only that, let us also boast in our troubles; because we know that trouble produces endurance, "},{"num":4,"verse":"endurance produces character, and character produces hope; "},{"num":5,"verse":"and this hope does not let us down, because God’s love for us has already been poured out in our hearts through the Ruach HaKodesh who has been given to us."},{"num":6,"verse":"For while we were still helpless, at the right time, the Messiah died on behalf of ungodly people. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Now it is a rare event when someone gives up his life even for the sake of somebody righteous, although possibly for a truly good person one might have the courage to die. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But God demonstrates his own love for us in that the Messiah died on our behalf while we were still sinners. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Therefore, since we have now come to be considered righteous by means of his bloody sacrificial death, how much more will we be delivered through him from the anger of God’s judgment! "},{"num":10,"verse":"For if we were reconciled with God through his Son’s death when we were enemies, how much more will we be delivered by his life, now that we are reconciled! "},{"num":11,"verse":"And not only will we be delivered in the future, but we are boasting about God right now, because he has acted through our Lord Yeshua the Messiah, through whom we have already received that reconciliation."},{"num":12,"verse":"Here is how it works: it was through one individual that sin entered the world, and through sin, death; and in this way death passed through to the whole human race, inasmuch as everyone sinned. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Sin was indeed present in the world before Torah was given, but sin is not counted as such when there is no Torah. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Nevertheless death ruled from Adam until Moshe, even over those whose sinning was not exactly like Adam’s violation of a direct command. In this, Adam prefigured the one who was to come."},{"num":15,"verse":"But the free gift is not like the offence. For if, because of one man’s offence, many died, then how much more has God’s grace, that is, the gracious gift of one man, Yeshua the Messiah, overflowed to many! "},{"num":16,"verse":"No, the free gift is not like what resulted from one man’s sinning; for from one sinner came judgment that brought condemnation; but the free gift came after many offences and brought acquittal. "},{"num":17,"verse":"For if, because of the offence of one man, death ruled through that one man; how much more will those receiving the overflowing grace, that is, the gift of being considered righteous, rule in life through the one man Yeshua the Messiah!"},{"num":18,"verse":"In other words, just as it was through one offence that all people came under condemnation, so also it is through one righteous act that all people come to be considered righteous. "},{"num":19,"verse":"For just as through the disobedience of the one man, many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the other man, many will be made righteous. "},{"num":20,"verse":"And the Torah came into the picture so that the offence would proliferate; but where sin proliferated, grace proliferated even more. "},{"num":21,"verse":"All this happened so that just as sin ruled by means of death, so also grace might rule through causing people to be considered righteous, so that they might have eternal life, through Yeshua the Messiah, our Lord."}]
