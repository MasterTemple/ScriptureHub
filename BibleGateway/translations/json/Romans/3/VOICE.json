[{"num":3,"verse":"So then, do the Jews have an advantage over the other nations? Does circumcision do anything for you? "},{"num":2,"verse":"The answer is yes, in every way. To begin with, God spoke to and through the Jewish people. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But what if some Jews have been unfaithful? Does the fact that they abandoned their faith zero out God’s faithfulness? "},{"num":4,"verse":"Absolutely not! If every person on the planet were a liar and thief, God would still be true. It stands written:"},{"num":5,"verse":"If our perpetual injustice and corruption merely accentuate the purity of God’s justice, what can we say? Is God unjust for unleashing His fury against us? (I am speaking from our limited human perspective.) "},{"num":6,"verse":"Again, absolutely not! If this were so, how could God stand as Judge over the world? "},{"num":7,"verse":"But if my lie serves only to point out God’s truth and bring Him glory, then why am I being judged for my sin?

Are we Jews better off? Not at all. We have made it clear that people everywhere, Jews and non-Jews, are living under the power of sin. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Here’s what Scripture says:"},{"num":19,"verse":"We want to be clear that whatever the law says, it says to everyone who is under its authority. Its purpose is to muzzle every mouth, to silence idle talk, and to bring the whole world under the standard of God’s justice.

Both the law and the prophets told us this day would come.
