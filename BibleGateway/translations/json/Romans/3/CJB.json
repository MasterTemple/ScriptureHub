In the first place, the Jews were entrusted with the very words of God. "},{"num":3,"verse":"If some of them were unfaithful, so what? Does their faithlessness cancel God’s faithfulness? "},{"num":4,"verse":"Heaven forbid! God would be true even if everyone were a liar! — as the Tanakh says,"},{"num":5,"verse":"Now if our unrighteousness highlights God’s righteousness, what should we say?
