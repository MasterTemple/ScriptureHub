Well, when Israel tried to be right with God on her own, pursuing her own self-interest, she didn’t succeed.

Are they out of this for good?” And the answer is a clear-cut . Ironically when they walked out, they left the door open and the outsiders walked in. But the next thing you know, the Jews were starting to wonder if perhaps they had walked out on a good thing. Now, if their leaving triggered this worldwide coming of non-Jewish outsiders to God’s kingdom, just imagine the effect of their coming back! What a homecoming!"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But I don’t want to go on about them. It’s you, the outsiders, that I’m concerned with now.

Remember, you aren’t feeding the root; the root is feeding you."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"It’s certainly possible to say, “Other branches were pruned so that  could be grafted in!” Well and good. But they were pruned because they were deadwood, no longer connected by belief and commitment to the root. The only reason you’re on the tree is because your graft “took” when you believed, and because you’re connected to that belief-nurturing root. So don’t get cocky and strut your branch. Be humbly mindful of the root that keeps you lithe and green."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If God didn’t think twice about taking pruning shears to the natural branches, why would he hesitate over you? He wouldn’t give it a second thought.

But don’t presume on this gentleness. The moment you become deadwood, it’s game over."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And don’t get to feeling superior to those pruned branches down on the ground. If they don’t persist in remaining deadwood, they could very well get grafted back in. God can do that. He can perform miracle grafts. Why, if he could graft —branches cut from a tree out in the wild—into an orchard tree, he certainly isn’t going to have any trouble grafting branches back into the tree they grew from in the first place.
