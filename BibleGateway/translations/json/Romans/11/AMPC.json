[{"num":11,"verse":"I ask then: Has God totally rejected and disowned His people? Of course not! Why, I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin!"},{"num":2,"verse":"No, God has not rejected and disowned His people [whose destiny] He had marked out and appointed and foreknown from the beginning. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?"},{"num":3,"verse":"Lord, they have killed Your prophets; they have demolished Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life."},{"num":4,"verse":"But what is God’s reply to him? I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal!"},{"num":5,"verse":"So too at the present time there is a remnant (a small believing minority), selected (chosen) by grace (by God’s unmerited favor and graciousness)."},{"num":6,"verse":"But if it is by grace (His unmerited favor and graciousness), it is no longer conditioned on works or anything men have done. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace [it would be meaningless]."},{"num":7,"verse":"What then [shall we conclude]? Israel failed to obtain what it sought [God’s favor by obedience to the Law]. Only the elect (those chosen few) obtained it, while the rest of them became callously indifferent (blinded, hardened, and made insensible to it)."},{"num":8,"verse":"As it is written, God gave them a spirit (an attitude) of stupor, eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear, [that has continued] down to this very day."},{"num":9,"verse":"And David says, Let their table (their feasting, banqueting) become a snare and a trap, a pitfall and a just retribution [rebounding like a boomerang upon them];"},{"num":10,"verse":"Let their eyes be darkened (dimmed) so that they cannot see, and make them bend their back [stooping beneath their burden] forever."},{"num":11,"verse":"So I ask, Have they stumbled so as to fall [to their utter spiritual ruin, irretrievably]? By no means! But through their false step and transgression salvation [has come] to the Gentiles, so as to arouse Israel [to see and feel what they forfeited] and so to make them jealous."},{"num":12,"verse":"Now if their stumbling (their lapse, their transgression) has so enriched the world [at large], and if [Israel’s] failure means such riches for the Gentiles, think what an enrichment and greater advantage will follow their full reinstatement!"},{"num":13,"verse":"But now I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I lay great stress on my ministry and magnify my office,"},{"num":14,"verse":"In the hope of making my fellow Jews jealous [in order to stir them up to imitate, copy, and appropriate], and thus managing to save some of them."},{"num":15,"verse":"For if their rejection and exclusion from the benefits of salvation were [overruled] for the reconciliation of a world to God, what will their acceptance and admission mean? [It will be nothing short of] life from the dead!"},{"num":16,"verse":"Now if the first handful of dough offered as the firstfruits [Abraham and the patriarchs] is consecrated (holy), so is the whole mass [the nation of Israel]; and if the root [Abraham] is consecrated (holy), so are the branches."},{"num":17,"verse":"But if some of the branches were broken off, while you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them to share the richness [of the root and sap] of the olive tree,"},{"num":18,"verse":"Do not boast over the branches and pride yourself at their expense. If you do boast and feel superior, remember it is not you that support the root, but the root [that supports] you."},{"num":19,"verse":"You will say then, Branches were broken (pruned) off so that I might be grafted in!"},{"num":20,"verse":"That is true. But they were broken (pruned) off because of their unbelief (their lack of real faith), and you are established through faith [because you do believe]. So do not become proud and conceited, but rather stand in awe and be reverently afraid."},{"num":21,"verse":"For if God did not spare the natural branches [because of unbelief], neither will He spare you [if you are guilty of the same offense]."},{"num":22,"verse":"Then note and appreciate the gracious kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God’s gracious kindness to you—provided you continue in His grace and abide in His kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off (pruned away)."},{"num":23,"verse":"And even those others [the fallen branches, Jews], if they do not persist in [clinging to] their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again."},{"num":24,"verse":"For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and against nature grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much easier will it be to graft these natural [branches] back on [the original parent stock of] their own olive tree."},{"num":25,"verse":"Lest you be self-opinionated (wise in your own conceits), I do not want you to miss this hidden truth and mystery, brethren: a hardening (insensibility) has [temporarily] befallen a part of Israel [to last] until the full number of the ingathering of the Gentiles has come in,"},{"num":26,"verse":"And so all Israel will be saved.

How unfathomable (inscrutable, unsearchable) are His judgments (His decisions)! And how untraceable (mysterious, undiscoverable) are His ways (His methods, His paths)!"},{"num":34,"verse":"For who has known the mind of the Lord and who has understood His thoughts, or who has [ever] been His counselor?"},{"num":35,"verse":"Or who has first given God anything that he might be paid back or that he could claim a recompense?"},{"num":36,"verse":"For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.
