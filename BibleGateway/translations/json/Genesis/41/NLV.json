"},{"num":3,"verse":"Then he saw seven other cows coming out of the Nile after them. They looked bad and were thin. They stood by the other cows beside the Nile. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the bad looking cows that were thin ate the seven good-looking, fat cows, and Pharaoh awoke."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. He saw seven heads of grain growing on one stick of grain. They were large and full. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Then he saw seven heads of grain come after them, which were small and made dry by the east wind. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And the small heads of grain ate the seven large, full heads of grain."},{"num":8,"verse":"So when morning came his spirit was troubled. He called for all the wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams. But there was no one who could tell Pharaoh the meaning of them."},{"num":9,"verse":"Then the head cup-carrier said to Pharaoh, “I remember today what I have done wrong. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Pharaoh was angry with his servants. And he put me and the head bread-maker in prison in the house of the head of the soldiers. "},{"num":11,"verse":"He and I had a dream on the same night. Each dream had its own meaning. "},{"num":12,"verse":"A young Hebrew was there with us. He worked for the head of the soldiers. We told our dreams to him. And he told us the meaning of them. He told each of us what our different dreams meant. "},{"num":13,"verse":"And it happened just like he had said it would. I was returned to my place of work. The bread-maker was killed on a tree.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Pharaoh then called for Joseph. And they brought him out of the prison in a hurry. He cut off the hair on his face and put on clean clothes. Then he came to Pharaoh. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream. But no one can tell me what it means. I have heard it said that you are able to hear a dream and tell what it means.” "},{"num":16,"verse":"Joseph answered Pharaoh, “Not by myself. God will give Pharaoh a good answer.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream, I was standing beside the Nile. "},{"num":18,"verse":"I saw seven cows coming out of the Nile.

I had never seen worse cows in all the land of Egypt. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Then the bad looking cows that were thin ate the first seven fat cows. "},{"num":21,"verse":"But after they had eaten them, it could not be seen that they had eaten them. For they were just as bad looking as before. Then I awoke.

The time of much food will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The time of no food will destroy the land. "},{"num":31,"verse":"The time without food will be so hard that no one in the land will remember when they had much. "},{"num":32,"verse":"That the dream was sent twice to Pharaoh shows that what will happen is planned by God.

"},{"num":34,"verse":"Let Pharaoh take action to choose men to watch over the land. And let him take a fifth part of the food of the land of Egypt during the seven years of much food. "},{"num":35,"verse":"Let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming. Have them store the grain under the power of Pharaoh, to be used as food in the cities. And let them keep it safe. "},{"num":36,"verse":"This food will be kept for the people to eat during the seven years of no food that will come upon the land of Egypt.

So Joseph went out through the land of Egypt."},{"num":46,"verse":"Joseph was thirty years old when he stood in front of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went from Pharaoh to visit every part of Egypt. "},{"num":47,"verse":"During the seven good years the land brought much food.
