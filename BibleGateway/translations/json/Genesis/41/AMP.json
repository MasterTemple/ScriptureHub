[{"header":"Pharaoh’s Dream"},{"num":41,"verse":"Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile.

"},{"num":3,"verse":"Then behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, ugly and gaunt and raw-boned, and stood by the fat cows on the bank of the Nile. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the ugly and gaunt and raw-boned cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.

And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them to him."},{"num":9,"verse":"Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I would mention my faults today. "},{"num":10,"verse":"[Two years ago] Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker. "},{"num":11,"verse":"We dreamed a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to [the significance of] the interpretation of his own dream. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Now there was with us [in the prison] a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us, to each man according to the significance of his own dream. "},{"num":13,"verse":"And just as he interpreted [the dreams] for us, so it happened; I was restored to my office [as chief cupbearer], and the baker was hanged.”"},{"header":"Joseph Interprets"},{"num":14,"verse":"Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when Joseph shaved himself and changed his clothes [making himself presentable], he came to Pharaoh. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you that you can understand a dream and interpret it.” "},{"num":16,"verse":"Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me [to interpret the dream]; God [not I] will give Pharaoh a favorable answer [through me].” "},{"num":17,"verse":"So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile; "},{"num":18,"verse":"and seven fat, sleek and handsome cows came up out of the river, and they grazed in the reed grass [of a marshy pasture].

"},{"num":31,"verse":"So the great abundance will become forgotten in the land because of that subsequent famine, for it will be very severe. "},{"num":32,"verse":"That the dream was repeated twice to Pharaoh [and in two different ways] indicates that this matter is fully determined and established by God, and God will bring it to pass very quickly. "},{"num":33,"verse":"So now let Pharaoh [prepare ahead and] look for a man discerning and clear-headed and wise, and set him [in charge] over the land of Egypt [as governor under Pharaoh].
