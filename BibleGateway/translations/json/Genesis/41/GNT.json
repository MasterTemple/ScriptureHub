[{"header":"Joseph Interprets the King's Dreams"},{"num":41,"verse":"After two years had passed, the king of Egypt dreamed that he was standing by the Nile River, "},{"num":2,"verse":"when seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the river and began to feed on the grass.

He told them his dreams, but no one could explain them to him."},{"num":9,"verse":"Then the wine steward said to the king, “I must confess today that I have done wrong. "},{"num":10,"verse":"You were angry with the chief baker and me, and you put us in prison in the house of the captain of the guard. "},{"num":11,"verse":"One night each of us had a dream, and the dreams had different meanings. "},{"num":12,"verse":"A young Hebrew was there with us, a slave of the captain of the guard.

Make way!” And so Joseph was appointed governor over all Egypt.
