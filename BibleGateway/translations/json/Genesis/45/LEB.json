"},{"num":4,"verse":"So Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” And they drew near. And he said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves that you sold me here, for God sent me as deliverance before you.

"},{"num":7,"verse":"And God sent me before you all to preserve for you a remnant in the land and to keep alive among you many survivors.
