"},{"num":3,"verse":"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you; for I will give to you and all your descendants all these lands, and I will fulfill the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of the heavens and will give your descendants all these lands. By your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed, "},{"num":5,"verse":"because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"So Isaac lived in Gerar."},{"num":7,"verse":"The men of the place asked him about his wife. And he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” thinking, “The men of the place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful in appearance.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"When he had been there a long time, Abimelek the king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah his wife.

"},{"num":21,"verse":"They dug another well and quarreled over that also. So he called the name of it Sitnah. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Then he moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it.
