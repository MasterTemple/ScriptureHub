"},{"num":3,"verse":"Dwell as an alien in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham you father. "},{"num":4,"verse":"And I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and I will give to your descendants all these lands.

"},{"num":7,"verse":"When the men of the place asked concerning his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “my wife,” thinking “the men of the place will kill me on account of Rebekah, for she was beautiful.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"And it happened that, when he had been there a long time, Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked through the window, and saw—behold—Isaac was fondling Rebekah his wife.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you have become much too powerful for us.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"So Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.
