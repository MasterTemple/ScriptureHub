"},{"num":4,"verse":"And I will cause your descendants to become as numerous as the stars! And I will give them all of these lands; and they shall be a blessing to all the nations of the earth.

"},{"num":7,"verse":"And when the men there asked him about Rebekah, he said, “She is my sister!” For he feared for his life if he told them she was his wife; he was afraid they would kill him to get her, for she was very attractive. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But sometime later, King Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looked out of a window and saw Isaac and Rebekah making love."},{"num":9,"verse":"Abimelech called for Isaac and exclaimed, “She is your wife! Why did you say she is your sister?”"},{"num":10,"verse":"“How could you treat us this way?” Abimelech exclaimed. “Someone might carelessly have raped her, and we would be doomed.” "},{"num":11,"verse":"Then Abimelech made a public proclamation: “Anyone harming this man or his wife shall die.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"That year Isaac’s crops were tremendous—100 times the grain he sowed.
