Then you can get up early and go on your way.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"But he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and they came into his house. He prepared a feast for them and baked matzot, and they ate. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They had not yet lain down when the men of the city (the men of Sodom) surrounded the house—from youth to elderly, all the people without exception.
