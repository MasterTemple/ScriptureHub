They yelled to Lot, “Where are the men who are staying with you for the night? Bring them out so we can have our sport with them!”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Lot went out, barring the door behind him, and said, “Brothers, please, don’t be vile!

Don’t stop anywhere on the plain—run for the hills or you’ll be swept away.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"But Lot protested, “No, masters, you can’t mean it! I know that you’ve taken a liking to me and have done me an immense favor in saving my life, but I can’t run for the mountains—who knows what terrible thing might happen to me in the mountains and leave me for dead. Look over there—that town is close enough to get to. It’s a small town, hardly anything to it. Let me escape there and save my life—it’s a mere wide place in the road.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"“All right, Lot. If you insist. I’ll let you have your way.
