You may then get up early in the morning and be on your way again.”“Oh no,” they replied. “We’ll just spend the night out here in the city square.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But Lot insisted, so at last they went home with him. Lot prepared a feast for them, complete with fresh bread made without yeast, and they ate."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But before they retired for the night, all the men of Sodom, young and old, came from all over the city and surrounded the house."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"They shouted to Lot, “Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them!”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"“Please, my brothers,” he begged, “don’t do such a wicked thing."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Look, I have two virgin daughters. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do with them as you wish.
