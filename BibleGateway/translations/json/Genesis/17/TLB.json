In fact you shall be the father of not only one nation, but a multitude of nations!” Abram fell face downward in the dust as God talked with him."},{"num":5,"verse":"“What’s more,” God told him, “I am changing your name. It is no longer ‘Abram’ (‘Exalted Father’), but ‘Abraham’ (‘Father of Nations’)—for that is what you will be. I have declared it.

And I will be your God."},{"num":9,"verse":"“Your part of the contract,” God told him, “is to obey its terms. You personally and all your posterity have this continual responsibility: that every male among you shall be circumcised; "},{"num":11,"verse":"the foreskin of his penis shall be cut off. This will be the proof that you and they accept this covenant. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Every male shall be circumcised on the eighth day after birth.
