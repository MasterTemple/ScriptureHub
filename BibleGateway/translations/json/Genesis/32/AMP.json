"},{"num":4,"verse":"He commanded them, saying, “This is what to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says this, “I have been living temporarily with Laban, and have stayed there until now; "},{"num":5,"verse":"I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants; and I have sent [this message] to tell my lord, so that I may find grace and kindness in your sight.”’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps; "},{"num":8,"verse":"and he said, “If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the other camp which is left will escape.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the Lord, who said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your people, and I will make you prosper,’ "},{"num":10,"verse":"I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness and compassion and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant.
