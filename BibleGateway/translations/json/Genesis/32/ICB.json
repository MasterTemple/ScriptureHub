"},{"num":2,"verse":"When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So Jacob named that place Mahanaim."},{"num":3,"verse":"Jacob’s brother Esau was living in the area called Seir in the country of Edom. Jacob sent messengers to Esau. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Jacob told the messengers, “Give this message to my master Esau: ‘This is what Jacob, your servant, says: I have lived with Laban and have remained there until now. "},{"num":5,"verse":"I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants. I send this message to you and ask you to accept us.’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"The messengers returned to Jacob and said, “We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you. And he has 400 men with him.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then Jacob was very afraid and worried. He divided the people who were with him into two camps. He also divided all the flocks, herds and camels into two camps. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Jacob thought, “Esau might come and destroy one camp. But the other camp can run away and be saved.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham! God of my father Isaac! Lord, you told me to return to my country and my family. You said that you would do good to me. "},{"num":10,"verse":"I am not worthy of the kindness and continual goodness you have shown me. The first time I traveled across the Jordan River, I had only my walking stick. But now I own enough to have two camps. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Please save me from my brother Esau. I am afraid he will come and kill all of us, even the mothers with the children. "},{"num":12,"verse":"You said to me, ‘I will do good to you.

Then he said to them, “Go ahead of me and keep some space between each herd.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"Jacob gave them their orders. To the servant with the first group of animals he said, “My brother Esau will come to you. He will ask you, ‘Whose servant are you? Where are you going? Whose animals are these?’ "},{"num":18,"verse":"Then you will answer, ‘These animals belong to your servant Jacob. He sent them as a gift to you my master, Esau. And Jacob also is coming behind us.’”"},{"num":19,"verse":"Jacob ordered the second servant, the third servant and all the other servants to do the same thing. He said, “Say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’” Jacob thought, “If I send this gift ahead of me, maybe Esau will forgive me.

The sun is coming up.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"The man said to him, “What is your name?”"},{"num":28,"verse":"Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob. Your name will now be Israel, because you have wrestled with God and with men. And you have won.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"Then Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"So Jacob named that place Peniel. He said, “I have seen God face to face. But my life was saved.” "},{"num":31,"verse":"Then the sun rose as he was leaving that place. Jacob was limping because of his leg. "},{"num":32,"verse":"So even today the people of Israel do not eat the muscle that is on the hip joint of animals. This is because Jacob was touched there."}]
