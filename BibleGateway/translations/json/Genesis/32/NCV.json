I send this message to you and ask you to accept us.’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"The messengers returned to Jacob and said, “We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you and has four hundred men with him.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then Jacob was very afraid and worried. He divided the people who were with him and all the flocks, herds, and camels into two camps. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Jacob thought, “Esau might come and destroy one camp, but the other camp can run away and be saved.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham! God of my father Isaac! Lord, you told me to return to my country and my family. You said that you would treat me well. "},{"num":10,"verse":"I am not worthy of the kindness and continual goodness you have shown me. The first time I traveled across the Jordan River, I had only my walking stick, but now I own enough to have two camps. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Please save me from my brother Esau. I am afraid he will come and kill all of us, even the mothers with the children.

He said, “Say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
