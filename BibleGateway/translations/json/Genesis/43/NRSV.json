"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And when they had eaten up the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’ "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food; "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"but if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"They replied, “The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me, and let us be on our way, so that we may live and not die—you and we and also our little ones.

Then they went on their way down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph’s house. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Now the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph’s house, and they said, “It is because of the money, replaced in our sacks the first time, that we have been brought in, so that he may have an opportunity to fall upon us, to make slaves of us and take our donkeys.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So they went up to the steward of Joseph’s house and spoke with him at the entrance to the house.

God be gracious to you, my son!” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"With that, Joseph hurried out, because he was overcome with affection for his brother, and he was about to weep. So he went into a private room and wept there.
