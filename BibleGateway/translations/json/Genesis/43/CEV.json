So Jacob said to his sons, “Go back and buy some more grain.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Judah replied, “The governor strictly warned us that we would not be allowed to see him unless we brought our youngest brother with us. If you let us take Benjamin along, we will go and buy grain. But we won’t go without him!”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Jacob asked, “Why did you cause me so much trouble by telling the governor you had another brother?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"They answered, “He asked a lot of questions about us and our family. He wanted to know if you were still alive and if we had any more brothers. All we could do was answer his questions. How could we know he would tell us to bring along our brother?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Judah said to his father, “Let Benjamin go with me, and we will leave right away, so that none of us will starve to death. "},{"num":9,"verse":"I promise to bring him back safely, and if I don’t, you can blame me as long as I live.

"},{"num":21,"verse":"But when we stopped for the night, we each found in our grain sacks the exact amount we had paid. We have brought that money back, "},{"num":22,"verse":"together with enough money to buy more grain. We don’t know who put the money in our sacks.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"“It’s all right,” the servant replied. “Don’t worry. The God you and your father worship must have put the money there, because I received your payment in full.” Then he brought Simeon out to them."},{"num":24,"verse":"The servant took them into Joseph’s house and gave them water to wash their feet. He also tended their donkeys. "},{"num":25,"verse":"The brothers got their gifts ready to give to Joseph at noon, since they had heard they were going to eat there."},{"num":26,"verse":"When Joseph came home, they gave him the gifts they had brought, and they bowed down to him.

The Egyptians sat at yet another table, because Egyptians felt it was disgusting to eat with Hebrews. "},{"num":33,"verse":"To the surprise of Joseph’s brothers, they were seated in front of him according to their ages, from the oldest to the youngest. "},{"num":34,"verse":"They were served food from Joseph’s table, and Benjamin was given five times as much as each of the others. So Joseph’s brothers drank with him and had a good time."}]
