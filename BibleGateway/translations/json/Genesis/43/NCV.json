"},{"num":5,"verse":"But if you refuse to send Benjamin, we will not go. The governor of that country warned us that we would not see him if we didn’t bring Benjamin with us.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Israel said, “Why did you tell the man you had another brother? You have caused me a lot of trouble.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The brothers answered, “He questioned us carefully about ourselves and our family. He asked us, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ We just answered his questions. How could we know he would ask us to bring our other brother to him?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Judah said to his father Jacob, “Send Benjamin with me, and we will go at once so that we, you, and our children may live and not die.

We don’t know who put that money in our sacks.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"But the servant answered, “It’s all right. Don’t be afraid.

So Joseph went into his room and cried there. "},{"num":31,"verse":"Then he washed his face and came out. He controlled himself and said, “Serve the meal.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"So they served Joseph at one table, his brothers at another table, and the Egyptians who ate with him at another table.
