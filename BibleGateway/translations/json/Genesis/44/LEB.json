[{"header":"Joseph Tests His Brothers"},{"num":44,"verse":"Then he commanded the one who was over his household, saying, “Fill the sacks of the men with food as much as they are able to carry, and put each one’s money in the mouth of his sack. "},{"num":2,"verse":"And my cup—the cup of silver—you shall put into the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and the money for his grain. And he did according to the word of Joseph that he had commanded. "},{"num":3,"verse":"When the morning light came the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They went out of the city, and had not gone far when Joseph said to the one who was over his house, “Arise! Pursue after the men and overtake them. Then you shall say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Is this not that from which my master drinks? Now he himself certainly practices divination with it. You have done evil in what you have done.’” "},{"num":6,"verse":"When he overtook them he spoke these words to them. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And they said to him, “Why has my lord spoken according to these words? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! "},{"num":8,"verse":"Behold, the money that we found in the mouth of our sacks we returned to you from the land of Canaan. Now why would we steal silver or gold from the house of my lord? "},{"num":9,"verse":"Whoever is found with it from among your servants shall die. And moreover, we will become slaves to my lord.” "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then he said, “Now also according to your words, thus will it be.

"},{"num":15,"verse":"Then Joseph said to them, “What is this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man who is like me surely practices divination?” "},{"num":16,"verse":"And Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? Now how can we show ourselves innocent? God has found the guilt of your servants! Behold, we are slaves to my lord, both we and also he in whose hand the cup was found.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"But he said, “Far be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found, he will become my slave. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.” "},{"num":18,"verse":"But Judah drew near to him and said, “Please my lord, let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself.

"},{"num":28,"verse":"One went out from me, and I said, “Surely he must have been torn to pieces,” and I have never seen him since. "},{"num":29,"verse":"And if you take this one also from me, and he encounters harm, you will bring down my gray head in sorrow to Sheol.’ "},{"num":30,"verse":"So now, when I come to your servant, my father, and the boy is not with us—now his life is bound up with his life—"},{"num":31,"verse":"it shall happen that when he sees that the boy is gone, he will die. And your servants will bring down the gray head of your servant, our father, to Sheol with sorrow. "},{"num":32,"verse":"For your servant is pledged as surety for the boy by my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you, then I shall be culpable to my father forever. "},{"num":33,"verse":"So then, please let your servant remain in place of the boy as a slave to my lord, and let the boy go up with his brothers.
