[{"num":44,"verse":"Joseph commanded the manager of his house, “Fill the men’s bags with food, as much as they can carry. Put each man’s money into the mouth of his bag.

When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Isn’t this the cup that my lord drinks from and that he uses for divination? By doing this you have done evil.’” "},{"num":6,"verse":"The steward caught up to them and spoke those words to them."},{"num":7,"verse":"They replied to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Your servants would never do such a thing! "},{"num":8,"verse":"That money, which we found in the mouths of our bags—we brought it back to you from the land of Canaan. Why then would we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house?
