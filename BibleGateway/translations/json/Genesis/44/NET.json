"},{"num":4,"verse":"They had not gone very far from the city when Joseph said to the servant who was over his household, “Pursue the men at once! When you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Doesn’t my master drink from this cup and use it for divination? You have done wrong!’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"When the man overtook them, he spoke these words to them. "},{"num":7,"verse":"They answered him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! "},{"num":8,"verse":"Look, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan.
