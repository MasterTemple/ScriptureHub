"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then put my cup—the silver cup—in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the money for his grain.” He did as Joseph instructed."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When morning came, the men and their donkeys were sent off. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"They had not gone very far from the city when Joseph said to the servant who was over his household, “Pursue the men at once! When you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Doesn’t my master drink from this cup and use it for divination? You have done wrong!’”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When the man overtook them, he spoke these words to them. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"They answered him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Look, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. Why then would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If one of us has it, he will die, and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves!”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He replied, “You have suggested your own punishment!

Don’t you know that a man like me can find out things like this by divination?”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Judah replied, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? How can we clear ourselves? God has exposed the sin of your servants!

The man in whose hand the cup was found will become my slave, but the rest of you may go back to your father in peace.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then Judah approached him and said, “My lord, please allow your servant to speak a word with you. Please do not get angry with your servant, for you are just like Pharaoh. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"We said to my lord, ‘We have an aged father, and there is a young boy who was born when our father was old. The boy’s brother is dead.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Indeed, your servant pledged security for the boy with my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I will bear the blame before my father all my life.’"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"“So now, please let your servant remain as my lord’s slave instead of the boy. As for the boy, let him go back with his brothers. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I couldn’t bear to see my father’s pain.”"}]]
