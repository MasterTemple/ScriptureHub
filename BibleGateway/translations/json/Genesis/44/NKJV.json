"},{"num":3,"verse":"As soon as the morning dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. "},{"num":4,"verse":"When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Get up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Is not this the one from which my lord drinks, and with which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in so doing.’ ”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And they said to him, “Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Look, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house?

God has found out the iniquity of your servants; here we are, my lord’s slaves, both we and he also with whom the cup was found.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave.
