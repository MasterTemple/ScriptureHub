It is the one he drinks from, the one he uses for divination. You have committed a serious crime!’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"When the servant caught up with them, he repeated these words. "},{"num":7,"verse":"They answered him, “What do you mean, sir, by talking like this? We swear that we have done no such thing. "},{"num":8,"verse":"You know that we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found in the top of our sacks. Why then should we steal silver or gold from your master's house?
