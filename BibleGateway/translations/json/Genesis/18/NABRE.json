"},{"num":2,"verse":"Looking up, he saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to greet them; and bowing to the ground, "},{"num":3,"verse":"he said: “Sir, if it please you, do not go on past your servant. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Let some water be brought, that you may bathe your feet, and then rest under the tree. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Now that you have come to your servant, let me bring you a little food, that you may refresh yourselves; and afterward you may go on your way.” “Very well,” they replied, “do as you have said.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quick, three measures of bran flour! Knead it and make bread.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"He ran to the herd, picked out a tender, choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who quickly prepared it. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he got some curds and milk, as well as the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them, waiting on them under the tree while they ate."},{"num":9,"verse":"“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him. “There in the tent,” he replied. "},{"num":10,"verse":"One of them said, “I will return to you about this time next year, and Sarah will then have a son.” Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, just behind him. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years, and Sarah had stopped having her menstrual periods. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So Sarah laughed to herself and said, “Now that I am worn out and my husband is old, am I still to have sexual pleasure?” "},{"num":13,"verse":"But the Lord said to Abraham: “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really bear a child, old as I am?’ "},{"num":14,"verse":"Is anything too marvelous for the Lord to do?

"},{"num":20,"verse":"So the Lord said: The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great, and their sin so grave, "},{"num":21,"verse":"that I must go down to see whether or not their actions are as bad as the cry against them that comes to me. I mean to find out."},{"num":22,"verse":"As the men turned and walked on toward Sodom, Abraham remained standing before the Lord. "},{"num":23,"verse":"Then Abraham drew near and said: “Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? "},{"num":24,"verse":"Suppose there were fifty righteous people in the city; would you really sweep away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people within it? "},{"num":25,"verse":"Far be it from you to do such a thing, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike! Far be it from you!

"},{"num":32,"verse":"But he persisted: “Please, do not let my Lord be angry if I speak up this last time. What if ten are found there?” For the sake of the ten, he replied, I will not destroy it."},{"num":33,"verse":"The Lord departed as soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned home."}]
