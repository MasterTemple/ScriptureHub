"},{"num":4,"verse":"Let a little water be brought so that you may all wash your feet and rest under the tree. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And let me get a bit of food so that you may refresh yourselves since you have passed by your servant’s home. After that you may be on your way.” “All right,” they replied, “you may do as you say.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Take three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make bread.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"Then Abraham ran to the herd and chose a fine, tender calf, and gave it to a servant, who quickly prepared it. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Abraham then took some curds and milk, along with the calf that had been prepared, and placed the food before them.

"},{"num":12,"verse":"So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, “After I am worn out will I have pleasure, especially when my husband is old too?”"},{"num":13,"verse":"The Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child when I am old?’ "},{"num":14,"verse":"Is anything impossible for the Lord?
