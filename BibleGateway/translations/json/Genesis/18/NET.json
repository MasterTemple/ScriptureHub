"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Let a little water be brought so that you may all wash your feet and rest under the tree. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And let me get a bit of food so that you may refresh yourselves since you have passed by your servant’s home. After that you may be on your way.” “All right,” they replied, “you may do as you say.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick!
