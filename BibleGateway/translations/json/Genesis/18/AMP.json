[{"header":"Birth of Isaac Promised"},{"num":18,"verse":"Now the Lord appeared to Abraham by the terebinth trees of Mamre [in Hebron], while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. "},{"num":2,"verse":"When he raised his eyes and looked up, behold, three men were standing [a little distance] from him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down [with his face] to the ground, "},{"num":3,"verse":"and Abraham said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please do not pass by your servant [without stopping to visit]. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Please let a little water be brought [by one of my servants] and [you may] wash your feet, and recline and rest comfortably under the tree. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And I will bring a piece of bread to refresh and sustain you; after that you may go on, since you have come to your servant.” And they replied, “Do as you have said.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly, get ready three measures of fine meal, knead it and bake cakes.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"Abraham also ran to the herd and brought a calf, tender and choice, and he gave it to the servant [to butcher], and he hurried to prepare it. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before the men; and he stood beside them under the tree while they ate."},{"num":9,"verse":"Then they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” "},{"num":10,"verse":"He said, “I will surely return to you at this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in years; she was past [the age of] childbearing.

And He (the Lord) said, “No, but you did laugh.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"Then the men got up from there, and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham walked with them to send them on the way. "},{"num":17,"verse":"The Lord said, “Shall I keep secret from Abraham [My friend and servant] what I am going to do, "},{"num":18,"verse":"since Abraham is destined to become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him?
