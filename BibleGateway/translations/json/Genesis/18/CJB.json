[{"num":18,"verse":"Adonai appeared to Avraham by the oaks of Mamre as he sat at the entrance to the tent during the heat of the day. "},{"num":2,"verse":"He raised his eyes and looked, and there in front of him stood three men. On seeing them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, prostrated himself on the ground, "},{"num":3,"verse":"and said, “My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, please don’t leave your servant. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Please let me send for some water, so that you can wash your feet; then rest under the tree, "},{"num":5,"verse":"and I will bring a piece of bread. Now that you have come to your servant, refresh yourselves before going on.” “Very well,” they replied, “do what you have said.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Avraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, three measures of the best flour! Knead it and make cakes.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"Avraham ran to the herd, took a good, tender calf and gave it to the servant, who hurried to prepare it. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he took curds, milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it all before the men; and he stood by them under the tree as they ate.

"},{"num":11,"verse":"Avraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years; Sarah was past the age of childbearing. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, “I am old, and so is my lord; am I to have pleasure again?” "},{"num":13,"verse":"Adonai said to Avraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and ask, ‘Am I really going to bear a child when I am so old?’ "},{"num":14,"verse":"Is anything too hard for Adonai?

"},{"num":23,"verse":"Avraham approached and said, “Will you actually sweep away the righteous with the wicked? "},{"num":24,"verse":"Maybe there are fifty righteous people in the city; will you actually sweep the place away, and not forgive it for the sake of the fifty righteous who are there? "},{"num":25,"verse":"Far be it from you to do such a thing — to kill the righteous along with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike! Far be it from you!

What if twenty are found there?” He said, “For the sake of the twenty I won’t destroy it.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"He said, “I hope Adonai won’t be angry if I speak just once more. What if ten are found there?” He said, “For the sake of the ten I won’t destroy it.” "},{"num":33,"verse":"Adonai went on his way as soon as he had finished speaking to Avraham, and Avraham returned to his place."}]
