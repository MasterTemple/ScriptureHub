He said, ‘I’m going to make you prosperous and numerous, turn you into a congregation of tribes; and I’ll turn this land over to your children coming after you as a permanent inheritance.’ I’m adopting your two sons who were born to you here in Egypt before I joined you; they have equal status with Reuben and Simeon. But any children born after them are yours; they will come after their brothers in matters of inheritance. I want it this way because, as I was returning from Paddan, your mother Rachel, to my deep sorrow, died as we were on our way through Canaan when we were only a short distance from Ephrath, now called Bethlehem.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Just then Jacob noticed Joseph’s sons and said, “Who are these?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Joseph told his father, “They are my sons whom God gave to me in this place.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"Joseph took them from Israel’s knees and bowed respectfully, his face to the ground.
