Why don’t you water the sheep and goats so they can get back out to pasture?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"“We can’t water the animals until all the flocks have arrived,” they replied. “Then the shepherds move the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water all the sheep and goats.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Jacob was still talking with them when Rachel arrived with her father’s flock, for she was a shepherd."},{"num":10,"verse":"And because Rachel was his cousin—the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother—and because the sheep and goats belonged to his uncle Laban, Jacob went over to the well and moved the stone from its mouth and watered his uncle’s flock."},{"num":11,"verse":"Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and he wept aloud."},{"num":12,"verse":"He explained to Rachel that he was her cousin on her father’s side—the son of her aunt Rebekah.
