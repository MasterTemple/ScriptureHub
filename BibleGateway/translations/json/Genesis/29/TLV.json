"},{"num":2,"verse":"When he looked, suddenly, there was a well in the field, and there were three herds of sheep resting by it. (For from that well they would water the flocks. The stone on the mouth of the well was large. "},{"num":3,"verse":"When all the herds gathered there, they would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the flocks, and put the stone back to its place over the mouth of the well.)"},{"num":4,"verse":"Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So he said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s son?”"},{"num":6,"verse":"He said to them, “Is he well?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"He said, “Since it’s still the middle of the day, it’s not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the flock and let them go and graze.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"But they said, “We can’t, not until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled away from the mouth of the well—then we water the flock.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with the flock that belonged to her father (for she was a shepherdess). "},{"num":10,"verse":"Now when Jacob saw Rachel (the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother), Jacob stepped forward and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban, his mother’s brother. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Then Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative and that he was Rebekah’s son. So she ran and told her father."},{"num":13,"verse":"Now when Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, hugged and kissed him, and brought him to his house.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"Leah’s eyes were delicate, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.

Stay with me.” "},{"num":20,"verse":"So Jacob worked for Rachel seven years, yet in his eyes it was like a few days, because of his love for her."},{"num":21,"verse":"Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are completed, so I may go to her.” "},{"num":22,"verse":"So Laban gathered all the men of the place and he prepared a feast. "},{"num":23,"verse":"When it was evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to him, and he went to her. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Laban also gave her Zilpah his female servant to his daughter Leah as a female servant."},{"num":25,"verse":"So when it was morning, behold there she was, Leah! So he said to Laban, “What is this you’ve done to me? Wasn’t it for Rachel that I worked with you? So why have you deceived me?”"},{"num":26,"verse":"But Laban said, “It’s not done so in our place—to give the younger before the first-born.

Surely now my husband will love me.” "},{"num":33,"verse":"Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and said, “For Adonai heard that I am hated, so He’s given me this one also,” and she named him Simeon.
