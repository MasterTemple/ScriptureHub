I will be with you.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So Jacob sent a message for Rachel and Leah to come to the field where his flocks were. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"There he said to them, “I can tell that your father’s attitude toward me has changed, but the God of my father has been with me. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"You know that I’ve worked for your father as hard as I could, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"but your father has humiliated me and changed my wages ten times. But God has not permitted him to do me any harm. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If he said, ‘The speckled animals will be your wage,’ then the entire flock gave birth to speckled offspring.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Surely all the wealth that God snatched away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So now do everything God has told you.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So Jacob immediately put his children and his wives on the camels.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"I have the power to do you harm, but the God of your father told me last night, ‘Be careful that you neither bless nor curse Jacob.’ "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Now I understand that you have gone away because you longed desperately for your father’s house.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Whoever has taken your gods will be put to death! In the presence of our relatives identify whatever is yours and take it.” (Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.)"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So Laban entered Jacob’s tent, and Leah’s tent, and the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find the idols. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"(Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them inside her camel’s saddle and sat on them.) Laban searched the whole tent, but did not find them. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord.

Set it here before my relatives and yours, and let them settle the dispute between the two of us!"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"“I have been with you for the past twenty years. Your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.

You always made me pay for every missing animal, whether it was taken by day or at night. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"I was consumed by scorching heat during the day and by piercing cold at night, and I went without sleep. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"This was my lot for twenty years in your house: I worked like a slave for you—fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks—but you changed my wages ten times! "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If the God of my father—the God of Abraham, the one whom Isaac fears—had not been with me, you would certainly have sent me away empty-handed! But God saw how I was oppressed and how hard I worked, and he rebuked you last night.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Laban replied to Jacob, “These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks. All that you see belongs to me. But how can I harm these daughters of mine today or the children to whom they have given birth? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So now, come, let’s make a formal agreement, you and I, and it will be proof that we have made peace.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a memorial pillar.
