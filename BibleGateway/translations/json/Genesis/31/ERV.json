I will be with you.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"So Jacob told Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where he kept his flocks of sheep and goats."},{"num":5,"verse":"He said to them, “I have noticed that your father is not as friendly with me as he used to be. But the God of my father has been with me."},{"num":6,"verse":"You both know that I have worked as hard as I could for your father."},{"num":7,"verse":"But he cheated me. He has changed my pay ten times. But during all this time, God protected me from all of Laban’s tricks."},{"num":8,"verse":"“At one time Laban said, ‘You can keep all the goats with spots. This will be your pay.’ After he said this, all the animals gave birth to spotted goats, so they were all mine. But then Laban said, ‘I will keep the spotted goats. You can have all the striped goats. That will be your pay.’ After he said this, all the animals gave birth to striped goats."},{"num":9,"verse":"So God has taken the animals away from your father and has given them to me."},{"num":10,"verse":"“I had a dream during the time when the animals were mating.

Why did you take my daughters like they were women you captured during war?"},{"num":27,"verse":"Why did you run away without telling me? If you had told me, I would have given you a party. There would have been singing and dancing with music."},{"num":28,"verse":"You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You were very foolish to do this!"},{"num":29,"verse":"I have the power to really hurt you. But last night the God of your father came to me in a dream. He warned me not to hurt you in any way."},{"num":30,"verse":"I know that you want to go back to your home. That is why you left. But why did you steal the gods from my house?”"},{"num":31,"verse":"Jacob answered, “I left without telling you, because I was afraid. I thought you would take your daughters away from me."},{"num":32,"verse":"But I did not steal your gods. If you find anyone here with me who has taken your gods, they will be killed. Your men will be my witnesses. You can look for anything that belongs to you. Take anything that is yours.” (Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban’s gods.)"},{"num":33,"verse":"So Laban went and looked through Jacob’s camp. He looked in Jacob’s tent and then in Leah’s tent. Then he looked in the tent where the two slave women stayed, but he did not find the gods from his house.

What law have I broken? What right do you have to chase me and stop me?"},{"num":37,"verse":"You looked through everything I own and found nothing that belongs to you. If you found something, show it to me. Put it here where our men can see it. Let our men decide which one of us is right."},{"num":38,"verse":"I have worked 20 years for you. During all that time none of the baby sheep and goats died during birth. And I have not eaten any of the rams from your flocks."},{"num":39,"verse":"Any time a sheep was killed by wild animals, I always paid for the loss myself. I did not take the dead animal to you and say that it was not my fault. But I was robbed day and night."},{"num":40,"verse":"In the daytime the sun took away my strength, and at night sleep was taken from my eyes by the cold."},{"num":41,"verse":"I worked 20 years like a slave for you. For the first 14 years I worked to win your two daughters. The last six years I worked to earn your animals. And during that time you changed my pay ten times."},{"num":42,"verse":"But the God of my ancestors, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, was with me. If God had not been with me, you would have sent me away with nothing. But he saw the trouble that I had and the work that I did, and last night God proved that I am right.”"},{"header":"Jacob and Laban’s Treaty"},{"num":43,"verse":"Laban said to Jacob, “These women are my daughters. These children belong to me, and these animals are mine. Everything you see here belongs to me, but I can do nothing to keep my daughters and their children."},{"num":44,"verse":"So I am ready to make an agreement with you.
