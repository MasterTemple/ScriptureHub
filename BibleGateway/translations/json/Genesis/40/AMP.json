"},{"num":4,"verse":"The captain of the guard put Joseph in charge of them, and he served them; and they continued to be in custody for some time. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Then the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, both dreamed a dream in the same night, each man with his [own significant] dream and each dream with its [personal] interpretation. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When Joseph came to them in the morning and looked at them, [he saw that] they were sad and depressed. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in confinement with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so down-hearted today?” "},{"num":8,"verse":"And they said to him, “We have [each] dreamed [distinct] dreams and there is no one to interpret them.” So Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God?
