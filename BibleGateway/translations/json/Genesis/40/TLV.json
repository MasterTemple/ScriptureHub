"},{"num":4,"verse":"The commander of the bodyguards assigned Joseph to be with them and served them as their personal servant. They were in custody for some time."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then the two of them each dreamed a dream on the same night. The dream of each man—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison—each had its own interpretation. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When Joseph came to them in the morning, he observed them, and there they were, looking miserable. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in the custody of the house of his master saying, “Why are your faces so sad today?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"They said to him, “We dreamed a dream and there is no one to interpret it.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So the chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph, saying to him, “In my dream, suddenly, there was a vine in front of me.
