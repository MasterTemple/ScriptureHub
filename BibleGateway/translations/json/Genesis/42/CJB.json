[{"num":42,"verse":"Now Ya‘akov saw that there was grain in Egypt; so Ya‘akov said to his sons, “Why are you staring at each other? "},{"num":2,"verse":"Look,” he said, “I’ve heard that there’s grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us from there, so that we can stay alive and not die!” "},{"num":3,"verse":"Thus Yosef’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt, "},{"num":4,"verse":"except for Binyamin, Yosef’s brother. Ya‘akov did not send him with his brothers, because he was afraid something might happen to him."},{"num":5,"verse":"The sons of Isra’el came to buy along with the others that came, since the famine extended to the land of Kena‘an. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Yosef was governor over the land; it was he who sold to all the people of the land. Now when Yosef’s brothers came and prostrated themselves before him on the ground, "},{"num":7,"verse":"Yosef saw his brothers and recognized them; but he acted toward them as if he were a stranger and spoke harshly with them. He asked them, “Where are you from?” They answered, “From the land of Kena‘an to buy food.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"So Yosef recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him."},{"num":9,"verse":"Remembering the dreams he had had about them, Yosef said to them, “You are spies! You’ve come to spot our country’s weaknesses!” "},{"num":10,"verse":"“No, my lord,” they replied, “your servants have come to buy food. "},{"num":11,"verse":"We’re all the sons of one man, we’re upright men; your servants aren’t spies.” "},{"num":12,"verse":"“No,” he said to them, “you’ve come to spy out our country’s weaknesses.” "},{"num":13,"verse":"They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Kena‘an; the youngest stayed with our father, and another one is gone.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"“Just as I said,” replied Yosef, “you’re spies! "},{"num":15,"verse":"Here’s how you can prove you’re not lying: as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave here unless your youngest brother comes here. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Send one of you, and let him bring your brother. Meanwhile, you will be kept in custody. This will prove whether there is any truth in what you say. Otherwise, as Pharaoh lives, you are certainly spies.” "},{"num":17,"verse":"Then he put all of them together in prison for three days."},{"num":18,"verse":"On the third day, Yosef said to them, “Do what I say, and stay alive, for I fear God.

In this way your statements will be verified, and you won’t die.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"They said to each other, “We are in fact guilty concerning our brother.

When these things had been done for them, "},{"num":26,"verse":"they loaded their grain on their donkeys and departed."},{"num":27,"verse":"But at camp that night, as one of them opened his pack to give fodder to his donkey, he noticed his money — there it was, just inside his pack. "},{"num":28,"verse":"He said to his brothers, “My money has been restored — there it is, right in my pack!” At that, their hearts sank; they turned, trembling, to one another and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”"},{"num":29,"verse":"They returned to Ya‘akov their father in the land of Kena‘an and told him all that had happened to them.
