"},{"num":2,"verse":"These are the generations of Jacob."},{"num":3,"verse":"Now Israel (Jacob) loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a [distinctive] multicolored tunic. "},{"num":4,"verse":"His brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than all of his brothers; so they hated him and could not [find it within themselves to] speak to him on friendly terms."},{"num":5,"verse":"Now Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him even more. "},{"num":6,"verse":"He said to them, “Please listen to [the details of] this dream which I have dreamed; "},{"num":7,"verse":"we [brothers] were binding sheaves [of grain stalks] in the field, and lo, my sheaf [suddenly] got up and stood upright and remained standing; and behold, your sheaves stood all around my sheaf and bowed down [in respect].” "},{"num":8,"verse":"His brothers said to him, “Are you actually going to reign over us?

"},{"num":19,"verse":"They said to one another, “Look, here comes this dreamer. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Now then, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits (cisterns, underground water storage); then we will say [to our father], ‘A wild animal killed and devoured him’; and we shall see what will become of his dreams!” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Now Reuben [the eldest] heard this and rescued him from their hands and said, “Let us not take his life.” "},{"num":22,"verse":"Reuben said to them, “Do not shed his blood, but [instead] throw him [alive] into the pit that is here in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him [to kill him]”—[he said this so] that he could rescue him from them and return him [safely] to his father.
