It was at Chezib that she gave birth to him."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn; her name was Tamar. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD killed him [in judgment]. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then Judah told Onan, “Go in to your brother’s widow, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law [under the levirate marriage custom]; [be her husband and] raise children for [the name of] your brother.” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Onan knew that the child (heir) would not be his [but his dead brother’s]; so whenever he lay with his brother’s widow, he spilled his seed on the ground [to prevent conception], so that he would not give a child to his brother.
