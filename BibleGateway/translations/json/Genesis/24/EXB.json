[{"header":"A Wife for Isaac"},{"num":24,"verse":"Abraham was now very old, ·along in years [going in days], and the Lord had blessed him in every way. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Abraham said to his oldest servant [in his house], who was in charge of everything he owned, “Put your hand under my ·leg [thigh; a euphemism for male genitalia, expressing commitment to keep a promise]. "},{"num":3,"verse":"·Make a promise to me before [Swear to me by] the Lord, the God of heaven and [the God of] earth. Don’t get a wife for my son from the ·Canaanite girls [daughters of the Canaanites] who live around here. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Instead, go back to my country, to the land of my relatives, and get a wife for my son Isaac.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"The servant said to him, “·What if [Perhaps] this woman does not want to return with me to this land? Then, should I take your son with me back to your homeland?”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Abraham said to him, “No! ·Don’t take [Be careful not to take] my son back there. "},{"num":7,"verse":"The Lord, the God of heaven, brought me from the home of my father and the land of my relatives. And he ·promised [swore to] me, ‘I will give this land to your ·descendants [seed].’ The Lord will send his ·angel [messenger] before you to help you get a wife for my son there. "},{"num":8,"verse":"If the ·girl [woman] won’t come back with you, you will be ·free [declared innocent] from this promise. But you must not take my son back there.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"So the servant put his hand under his master’s ·leg [thigh; 24:2] and ·made a promise [swore] to Abraham about this."},{"num":10,"verse":"The servant took ten of Abraham’s camels and left, carrying with him many ·different kinds of beautiful gifts [goods of his master]. He went to ·northwestern Mesopotamia [Aram-Naharaim; a region near the Habor and Euphrates rivers, about a month’s journey away] to ·Nahor’s city [or the city of Nahor]. "},{"num":11,"verse":"In the evening, when the women come out to get water [most ancient towns had a single source of water for the community], he made the camels kneel down at the well outside the city."},{"num":12,"verse":"The servant said, “Lord, God of my master Abraham, ·allow me to find a wife for his son [grant me good fortune] today. Please show this ·kindness [loyalty] to my master Abraham. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Here I am, standing by the spring, and the ·girls [daughters of the men] from the city are coming out to get water. "},{"num":14,"verse":"·I will say to one of them [Let the girl to whom I will say…], ‘Please put your jar down so I can drink.’ Then let her say, ‘Drink, and I will also give water to your camels.’ If that happens, I will know she is the ·right one [the one appointed/selected] for your servant Isaac and that you have shown ·kindness [loyalty] to my master.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"Before the servant had finished ·praying [speaking], Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, came out of the city. (Bethuel was the son of Milcah and Nahor, Abraham’s brother [11:27–30].) Rebekah was carrying her water jar on her shoulder. "},{"num":16,"verse":"She was ·very pretty [extremely beautiful], a virgin; she had never ·had sexual relations with [known] a man. She went down to the spring and filled her jar, then came back up. "},{"num":17,"verse":"The servant ran to her and said, “Please give me a little ·water [sip] from your jar.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Rebekah said, “Drink, ·sir [my master].” She quickly lowered the jar ·from her shoulder [on her hand] and gave him a drink. "},{"num":19,"verse":"After ·he finished drinking [she let him drink all he wanted], Rebekah said, “I will also pour some water for your camels [until they have finished drinking].” "},{"num":20,"verse":"So she quickly ·poured [emptied] all the water from her jar into the drinking trough for the camels. Then she kept running to the well until she had given all the camels enough to drink."},{"num":21,"verse":"The ·servant [man] quietly ·watched [stared at] her. He wanted to ·be sure [learn whether or not] the Lord had made his trip successful. "},{"num":22,"verse":"After the camels had finished drinking, he gave Rebekah a gold ·ring [nose-ring; or earring] weighing ·one-fifth of an ounce [one half shekel] and two gold arm bracelets weighing about ·four ounces [ten shekels] each. "},{"num":23,"verse":"He asked, “·Who is your father [Tell me whose daughter you are]? Is there a place in his house for me and my men to spend the night?”"},{"num":24,"verse":"Rebekah answered, “·My father is [The daughter of] Bethuel, the son of Milcah and Nahor.” "},{"num":25,"verse":"Then she said, “And, yes, we have ·straw for your camels [plenty of straw and feed] and a place for you to spend the night.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"The servant bowed and worshiped the Lord "},{"num":27,"verse":"and said, “Blessed is the Lord, the God of my master Abraham. The Lord ·has been kind and truthful to him [has not abandoned his kindness/loyalty and truthfulness/faithfulness to my master] and has led me to my master’s relatives.”"},{"num":28,"verse":"Then Rebekah ran and told her mother’s family about all these things. "},{"num":29,"verse":"She had a brother named Laban, who ran out to Abraham’s servant, who was still at the spring. "},{"num":30,"verse":"Laban had heard what she had said and had seen the ·ring [nose-ring; or earring] and the bracelets on his sister’s arms. So he ran out to the well, and there was the man standing by the camels at the spring. "},{"num":31,"verse":"Laban said, “·Sir [O blessed one], ·you are welcome to come in [come]; ·you don’t have to stand [why are standing…?] outside. I have ·prepared [cleared out] the house for you and also a place for your camels.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"So Abraham’s servant went into the house. After Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and ·food [fodder], he gave water to Abraham’s servant so he and the men with him could wash their feet. "},{"num":33,"verse":"Then ·Laban gave the servant food [the food was set before him], but the servant said, “I will not eat until I have told you why I came.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"He said, “I am Abraham’s servant. "},{"num":35,"verse":"The Lord has greatly blessed my master in everything [12:3], and he has become a rich man. The Lord has given him many flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, camels, and horses. "},{"num":36,"verse":"Sarah, my master’s wife, gave birth to a son when she was old [21:1–7], and my master has given everything he owns to that son. "},{"num":37,"verse":"My master had me ·make a promise to him [swear] and said, ‘Don’t get a wife for my son from the Canaanite ·girls [daughters] ·who live around here [in whose land I live]. "},{"num":38,"verse":"Instead, you must go to my father’s ·people [house] and to my family. There you must ·get [take] a wife for my son.’ "},{"num":39,"verse":"I said to my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’ "},{"num":40,"verse":"But he said, ‘I ·serve [walk before] the Lord, who will send his ·angel [or messenger] with you and will ·help you [make your way successful]. You will ·get [take] a wife for my son from my family and my father’s ·people [house]. "},{"num":41,"verse":"Then you will be ·free [innocent] from ·the promise [my oath]. But if they will not give you a wife for my son, you will be ·free [innocent] from ·this promise [my oath].’"},{"num":42,"verse":"“Today I came to this spring. I said, ‘Lord, God of my master Abraham, please make my ·trip [way] successful. "},{"num":43,"verse":"I am standing by this spring. I will wait for a young woman to come out to ·get [draw] water, and I will say, “Please give me water from your jar to drink.” "},{"num":44,"verse":"Then let her say, “Drink this water, and I will also draw water for your camels.” By this I will know the Lord has chosen her for my master’s son.’"},{"num":45,"verse":"“Before I finished ·my silent prayer [speaking in my heart/mind], Rebekah came out of the city with her water jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ "},{"num":46,"verse":"She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink this. I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she watered my camels too. "},{"num":47,"verse":"When I asked her, ‘·Who is your father [Whose daughter are you]?’ she answered, ‘·My father is [The daughter of] Bethuel son of Milcah and Nahor.’ Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms, "},{"num":48,"verse":"and I bowed my head and ·thanked [worshipped] the Lord. I ·praised [blessed] the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, because he ·led [guided] me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son. "},{"num":49,"verse":"Now, tell me, will you be ·kind [loyal] and ·truthful [faithful] to my master? And if not, tell me so. Then I will ·know what I should do [turn to the right hand or to the left].”"},{"num":50,"verse":"Laban and Bethuel answered, “This ·is clearly [has come out] from the Lord, and we cannot ·change what must happen [speak to you good or evil]. "},{"num":51,"verse":"Rebekah is ·yours [before you]. Take her and go. Let her marry your master’s son as the Lord has ·commanded [spoken].”"},{"num":52,"verse":"When Abraham’s servant heard these words, he bowed facedown on the ground before the Lord. "},{"num":53,"verse":"Then he gave Rebekah gold and silver jewelry and clothes. He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and mother. "},{"num":54,"verse":"The servant and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, the servant said, “·Now let me go [Send me] back to my master.”"},{"num":55,"verse":"Rebekah’s mother and her brother said, “Let ·Rebekah [the girl] stay with us at least ten days. After that she may go.”"},{"num":56,"verse":"But the servant said to them, “Do not ·make me wait [delay/hinder], because the Lord has made my ·trip [way] successful. Now ·let me go [send me] back to my master.”"},{"num":57,"verse":"Rebekah’s brother and mother said, “We will call Rebekah and ask her ·what she wants to do [at her mouth].” "},{"num":58,"verse":"They called her and asked her, “Do you want to go with this man now?”"},{"num":59,"verse":"So they ·allowed Rebekah and her nurse to go [sent Rebekah their sister and her nurse] with Abraham’s servant and his men. "},{"num":60,"verse":"They blessed Rebekah and said,"},{"num":61,"verse":"Then Rebekah and her servant girls ·got on [rose up and mounted] the camels and followed the servant and his men. So the servant took Rebekah and left."},{"num":62,"verse":"At this time Isaac had left Beer Lahai Roi [16:14] and was living in ·southern Canaan [Negev].
