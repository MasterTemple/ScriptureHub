Bring her here to him.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"The servant said to him, “Maybe this woman will not want to come back with me to this land. If that happens, should I take your son with me to your homeland?”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Abraham said to him, “No, don’t take my son to that place."},{"num":7,"verse":"The Lord, the God of heaven, brought me from my homeland to this place.

There the man was, standing by the camels at the well."},{"num":31,"verse":"Laban said, “Sir, you are welcome to come in! You don’t have to stand outside here. I have prepared a room for you to sleep in and a place for your camels.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"So Abraham’s servant went into the house. Laban unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed.

Go to my family and choose a wife for my son.’"},{"num":39,"verse":"I said to my master, ‘Maybe the woman will not come back to this place with me.’"},{"num":40,"verse":"But my master said to me, ‘I serve the Lord, and he will send his angel with you and help you. You will find a wife for my son among my people there."},{"num":41,"verse":"But if you go to my father’s country, and they refuse to give you a wife for my son, you will be free from this promise.’"},{"num":42,"verse":"“Today I came to this well and said, ‘Lord, God of my master Abraham, please make my trip successful."},{"num":43,"verse":"I will stand by this well and wait for a young woman to come to get water. Then I will say, “Please give me water from your jar to drink.”"},{"num":44,"verse":"The right woman will answer in a special way.
