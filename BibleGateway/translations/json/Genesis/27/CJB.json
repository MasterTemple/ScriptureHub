[{"num":27,"verse":"In the course of time, after Yitz’chak had grown old and his eyes dim, so that he couldn’t see, he called ‘Esav his older son and said to him, “My son?” and he answered, “Here I am.” "},{"num":2,"verse":"“Look, I’m old now, I don’t know when I will die. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Therefore, please take your hunting gear — your quiver of arrows and your bow; go out in the country, and get me some game. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Make it tasty, the way I like it; and bring it to me to eat. Then I will bless you [as firstborn], before I die.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Rivkah was listening when Yitz’chak spoke to his son ‘Esav. So when ‘Esav went out to the country to hunt for game and bring it back, "},{"num":6,"verse":"she said to her son Ya‘akov, “Listen! I heard your father telling ‘Esav your brother, "},{"num":7,"verse":"‘Bring me game, and make it tasty, so I can eat it. Then I will give you my blessing in the presence of Adonai, before my death.’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"Now pay attention to me, my son; and do what I tell you. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Go to the flock, and bring me back two choice kids. I will make it tasty for your father, the way he likes it; "},{"num":10,"verse":"and you will bring it to your father to eat; so that he will give his blessing to you before his death.” "},{"num":11,"verse":"Ya‘akov answered Rivkah his mother, “Look, ‘Esav is hairy, but I have smooth skin. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Suppose my father touches me — he’ll know I’m trying to trick him, and I’ll bring a curse on myself, not a blessing!” "},{"num":13,"verse":"But his mother said, “Let your curse be on me. Just listen to me, and go get me the kids!” "},{"num":14,"verse":"So he went, got them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared them in the tasty way his father loved. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Next, Rivkah took ‘Esav her older son’s best clothes, which she had with her in the house, and put them on Ya‘akov her younger son; "},{"num":16,"verse":"and she put the skins of the goats on his hands and on the smooth parts of his neck. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Then she gave the tasty food and the bread she had prepared to her son Ya‘akov."},{"num":18,"verse":"He went to his father and said, “My father?” He replied, “Here I am; who are you, my son?” "},{"num":19,"verse":"Ya‘akov said to his father, “I am ‘Esav your firstborn. I’ve done what you asked me to do. Get up now, sit down, eat the game, and then give me your blessing.” "},{"num":20,"verse":"Yitz’chak said to his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “Adonai your God made it happen that way.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Yitz’chak said to Ya‘akov, “Come here, close to me, so I can touch you, my son, and know whether you are in fact my son ‘Esav or not.” "},{"num":22,"verse":"Ya‘akov approached Yitz’chak his father, who touched him and said, “The voice is Ya‘akov’s voice, but the hands are ‘Esav’s hands.” "},{"num":23,"verse":"However, he didn’t detect him; because his hands were hairy like his brother ‘Esav’s hands; so he gave him his blessing. "},{"num":24,"verse":"He asked, “Are you really my son ‘Esav?” And he replied, “I am.” "},{"num":25,"verse":"He said, “Bring it here to me, and I will eat my son’s game, so that I can give you my blessing.” So he brought it up to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine, and he drank.

Yitz’chak smelled his clothes and blessed Ya‘akov with these words: “See, my son smells like a field which Adonai has blessed.

May you be lord over your kinsmen, let your mother’s descendants bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you!”"},{"num":30,"verse":"But as soon as Yitz’chak had finished giving his blessing to Ya‘akov, when Ya‘akov had barely left his father’s presence, ‘Esav his brother came in from his hunting.

I ate it all just before you came, and I gave my blessing to him. That’s the truth, and the blessing must stand.” "},{"num":34,"verse":"When ‘Esav heard his father’s words he burst into loud, bitter sobbing. “Father, bless me too,” he begged. "},{"num":35,"verse":"He replied, “Your brother came deceitfully and took away your blessing.” "},{"num":36,"verse":"‘Esav said, “His name, Ya‘akov [he supplants], really suits him — because he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright, and here, now he has taken away my blessing!” Then he asked, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?” "},{"num":37,"verse":"Yitz’chak answered ‘Esav, “Look, I have made him your lord, I have given him all his kinsmen as servants, and I have given him grain and wine to sustain him.
