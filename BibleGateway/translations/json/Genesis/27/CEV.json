"},{"num":3,"verse":"So take your bow and arrows, then go out in the fields, and kill a wild animal. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Cook some of that tasty food that I love so much and bring it to me. I want to eat it once more and give you my blessing before I die.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Rebekah had been listening, and as soon as Esau left to go hunting, "},{"num":6,"verse":"she said to Jacob, “I heard your father tell Esau "},{"num":7,"verse":"to kill a wild animal and cook some tasty food for your father before he dies. Your father said this because he wants to bless your brother with the Lord as his witness. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Now, my son, listen carefully to what I want you to do. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Go and kill two of your best young goats and bring them to me. I’ll cook the tasty food that your father loves so much. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then you can take it to him, so he can eat it and give you his blessing before he dies.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"“My brother Esau is a hairy man,” Jacob reminded her. “And I am not. "},{"num":12,"verse":"If my father touches me and realizes I am trying to trick him, he will put a curse on me instead of giving me a blessing.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Rebekah insisted, “Let his curse fall on me! Just do what I say and bring me the meat.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"So Jacob brought the meat to his mother, and she cooked the tasty food that his father liked.
