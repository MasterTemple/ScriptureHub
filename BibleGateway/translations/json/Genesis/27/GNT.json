"},{"num":3,"verse":"Take your bow and arrows, go out into the country, and kill an animal for me. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Cook me some of that tasty food that I like, and bring it to me. After I have eaten it, I will give you my final blessing before I die.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"While Isaac was talking to Esau, Rebecca was listening. So when Esau went out to hunt, "},{"num":6,"verse":"she said to Jacob, “I have just heard your father say to Esau, "},{"num":7,"verse":"‘Bring me an animal and cook it for me. After I have eaten it, I will give you my blessing in the presence of the Lord before I die.’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"Now, son,” Rebecca continued, “listen to me and do what I say. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Go to the flock and pick out two fat young goats, so that I can cook them and make some of that food your father likes so much. "},{"num":10,"verse":"You can take it to him to eat, and he will give you his blessing before he dies.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"But Jacob said to his mother, “You know that Esau is a hairy man, but I have smooth skin. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Perhaps my father will touch me and find out that I am deceiving him; in this way, I will bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"His mother answered, “Let any curse against you fall on me, my son; just do as I say, and go and get the goats for me.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"So he went to get them and brought them to her, and she cooked the kind of food that his father liked. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Then she took Esau's best clothes, which she kept in the house, and put them on Jacob.

He was about to give him his blessing, "},{"num":24,"verse":"but asked again, “Are you really Esau?”"},{"num":25,"verse":"Isaac said, “Bring me some of the meat. After I eat it, I will give you my blessing.” Jacob brought it to him, and he also brought him some wine to drink.
