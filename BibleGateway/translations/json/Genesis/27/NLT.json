Then I will pronounce the blessing that belongs to you, my firstborn son, before I die.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"But Rebekah overheard what Isaac had said to his son Esau.

Bless me, too!” he begged."},{"num":35,"verse":"But Isaac said, “Your brother was here, and he tricked me. He has taken away your blessing.”"},{"num":36,"verse":"Esau exclaimed, “No wonder his name is Jacob, for now he has cheated me twice. First he took my rights as the firstborn, and now he has stolen my blessing. Oh, haven’t you saved even one blessing for me?”"},{"num":37,"verse":"Isaac said to Esau, “I have made Jacob your master and have declared that all his brothers will be his servants. I have guaranteed him an abundance of grain and wine—what is left for me to give you, my son?”"},{"num":38,"verse":"Esau pleaded, “But do you have only one blessing? Oh my father, bless me, too!” Then Esau broke down and wept."},{"num":39,"verse":"Finally, his father, Isaac, said to him, "},{"header":"Jacob Flees to Paddan-Aram"},{"num":41,"verse":"From that time on, Esau hated Jacob because their father had given Jacob the blessing.
