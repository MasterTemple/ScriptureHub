[{"num":7,"verse":"After this, Yeshua traveled around in the Galil, intentionally avoiding Y’hudah because the Judeans were out to kill him. "},{"num":2,"verse":"But the festival of Sukkot in Y’hudah was near; "},{"num":3,"verse":"so his brothers said to him, “Leave here and go into Y’hudah, so that your talmidim can see the miracles you do; "},{"num":4,"verse":"for no one who wants to become known acts in secret. If you’re doing these things, show yourself to the world!” "},{"num":5,"verse":"(His brothers spoke this way because they had not put their trust in him.) "},{"num":6,"verse":"Yeshua said to them, “My time has not yet come; but for you, any time is right. "},{"num":7,"verse":"The world can’t hate you, but it does hate me, because I keep telling it how wicked its ways are. "},{"num":8,"verse":"You, go on up to the festival; as for me, I am not going up to this festival now, because the right time for me has not yet come.” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Having said this, he stayed on in the Galil."},{"num":10,"verse":"But after his brothers had gone up to the festival, he too went up, not publicly but in secret. "},{"num":11,"verse":"At the festival, the Judeans were looking for him. “Where is he?” they asked. "},{"num":12,"verse":"And among the crowds there was much whispering about him. Some said, “He’s a good man”; but others said, “No, he is deceiving the masses.” "},{"num":13,"verse":"However, no one spoke about him openly, for fear of the Judeans."},{"num":14,"verse":"Not until the festival was half over did Yeshua go up to the Temple courts and begin to teach. "},{"num":15,"verse":"The Judeans were surprised: “How does this man know so much without having studied?” they asked.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"If anyone wants to do his will, he will know whether my teaching is from God or I speak on my own. "},{"num":18,"verse":"A person who speaks on his own is trying to win praise for himself; but a person who tries to win praise for the one who sent him is honest, there is nothing false about him.

Why are you out to kill me?” "},{"num":20,"verse":"“You have a demon!” the crowd answered. “Who’s out to kill you?” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Yeshua answered them, “I did one thing; and because of this, all of you are amazed. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Moshe gave you b’rit-milah — not that it came from Moshe but from the Patriarchs — and you do a boy’s b’rit-milah on Shabbat.

"},{"num":26,"verse":"Yet here he is, speaking openly; and they don’t say anything to him. It couldn’t be, could it, that the authorities have actually concluded he’s the Messiah? "},{"num":27,"verse":"Surely not — we know where this man comes from; but when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he comes from.” "},{"num":28,"verse":"Whereupon Yeshua, continuing to teach in the Temple courts, cried out, “Indeed you do know me!

Does he intend to go to the Greek Diaspora and teach the Greek-speaking Jews? "},{"num":36,"verse":"And when he says, ‘You will look for me and not find me; indeed, where I am, you cannot come’ — what does he mean?”"},{"num":37,"verse":"Now on the last day of the festival, Hoshana Rabbah, Yeshua stood and cried out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him keep coming to me and drinking!
