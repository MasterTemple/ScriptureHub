Others have worked hard, and you have joined in their work.”"},{"num":39,"verse":"Many of the Samaritans from that town put their trust in Him because of the word of the woman testifying, “He told me everything I ever did!” "},{"num":40,"verse":"So when the Samaritans came to Him, they kept asking Him to stay with them. He stayed there two days, "},{"num":41,"verse":"and many more believed because of His word. "},{"num":42,"verse":"They kept telling the woman, “It’s no longer because of your words that we believe.
