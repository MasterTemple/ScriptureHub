But what good is that with this huge crowd?”"},{"num":10,"verse":"“Tell everyone to sit down,” Jesus said. So they all sat down on the grassy slopes. (The men alone numbered about 5,000.)"},{"num":11,"verse":"Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks to God, and distributed them to the people. Afterward he did the same with the fish. And they all ate as much as they wanted."},{"num":12,"verse":"After everyone was full, Jesus told his disciples, “Now gather the leftovers, so that nothing is wasted.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"So they picked up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with scraps left by the people who had eaten from the five barley loaves."},{"num":14,"verse":"When the people saw him do this miraculous sign, they exclaimed, “Surely, he is the Prophet we have been expecting!”"},{"num":15,"verse":"When Jesus saw that they were ready to force him to be their king, he slipped away into the hills by himself."},{"header":"Jesus Walks on Water"},{"num":16,"verse":"That evening Jesus’ disciples went down to the shore to wait for him."},{"num":17,"verse":"But as darkness fell and Jesus still hadn’t come back, they got into the boat and headed across the lake toward Capernaum."},{"num":18,"verse":"Soon a gale swept down upon them, and the sea grew very rough."},{"num":19,"verse":"They had rowed three or four miles when suddenly they saw Jesus walking on the water toward the boat.
