So he turned to Philip and said, “Where will we buy enough food to feed all these people?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"Now Jesus already knew what he was about to do, but he said this to stretch Philip’s faith."},{"num":7,"verse":"Philip answered, “Well, I suppose if we were to give everyone only a snack, it would cost thousands of dollars to buy enough food!”"},{"num":8,"verse":"But just then, Andrew, Peter’s brother, spoke up and said, "},{"num":9,"verse":"“Look! Here’s a young person with five barley loaves and two small fish . . . but how far would that go with this huge crowd?”"},{"num":10,"verse":"“Have everyone sit down,” Jesus said to his disciples. So on the vast grassy slope, more than five thousand hungry people sat down. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Jesus then took the barley loaves and the fish and gave thanks to God. He then gave it to the disciples to distribute to the people. Miraculously, the food multiplied, with everyone eating as much as they wanted!"},{"num":12,"verse":"When everyone was satisfied, Jesus told his disciples, “Now go back and gather up the pieces left over so that nothing will be wasted.” "},{"num":13,"verse":"The disciples filled up twelve baskets of fragments, a basket of leftovers for each disciple."},{"num":14,"verse":"All the people were astounded as they saw with their own eyes the incredible miracle Jesus had performed! They began to say among themselves, “He really is the One—the true prophet we’ve been expecting!”"},{"num":15,"verse":"So Jesus, knowing that they were about to take him and make him their king by force, quickly left and went up the mountainside alone."},{"header":"Jesus Walks on Water"},{"num":16,"verse":"After waiting until evening for Jesus to return, the disciples went down to the lake. But as darkness fell, he still hadn’t returned, so the disciples got into a boat and headed across the lake to Capernaum. "},{"num":18,"verse":"By now a strong wind began to blow and was stirring up the waters. "},{"num":19,"verse":"The disciples had rowed about halfway across the lake when all of a sudden they caught sight of Jesus walking on top of the waves, coming toward them.

"},{"num":27,"verse":"Why would you strive for food that is perishable and not be passionate to seek the food of eternal life, which never spoils? I, the Son of Man, am ready to give you what matters most, for God the Father has destined me for this purpose.”"},{"num":28,"verse":"They replied, “So what should we do if we want to do God’s work?”"},{"num":29,"verse":"Jesus answered, “The work you can do for God starts with believing in the One he has sent.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"They replied, “Show us a miracle so we can see it, and then we’ll believe in you. Moses took care of our ancestors who were fed by the miracle of manna every day in the desert, just like the Scripture says, ‘He fed them with bread from heaven.’ What sign will you perform for us?”"},{"num":32,"verse":"“The truth is,” Jesus said, “Moses didn’t give you the bread of heaven. It’s my Father who offers bread that comes as a dramatic sign from heaven.
