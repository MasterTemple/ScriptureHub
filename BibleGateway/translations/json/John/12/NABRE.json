[{"header":"Chapter 12"},{"num":1,"verse":"The Anointing at Bethany. Six days before Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. "},{"num":2,"verse":"They gave a dinner for him there, and Martha served, while Lazarus was one of those reclining at table with him. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Mary took a liter of costly perfumed oil made from genuine aromatic nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and dried them with her hair; the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then Judas the Iscariot, one [of] his disciples, and the one who would betray him, said, "},{"num":5,"verse":"“Why was this oil not sold for three hundred days’ wages and given to the poor?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"He said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief and held the money bag and used to steal the contributions. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Let her keep this for the day of my burial. "},{"num":8,"verse":"You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"[The] large crowd of the Jews found out that he was there and came, not only because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. "},{"num":10,"verse":"And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too, "},{"num":11,"verse":"because many of the Jews were turning away and believing in Jesus because of him."},{"num":12,"verse":"On the next day, when the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, "},{"num":13,"verse":"they took palm branches and went out to meet him, and cried out:"},{"num":14,"verse":"Jesus found an ass and sat upon it, as is written:"},{"num":16,"verse":"His disciples did not understand this at first, but when Jesus had been glorified they remembered that these things were written about him and that they had done this for him. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from death continued to testify. "},{"num":18,"verse":"This was [also] why the crowd went to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign. "},{"num":19,"verse":"So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the whole world has gone after him.”"},{"num":20,"verse":"Now there were some Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the feast. "},{"num":21,"verse":"They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.” "},{"num":22,"verse":"Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. "},{"num":23,"verse":"Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Amen, amen, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains just a grain of wheat; but if it dies, it produces much fruit. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life.

"},{"num":31,"verse":"Now is the time of judgment on this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. "},{"num":32,"verse":"And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself.” "},{"num":33,"verse":"He said this indicating the kind of death he would die. "},{"num":34,"verse":"So the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. Then how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” "},{"num":35,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “The light will be among you only a little while. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overcome you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where he is going.
