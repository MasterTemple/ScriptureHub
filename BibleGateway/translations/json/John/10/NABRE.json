[{"header":"Chapter 10"},{"num":1,"verse":"The Good Shepherd. “Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever does not enter a sheepfold through the gate but climbs over elsewhere is a thief and a robber. "},{"num":2,"verse":"But whoever enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The gatekeeper opens it for him, and the sheep hear his voice, as he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. "},{"num":4,"verse":"When he has driven out all his own, he walks ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, because they recognize his voice. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But they will not follow a stranger; they will run away from him, because they do not recognize the voice of strangers.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"Although Jesus used this figure of speech, they did not realize what he was trying to tell them."},{"num":7,"verse":"So Jesus said again, “Amen, amen, I say to you, I am the gate for the sheep. "},{"num":8,"verse":"All who came [before me] are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. "},{"num":9,"verse":"I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture. "},{"num":10,"verse":"A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and destroy; I came so that they might have life and have it more abundantly. "},{"num":11,"verse":"I am the good shepherd. A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. "},{"num":12,"verse":"A hired man, who is not a shepherd and whose sheep are not his own, sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away, and the wolf catches and scatters them. "},{"num":13,"verse":"This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep. "},{"num":14,"verse":"I am the good shepherd, and I know mine and mine know me, "},{"num":15,"verse":"just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I will lay down my life for the sheep. "},{"num":16,"verse":"I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. These also I must lead, and they will hear my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd. "},{"num":17,"verse":"This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again. "},{"num":18,"verse":"No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have power to lay it down, and power to take it up again. This command I have received from my Father.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"Again there was a division among the Jews because of these words. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Many of them said, “He is possessed and out of his mind; why listen to him?” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Others said, “These are not the words of one possessed; surely a demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Feast of the Dedication. The feast of the Dedication was then taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter. "},{"num":23,"verse":"And Jesus walked about in the temple area on the Portico of Solomon. "},{"num":24,"verse":"So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.” "},{"num":25,"verse":"Jesus answered them, “I told you and you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify to me. "},{"num":26,"verse":"But you do not believe, because you are not among my sheep. "},{"num":27,"verse":"My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me. "},{"num":28,"verse":"I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish. No one can take them out of my hand. "},{"num":29,"verse":"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can take them out of the Father’s hand. "},{"num":30,"verse":"The Father and I are one.”"},{"num":31,"verse":"The Jews again picked up rocks to stone him. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of these are you trying to stone me?” "},{"num":33,"verse":"The Jews answered him, “We are not stoning you for a good work but for blasphemy. You, a man, are making yourself God.” "},{"num":34,"verse":"Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods”’? "},{"num":35,"verse":"If it calls them gods to whom the word of God came, and scripture cannot be set aside, "},{"num":36,"verse":"can you say that the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world blasphemes because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? "},{"num":37,"verse":"If I do not perform my Father’s works, do not believe me; "},{"num":38,"verse":"but if I perform them, even if you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may realize [and understand] that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.” "},{"num":39,"verse":"[Then] they tried again to arrest him; but he escaped from their power."},{"num":40,"verse":"He went back across the Jordan to the place where John first baptized, and there he remained. "},{"num":41,"verse":"Many came to him and said, “John performed no sign, but everything John said about this man was true.” "},{"num":42,"verse":"And many there began to believe in him."}]
