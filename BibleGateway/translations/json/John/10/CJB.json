[{"num":10,"verse":"“Yes, indeed! I tell you, the person who doesn’t enter the sheep-pen through the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber. "},{"num":2,"verse":"But the one who goes in through the gate is the sheep’s own shepherd. "},{"num":3,"verse":"This is the one the gate-keeper admits, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep, each one by name, and leads them out. "},{"num":4,"verse":"After taking out all that are his own, he goes on ahead of them; and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They never follow a stranger but will run away from him, because strangers’ voices are unfamiliar to them.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Yeshua used this indirect manner of speaking with them, but they didn’t understand what he was talking to them about. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So Yeshua said to them again, “Yes, indeed! I tell you that I am the gate for the sheep. "},{"num":8,"verse":"All those who have come before me have been thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them. "},{"num":9,"verse":"I am the gate; if someone enters through me, he will be safe and will go in and out and find pasture. "},{"num":10,"verse":"The thief comes only in order to steal, kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, life in its fullest measure."},{"num":11,"verse":"“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"The hired worker behaves like this because that’s all he is, a hired worker; so it doesn’t matter to him what happens to the sheep. "},{"num":14,"verse":"I am the good shepherd; I know my own, and my own know me — "},{"num":15,"verse":"just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father — and I lay down my life on behalf of the sheep. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Also I have other sheep which are not from this pen; I need to bring them, and they will hear my voice; and there will be one flock, one shepherd."},{"num":17,"verse":"“This is why the Father loves me: because I lay down my life — in order to take it up again!

This is what my Father commanded me to do.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"Again there was a split among the Judeans because of what he said. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Many of them said, “He has a demon!” and “He’s meshugga! Why do you listen to him?” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Others said, “These are not the deeds of a man who is demonized — how can a demon open blind people’s eyes?”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Then came Hanukkah in Yerushalayim. It was winter, "},{"num":23,"verse":"and Yeshua was walking around inside the Temple area, in Shlomo’s Colonnade.

They will absolutely never be destroyed, and no one will snatch them from my hands.
