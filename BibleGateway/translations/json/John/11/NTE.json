It’s all about the glory of God! The son of God will be glorified through it.’"},{"num":5,"verse":"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. "},{"num":6,"verse":"So when he heard that he was ill, he stayed where he was, to begin with, for two days."},{"num":7,"verse":"Then, after that, he said to the disciples, ‘Let’s go back to Judaea.’"},{"num":8,"verse":"‘Teacher,’ replied the disciples, ‘the Judaeans were trying to stone you just now! Surely you don’t want to go back there!’"},{"num":9,"verse":"‘There are twelve hours in the day, aren’t there?’ replied Jesus. ‘If you walk in the day, you won’t trip up, because you’ll see the light of this world. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But if anyone walks in the night, they will trip up, because there is no light in them.’"},{"num":11,"verse":"When he had said this, Jesus added: ‘Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep.

Couldn’t he have done something to stop this fellow from dying?’"},{"header":"The Raising of Lazarus"},{"num":38,"verse":"Jesus was once again deeply troubled within himself. He came to the tomb.
