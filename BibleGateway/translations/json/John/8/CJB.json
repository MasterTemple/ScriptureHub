[{"num":8,"verse":"But Yeshua went to the Mount of Olives. "},{"num":2,"verse":"At daybreak, he appeared again in the Temple Court, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The Torah-teachers and the P’rushim brought in a woman who had been caught committing adultery and made her stand in the center of the group. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then they said to him, “Rabbi, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Now in our Torah, Moshe commanded that such a woman be stoned to death. What do you say about it?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"They said this to trap him, so that they might have ground for bringing charges against him; but Yeshua bent down and began writing in the dust with his finger. "},{"num":7,"verse":"When they kept questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “The one of you who is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he bent down and wrote in the dust again. "},{"num":9,"verse":"On hearing this, they began to leave, one by one, the older ones first, until he was left alone, with the woman still there. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Standing up, Yeshua said to her, “Where are they? Has no one condemned you?” "},{"num":11,"verse":"She said, “No one, sir.” Yeshua said, “Neither do I condemn you. Now go, and don’t sin any more.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"Yeshua spoke to them again: “I am the light of the world; whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light which gives life.” "},{"num":13,"verse":"So the P’rushim said to him, “Now you’re testifying on your own behalf; your testimony is not valid.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"Yeshua answered them, “Even if I do testify on my own behalf, my testimony is indeed valid; because I know where I came from and where I’m going; but you do not know where I came from or where I’m going. "},{"num":15,"verse":"You judge by merely human standards. As for me, I pass judgment on no one; "},{"num":16,"verse":"but if I were indeed to pass judgment, my judgment would be valid; because it is not I alone who judge, but I and the One who sent me. "},{"num":17,"verse":"And even in your Torah it is written that the testimony of two people is valid. "},{"num":18,"verse":"I myself testify on my own behalf, and so does the Father who sent me.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"They said to him, “Where is this ‘father’ of yours?” Yeshua answered, “You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father too.” "},{"num":20,"verse":"He said these things when he was teaching in the Temple treasury room; yet no one arrested him, because his time had not yet come."},{"num":21,"verse":"Again he told them, “I am going away, and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin — where I am going, you cannot come.” "},{"num":22,"verse":"The Judeans said, “Is he going to commit suicide? Is that what he means when he says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?” "},{"num":23,"verse":"Yeshua said to them, “You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. "},{"num":24,"verse":"This is why I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not trust that I AM [who I say I am], you will die in your sins.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"At this, they said to him, “You? Who are you?” Yeshua answered, “Just what I’ve been telling you from the start. "},{"num":26,"verse":"There are many things I could say about you, and many judgments I could make. However, the One who sent me is true; so I say in the world only what I have heard from him.” "},{"num":27,"verse":"They did not understand that he was talking to them about the Father. "},{"num":28,"verse":"So Yeshua said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM [who I say I am], and that of myself I do nothing, but say only what the Father has taught me. "},{"num":29,"verse":"Also, the One who sent me is still with me; he did not leave me to myself, because I always do what pleases him.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Many people who heard him say these things trusted in him. "},{"num":31,"verse":"So Yeshua said to the Judeans who had trusted him, “If you obey what I say, then you are really my talmidim, "},{"num":32,"verse":"you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” "},{"num":33,"verse":"They answered, “We are the seed of Avraham and have never been slaves to anyone; so what do you mean by saying, ‘You will be set free’?” "},{"num":34,"verse":"Yeshua answered them, “Yes, indeed! I tell you that everyone who practices sin is a slave of sin. "},{"num":35,"verse":"Now a slave does not remain with a family forever, but a son does remain with it forever. "},{"num":36,"verse":"So if the Son frees you, you will really be free! "},{"num":37,"verse":"I know you are the seed of Avraham. Yet you are out to kill me, because what I am saying makes no headway in you. "},{"num":38,"verse":"I say what my Father has shown me; you do what your father has told you!”"},{"num":39,"verse":"They answered him, “Our father is Avraham.” Yeshua replied, “If you are children of Avraham, then do the things Avraham did! "},{"num":40,"verse":"As it is, you are out to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Avraham did nothing like that! "},{"num":41,"verse":"You are doing the things your father does.” “We’re not illegitimate children!” they said to him. “We have only one Father — God!” "},{"num":42,"verse":"Yeshua replied to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me; because I came out from God; and now I have arrived here. I did not come on my own; he sent me. "},{"num":43,"verse":"Why don’t you understand what I’m saying? Because you can’t bear to listen to my message. "},{"num":44,"verse":"You belong to your father, Satan, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. From the start he was a murderer, and he has never stood by the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he is speaking in character; because he is a liar — indeed, the inventor of the lie! "},{"num":45,"verse":"But as for me, because I tell the truth you don’t believe me. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Which one of you can show me where I’m wrong? If I’m telling the truth, why don’t you believe me? "},{"num":47,"verse":"Whoever belongs to God listens to what God says; the reason you don’t listen is that you don’t belong to God.”"},{"num":48,"verse":"The Judeans answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying you are from Shomron and have a demon?” "},{"num":49,"verse":"Yeshua replied, “Me? I have no demon. I am honoring my Father. But you dishonor me. "},{"num":50,"verse":"I am not seeking praise for myself. There is One who is seeking it, and he is the judge. "},{"num":51,"verse":"Yes, indeed! I tell you that whoever obeys my teaching will never see death.”"},{"num":52,"verse":"The Judeans said to him, “Now we know for sure that you have a demon! Avraham died, and so did the prophets; yet you say, ‘Whoever obeys my teaching will never taste death.’ "},{"num":53,"verse":"Avraham avinu died; you aren’t greater than he, are you? And the prophets also died. Who do you think you are?” "},{"num":54,"verse":"Yeshua answered, “If I praise myself, my praise counts for nothing. The One who is praising me is my Father, the very one about whom you keep saying, ‘He is our God.’ "},{"num":55,"verse":"Now you have not known him, but I do know him; indeed, if I were to say that I don’t know him, I would be a liar like you! But I do know him, and I obey his word. "},{"num":56,"verse":"Avraham, your father, was glad that he would see my day; then he saw it and was overjoyed.”"},{"num":57,"verse":"“Why, you’re not yet fifty years old,” the Judeans replied, “and you have seen Avraham?” "},{"num":58,"verse":"Yeshua said to them, “Yes, indeed! Before Avraham came into being, I AM!” "},{"num":59,"verse":"At this, they picked up stones to throw at him; but Yeshua was hidden and left the Temple grounds."}]
