[{"header":"Chapter 8"},{"num":53,"verse":"A Woman Caught in Adultery. [Then each went to his own house, "},{"num":1,"verse":"while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. "},{"num":2,"verse":"But early in the morning he arrived again in the temple area, and all the people started coming to him, and he sat down and taught them. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They said to him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"They said this to test him, so that they could have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But when they continued asking him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Again he bent down and wrote on the ground. "},{"num":9,"verse":"And in response, they went away one by one, beginning with the elders. So he was left alone with the woman before him. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then Jesus straightened up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” "},{"num":11,"verse":"She replied, “No one, sir.” Then Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, [and] from now on do not sin any more.”]"},{"num":12,"verse":"Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” "},{"num":13,"verse":"So the Pharisees said to him, “You testify on your own behalf, so your testimony cannot be verified.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I do testify on my own behalf, my testimony can be verified, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going. "},{"num":15,"verse":"You judge by appearances, but I do not judge anyone. "},{"num":16,"verse":"And even if I should judge, my judgment is valid, because I am not alone, but it is I and the Father who sent me. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men can be verified. "},{"num":18,"verse":"I testify on my behalf and so does the Father who sent me.” "},{"num":19,"verse":"So they said to him, “Where is your father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.” "},{"num":20,"verse":"He spoke these words while teaching in the treasury in the temple area. But no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come."},{"num":21,"verse":"He said to them again, “I am going away and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come.” "},{"num":22,"verse":"So the Jews said, “He is not going to kill himself, is he, because he said, ‘Where I am going you cannot come’?” "},{"num":23,"verse":"He said to them, “You belong to what is below, I belong to what is above. You belong to this world, but I do not belong to this world. "},{"num":24,"verse":"That is why I told you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins.” "},{"num":25,"verse":"So they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “What I told you from the beginning. "},{"num":26,"verse":"I have much to say about you in condemnation. But the one who sent me is true, and what I heard from him I tell the world.” "},{"num":27,"verse":"They did not realize that he was speaking to them of the Father. "},{"num":28,"verse":"So Jesus said [to them], “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will realize that I AM, and that I do nothing on my own, but I say only what the Father taught me. "},{"num":29,"verse":"The one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him.” "},{"num":30,"verse":"Because he spoke this way, many came to believe in him."},{"num":31,"verse":"Jesus then said to those Jews who believed in him, “If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples, "},{"num":32,"verse":"and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” "},{"num":33,"verse":"They answered him, “We are descendants of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How can you say, ‘You will become free’?” "},{"num":34,"verse":"Jesus answered them, “Amen, amen, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. "},{"num":35,"verse":"A slave does not remain in a household forever, but a son always remains. "},{"num":36,"verse":"So if a son frees you, then you will truly be free. "},{"num":37,"verse":"I know that you are descendants of Abraham. But you are trying to kill me, because my word has no room among you. "},{"num":38,"verse":"I tell you what I have seen in the Father’s presence; then do what you have heard from the Father.”"},{"num":39,"verse":"They answered and said to him, “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would be doing the works of Abraham. "},{"num":40,"verse":"But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God; Abraham did not do this. "},{"num":41,"verse":"You are doing the works of your father!” [So] they said to him, “We are not illegitimate. We have one Father, God.” "},{"num":42,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and am here; I did not come on my own, but he sent me. "},{"num":43,"verse":"Why do you not understand what I am saying? Because you cannot bear to hear my word. "},{"num":44,"verse":"You belong to your father the devil and you willingly carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks in character, because he is a liar and the father of lies. "},{"num":45,"verse":"But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Can any of you charge me with sin? If I am telling the truth, why do you not believe me? "},{"num":47,"verse":"Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not listen, because you do not belong to God.”"},{"num":48,"verse":"The Jews answered and said to him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed?” "},{"num":49,"verse":"Jesus answered, “I am not possessed; I honor my Father, but you dishonor me. "},{"num":50,"verse":"I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the one who judges. "},{"num":51,"verse":"Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever keeps my word will never see death.” "},{"num":52,"verse":"[So] the Jews said to him, “Now we are sure that you are possessed. Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, ‘Whoever keeps my word will never taste death.’ "},{"num":53,"verse":"Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? Or the prophets, who died? Who do you make yourself out to be?” "},{"num":54,"verse":"Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is worth nothing; but it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’ "},{"num":55,"verse":"You do not know him, but I know him. And if I should say that I do not know him, I would be like you a liar. But I do know him and I keep his word. "},{"num":56,"verse":"Abraham your father rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad. "},{"num":57,"verse":"So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old and you have seen Abraham?” "},{"num":58,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “Amen, amen, I say to you, before Abraham came to be, I AM.” "},{"num":59,"verse":"So they picked up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid and went out of the temple area."}]
