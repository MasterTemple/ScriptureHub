They made her stand in the middle of the court and put the case before Him."},{"num":4,"verse":"Teacher, they said, This woman has been caught in the very act of adultery."},{"num":5,"verse":"Now Moses in the Law commanded us that such [women—offenders] shall be stoned to death. But what do You say [to do with her—what is Your sentence]?"},{"num":6,"verse":"This they said to try (test) Him, hoping they might find a charge on which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger."},{"num":7,"verse":"However, when they persisted with their question, He raised Himself up and said, Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her."},{"num":8,"verse":"Then He bent down and went on writing on the ground with His finger."},{"num":9,"verse":"They listened to Him, and then they began going out, conscience-stricken, one by one, from the oldest down to the last one of them, till Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing there before Him in the center of the court."},{"num":10,"verse":"When Jesus raised Himself up, He said to her, Woman, where are your accusers? Has no man condemned you?"},{"num":11,"verse":"She answered, No one, Lord! And Jesus said, I do not condemn you either. Go on your way and from now on sin no more."},{"num":12,"verse":"Once more Jesus addressed the crowd. He said, I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me will not be walking in the dark, but will have the Light which is Life."},{"num":13,"verse":"Whereupon the Pharisees told Him, You are testifying on Your own behalf; Your testimony is not valid and is worthless."},{"num":14,"verse":"Jesus answered, Even if I do testify on My own behalf, My testimony is true and reliable and valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going."},{"num":15,"verse":"You [set yourselves up to] judge according to the flesh (by what you see). [You condemn by external, human standards.] I do not [set Myself up to] judge or condemn or sentence anyone."},{"num":16,"verse":"Yet even if I do judge, My judgment is true [My decision is right]; for I am not alone [in making it], but [there are two of Us] I and the Father, Who sent Me."},{"num":17,"verse":"In your [own] Law it is written that the testimony (evidence) of two persons is reliable and valid."},{"num":18,"verse":"I am One [of the Two] bearing testimony concerning Myself; and My Father, Who sent Me, He also testifies about Me."},{"num":19,"verse":"Then they said to Him, Where is this Father of Yours?

Jesus said, If you were [truly] Abraham’s children, then you would do the works of Abraham [follow his example, do as Abraham did]."},{"num":40,"verse":"But now [instead] you are wanting and seeking to kill Me, a Man Who has told you the truth which I have heard from God. This is not the way Abraham acted."},{"num":41,"verse":"You are doing the works of your [own] father. They said to Him, We are not illegitimate children and born out of fornication; we have one Father, even God."},{"num":42,"verse":"Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me and respect Me and welcome Me gladly, for I proceeded (came forth) from God [out of His very presence]. I did not even come on My own authority or of My own accord (as self-appointed); but He sent Me."},{"num":43,"verse":"Why do you misunderstand what I say? It is because you are unable to hear what I am saying.

Then if I speak truth, why do you not believe Me [trust Me, rely on, and adhere to Me]?"},{"num":47,"verse":"Whoever is of God listens to God. [Those who belong to God hear the words of God.] This is the reason that you do not listen [to those words, to Me]: because you do not belong to God and are not of God or in harmony with Him."},{"num":48,"verse":"The Jews answered Him, Are we not right when we say You are a Samaritan and that You have a demon [that You are under the power of an evil spirit]?"},{"num":49,"verse":"Jesus answered, I am not possessed by a demon. On the contrary, I honor and reverence My Father and you dishonor (despise, vilify, and scorn) Me."},{"num":50,"verse":"However, I am not in search of honor for Myself. [I do not seek and am not aiming for My own glory.] There is One Who [looks after that; He] seeks [My glory], and He is the Judge."},{"num":51,"verse":"I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, if anyone observes My teaching [lives in accordance with My message, keeps My word], he will by no means ever see and experience death."},{"num":52,"verse":"The Jews said to Him, Now we know that You are under the power of a demon (insane). Abraham died, and also the prophets, yet You say, If a man keeps My word, he will never taste of death into all eternity."},{"num":53,"verse":"Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, and all the prophets died! Who do You make Yourself out to be?"},{"num":54,"verse":"Jesus answered, If I were to glorify Myself (magnify, praise, and honor Myself), I would have no real glory, for My glory would be nothing and worthless. [My honor must come to Me from My Father.] It is My Father Who glorifies Me [Who extols Me, magnifies, and praises Me], of Whom you say that He is your God."},{"num":55,"verse":"Yet you do not know Him or recognize Him and are not acquainted with Him, but I know Him. If I should say that I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you.
