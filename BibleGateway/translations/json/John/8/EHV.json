[{"header":"The Adulteress"},{"num":8,"verse":"But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Early in the morning, he came back into the temple courts.

"},{"num":4,"verse":"“Teacher,” they said to him, “this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery. "},{"num":5,"verse":"In the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"They asked this to test him, so that they might have evidence to accuse him."},{"num":7,"verse":"But when they kept on asking him for an answer, he stood up and said to them, “Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he stooped down again and wrote on the ground."},{"num":9,"verse":"When they heard this, they went away one by one, beginning with the older men.

Your testimony is not valid.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"“Even if I testify about myself,” Jesus replied, “my testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going. "},{"num":15,"verse":"You judge according to the flesh. I am not judging anyone. "},{"num":16,"verse":"But even if I were to judge, my judgment would be true, because I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.

Where I am going, you cannot come.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"So the Jews asked, “He won’t kill himself, will he, because he says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”"},{"num":23,"verse":"“You are from below,” he told them. “I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world. "},{"num":24,"verse":"That is why I told you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am the one, you will die in your sins.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"“Who are you?” they asked."},{"num":26,"verse":"I have many things to say and to judge concerning you. But the one who sent me is true.

Indeed, I have not come on my own, but he sent me. "},{"num":43,"verse":"Why do you not understand my message? It is because you are not able to listen to my word. "},{"num":44,"verse":"You belong to your father, the Devil, and you want to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and did not remain standing in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he speaks from what is his, because he is a liar and the father of lying. "},{"num":45,"verse":"But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Who of you can convict me of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me? "},{"num":47,"verse":"Whoever belongs to God listens to what God says. The reason you do not listen is that you do not belong to God.”"},{"num":48,"verse":"The Jews responded, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”"},{"num":49,"verse":"Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon. On the contrary, I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. "},{"num":50,"verse":"I do not seek my own glory. There is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.

If I said, ‘I do not know him,’ I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I hold on to his word. "},{"num":56,"verse":"Your father Abraham was glad that he would see my day. He saw it and rejoiced.”"},{"num":57,"verse":"The Jews replied, “You aren’t even fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?”"},{"num":58,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “Amen, Amen, I tell you: Before Abraham was born, I am.” "},{"num":59,"verse":"Then they picked up stones to throw at him.
