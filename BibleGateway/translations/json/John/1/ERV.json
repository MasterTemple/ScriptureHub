But the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘You will see the Spirit come down and rest on a man. He is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen this happen.

He asked, “What do you want?”"},{"num":39,"verse":"He answered, “Come with me and you will see.” So the two men went with him. They saw the place where he was staying, and they stayed there with him that day. It was about four o’clock."},{"num":40,"verse":"These men followed Jesus after they had heard about him from John.
