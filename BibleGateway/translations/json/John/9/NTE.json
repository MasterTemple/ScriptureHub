Did he sin, or did his parents?’"},{"num":3,"verse":"‘He didn’t sin,’ replied Jesus, ‘nor did his parents. It happened so that God’s works could be seen in him. "},{"num":4,"verse":"We must work the works of the one who sent me as long as it’s still daytime. The night is coming, and nobody can work then!

So they called the parents of the newly sighted man, "},{"num":19,"verse":"and put the question to them."},{"num":20,"verse":"‘Well,’ replied his parents, ‘we know that he is indeed our son, and that he was born blind.

He can speak for himself.’"},{"num":22,"verse":"His parents said this because they were afraid of the Judaeans. The Judaeans, you see, had already decided that if anyone declared that Jesus was the Messiah, they should be put out of the synagogue.
