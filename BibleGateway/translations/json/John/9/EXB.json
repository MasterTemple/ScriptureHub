[{"header":"Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind"},{"num":9,"verse":"As Jesus ·was walking along [passed by; went along], he saw a man who had been born blind. "},{"num":2,"verse":"His ·followers [disciples] asked him, “·Teacher [Rabbi], whose sin caused this man to be born blind—his own sin or his parents’ sin?” [The disciples, like the friends of Job, viewed suffering as the result of a person’s own sins.]"},{"num":3,"verse":"Jesus answered, “It is not this man’s sin or his parents’ sin that made him blind. This man was born blind so that God’s ·power [works] could be ·shown [displayed; revealed; manifest] in him. "},{"num":4,"verse":"While it is daytime, we must continue doing the work of the One who sent me. Night is coming [Jesus’ death], when no one can work. "},{"num":5,"verse":"While I am in the world, I am the light of the world [see 8:12].”"},{"num":6,"verse":"After Jesus said this, he spit on the ground and made some mud with ·it [the saliva] and ·put [spread; anointed] the mud on the man’s eyes [the significance of the mud made with spit is unclear]. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Then he told the man, “Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam.” (Siloam [from a Hebrew word] means Sent.) So the man went, washed, and came back seeing."},{"num":8,"verse":"The neighbors and some people who had earlier seen this man begging said, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Some said, “He is the one,” but others said, “No, he only looks like him.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"[Therefore] They asked him, “How [then] ·did you get your sight [were your eyes opened]?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"He answered, “The man named Jesus made some mud and ·put [spread; anointed] it on my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"They asked him, “Where is this man?”"},{"header":"Pharisees Question the Healing"},{"num":13,"verse":"Then the people took to the Pharisees [a religious party which strictly observed OT laws and later customs] the man who had been blind. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day [on which no work was allowed]. "},{"num":15,"verse":"So now the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you get your sight?”"},{"num":16,"verse":"So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man does not keep the Sabbath day [according to rabbinic tradition neither kneading nor healing were permitted on the Sabbath], so he is not from God.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"[Therefore; So; Then] They asked the man again, “What do you say about him, since it was your eyes he opened?”"},{"num":18,"verse":"·These leaders [The Jews; the Pharisees] did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again. So they sent for the ·man’s parents [parents of the man who could now see] "},{"num":19,"verse":"and asked them, “Is this your son who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”"},{"num":20,"verse":"[Therefore; So] His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. "},{"num":21,"verse":"But we don’t know how he can now see. We don’t know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself [of legal age to give testimony].” "},{"num":22,"verse":"His parents said this because they were afraid of the ·elders [Jewish leaders; Jews], who had already decided that anyone who ·said [confessed; acknowledged] Jesus was the ·Christ [Messiah] would be ·avoided [put out of the synagogue; an act of expulsion or excommunication]. "},{"num":23,"verse":"That is why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"So for the second time, they called the man who had been blind. They said, “·You should give God the glory by telling the truth [Give God the glory; see Josh. 7:19 where this phrase is a command to tell the truth]. We know that this man is a sinner.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"[So; Then] He answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"[So; Then] They asked, “What did he do to you? How did he ·make you see again [open your eyes]?”"},{"num":27,"verse":"He answered them, “I already told you, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his ·followers [disciples] too?”"},{"num":28,"verse":"Then they ·insulted [ridiculed; reviled] him and said, “You are his ·follower [disciple], but we are ·followers [disciples] of Moses. "},{"num":29,"verse":"We know that God spoke to Moses [Ex. 33:11; Num. 12:8; Deut. 34:10], but we don’t even know where this man comes from.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"The man answered, “This is a very ·strange [astonishing; marvelous] thing. You don’t know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. "},{"num":31,"verse":"We all know that God does not listen to sinners, but he listens to anyone who ·worships [is devout; is godfearing] and ·obeys him [does his will]. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Nobody has ·ever [or since the beginning of the world; from the age/eternity] heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind. "},{"num":33,"verse":"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"They answered, “You were born ·full of sin [or in utter sinfulness]! Are you trying to teach us?” And they threw him out [of the synagogue; an act of excommunication]."},{"header":"Spiritual Blindness"},{"num":35,"verse":"When Jesus heard that they had ·thrown [cast; driven] him out [of the synagogue], Jesus found him and said, “Do you ·believe [trust] in the Son of Man [a title for the Messiah; Dan. 7:13–14]?”"},{"num":36,"verse":"He asked, “Who is ·the Son of Man [he], sir, so that I can ·believe [trust] in him?”"},{"num":37,"verse":"Jesus said to him, “You have seen him. ·The Son of Man [He] is the one talking with you.”"},{"num":38,"verse":"He said, “·Lord [the same word is rendered “sir” in v. 36, but here may have a more solemn sense], I ·believe [trust]!” Then the man ·worshiped [prostrated himself before] Jesus."},{"num":39,"verse":"Jesus said, “I came into this world ·so that the world could be judged [for judgment]. I came so that the blind would see and so that those who see will become blind.” [Those who acknowledge they are spiritually blind will see the truth; and those who think they see spiritually (the Jewish religious leaders) are actually blind; Is. 6:10; 42:19.]"},{"num":40,"verse":"Some of the Pharisees who were nearby heard Jesus say this and asked, “Are you saying we are blind, too?”"},{"num":41,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin. But since you keep saying you see, your ·guilt [or sin] remains.”"}]
