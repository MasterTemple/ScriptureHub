"},{"num":17,"verse":"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him. "},{"num":18,"verse":"The one who believes in him is not condemned. The one who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.
