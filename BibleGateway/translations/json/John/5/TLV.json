[{"header":"Healing on Shabbat"},{"num":5,"verse":"After this there was a Jewish feast, and Yeshua went up to Jerusalem.

He can do only what He sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise. "},{"num":20,"verse":"For the Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He does.
