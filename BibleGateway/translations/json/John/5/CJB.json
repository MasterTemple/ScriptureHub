[{"num":5,"verse":"After this, there was a Judean festival; and Yeshua went up to Yerushalayim. "},{"num":2,"verse":"In Yerushalayim, by the Sheep Gate, is a pool called in Aramaic, Beit-Zata, "},{"num":3,"verse":"in which lay a crowd of invalids — blind, lame, crippled. "},{"num":4,"verse":" "},{"num":5,"verse":"One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Yeshua, seeing this man and knowing that he had been there a long time, said to him, “Do you want to be healed?” "},{"num":7,"verse":"The sick man answered, “I have no one to put me in the pool when the water is disturbed; and while I’m trying to get there, someone goes in ahead of me.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Yeshua said to him, “Get up, pick up your mat and walk!” "},{"num":9,"verse":"Immediately the man was healed, and he picked up his mat and walked."},{"num":10,"verse":"so the Judeans said to the man who had been healed, “It’s Shabbat! It’s against Torah for you to carry your mat!” "},{"num":11,"verse":"But he answered them, “The man who healed me — he’s the one who told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’” "},{"num":12,"verse":"They asked him, “Who is the man who told you to pick it up and walk?” "},{"num":13,"verse":"But the man who had been healed didn’t know who it was, because Yeshua had slipped away into the crowd."},{"num":14,"verse":"Afterwards Yeshua found him in the Temple court and said to him, “See, you are well! Now stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you!” "},{"num":15,"verse":"The man went off and told the Judeans it was Yeshua who had healed him; "},{"num":16,"verse":"and on account of this, the Judeans began harassing Yeshua because he did these things on Shabbat."},{"num":17,"verse":"But he answered them, “My Father has been working until now, and I too am working.” "},{"num":18,"verse":"This answer made the Judeans all the more intent on killing him — not only was he breaking Shabbat; but also, by saying that God was his own Father, he was claiming equality with God. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Therefore, Yeshua said this to them: “Yes, indeed! I tell you that the Son cannot do anything on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does too. "},{"num":20,"verse":"For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does; and he will show him even greater things than these, so that you will be amazed. "},{"num":21,"verse":"Just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive, so too the Son makes alive anyone he wants. "},{"num":22,"verse":"The Father does not judge anyone but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, "},{"num":23,"verse":"so that all may honor the Son as they honor the Father. Whoever fails to honor the Son is not honoring the Father who sent him. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Yes, indeed! I tell you that whoever hears what I am saying and trusts the One who sent me has eternal life — that is, he will not come up for judgment but has already crossed over from death to life! "},{"num":25,"verse":"Yes, indeed! I tell you that there is coming a time — in fact, it’s already here — when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who listen will come to life. "},{"num":26,"verse":"For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has given the Son life to have in himself. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Also he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. "},{"num":28,"verse":"Don’t be surprised at this; because the time is coming when all who are in the grave will hear his voice "},{"num":29,"verse":"and come out — those who have done good to a resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to a resurrection of judgment. "},{"num":30,"verse":"I can’t do a thing on my own. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is right; because I don’t seek my own desire, but the desire of the one who sent me."},{"num":31,"verse":"“If I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is not valid. "},{"num":32,"verse":"But there is someone else testifying on my behalf, and I know that the testimony he is making is valid — "},{"num":33,"verse":"you have sent to Yochanan, and he has testified to the truth. "},{"num":34,"verse":"Not that I collect human testimony; rather, I say these things so that you might be saved. "},{"num":35,"verse":"He was a lamp burning and shining, and for a little while you were willing to bask in his light."},{"num":36,"verse":"“But I have a testimony that is greater than Yochanan’s. For the things the Father has given me to do, the very things I am doing now, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me."},{"num":37,"verse":"“In addition, the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. But you have never heard his voice or seen his shape; "},{"num":38,"verse":"moreover, his word does not stay in you, because you don’t trust the one he sent. "},{"num":39,"verse":"You keep examining the Tanakh because you think that in it you have eternal life. Those very Scriptures bear witness to me, "},{"num":40,"verse":"but you won’t come to me in order to have life!"},{"num":41,"verse":"“I don’t collect praise from men, "},{"num":42,"verse":"but I do know you people — I know that you have no love for God in you! "},{"num":43,"verse":"I have come in my Father’s name, and you don’t accept me; if someone else comes in his own name, him you will accept. "},{"num":44,"verse":"How can you trust? You’re busy collecting praise from each other, instead of seeking praise from God only."},{"num":45,"verse":"“But don’t think that it is I who will be your accuser before the Father. Do you know who will accuse you? Moshe, the very one you have counted on! "},{"num":46,"verse":"For if you really believed Moshe, you would believe me; because it was about me that he wrote. "},{"num":47,"verse":"But if you don’t believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?”"}]
