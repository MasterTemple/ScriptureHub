Some of them were blind, some were crippled, and some were paralyzed."},{"num":4,"verse":""},{"num":5,"verse":"One of the men lying there had been sick for 38 years."},{"num":6,"verse":"Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been sick for a very long time. So he asked him, “Do you want to be well?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"The sick man answered, “Sir, there is no one to help me get into the water when it starts moving. I try to be the first one into the water. But when I try, someone else always goes in before I can.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Jesus said, “Stand up! Pick up your mat and walk.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Immediately the man was well. He picked up his mat and started walking."},{"num":10,"verse":"So some Jews said to the man who had been healed, “Today is the Sabbath. It is against our law for you to carry your mat on the Sabbath day.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”"},{"num":12,"verse":"They asked him, “Who is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk?”"},{"num":13,"verse":"But the man who had been healed did not know who it was. There were many people there, and Jesus had left."},{"num":14,"verse":"Later, Jesus found the man at the Temple and said to him, “See, you are well now. But stop sinning or something worse may happen to you!”"},{"num":15,"verse":"Then the man left and went back to the Jews who questioned him.

But the Father will show the Son greater things than this to do. Then you will all be amazed."},{"num":21,"verse":"The Father raises the dead and gives them life. In the same way, the Son gives life to those he wants to."},{"num":22,"verse":"“Also, the Father judges no one. He has given the Son power to do all the judging."},{"num":23,"verse":"God did this so that all people will respect the Son the same as they respect the Father.

I want only to please the one who sent me."},{"header":"Jesus Says More to the Jewish Leaders"},{"num":31,"verse":"“If I tell people about myself, they cannot be sure that what I say is true."},{"num":32,"verse":"But there is someone else who tells people about me, and I know that what he says about me is true."},{"num":33,"verse":"“You sent men to John, and he told you what is true."},{"num":34,"verse":"I don’t need anyone to tell people about me, but I remind you of what John said so that you can be saved."},{"num":35,"verse":"John was like a lamp that burned and gave light, and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while."},{"num":36,"verse":"“But I have a proof about myself that is greater than anything John said. The things I do are my proof. These are what my Father gave me to do. They show that the Father sent me."},{"num":37,"verse":"And the Father who sent me has given proof about me himself. But you have never heard his voice. You have never seen what he looks like."},{"num":38,"verse":"The Father’s teaching does not live in you, because you don’t believe in the one the Father sent."},{"num":39,"verse":"You carefully study the Scriptures.
