Then he dressed in sackcloth, covered his head with ashes, and walked through the city, wailing loudly and bitterly, "},{"num":2,"verse":"until he came to the entrance of the palace. He did not go in because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Throughout all the provinces, wherever the king's proclamation was made known, there was loud mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, wailed, and most of them put on sackcloth and lay in ashes."},{"num":4,"verse":"When Esther's servant women and eunuchs told her what Mordecai was doing, she was deeply disturbed. She sent Mordecai some clothes to put on instead of the sackcloth, but he would not accept them.

If I must die for doing it, I will die.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"Mordecai then left and did everything that Esther had told him to do."}]
