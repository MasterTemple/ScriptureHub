"},{"num":2,"verse":"All the ·royal officers [king’s ministers; officials] at the king’s gate would bow down and ·kneel before [pay homage to] Haman, as the king had ·ordered [commanded]. But Mordecai would not bow down or ·show him honor [pay him homage; because he was a hated Amalekite]."},{"num":3,"verse":"Then the ·royal officers [ministers; officials] at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why don’t you obey the king’s command?” "},{"num":4,"verse":"And they said this to him every day. When he did not listen to them, they told Haman. They wanted to see if Haman would ·accept [tolerate; let stand] Mordecai’s behavior because Mordecai had told them he was a Jew."},{"num":5,"verse":"When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down to him or ·honor [pay homage to] him, he became ·very angry [enraged]. "},{"num":6,"verse":"He ·thought of himself as too important [disdained; thought it beneath him] to ·try to kill [lay hands on] only Mordecai. He had been told who the people of Mordecai were, so he looked for a way to destroy all of Mordecai’s people, the Jews, in all of ·Xerxes’ [Ahasuerus’s] ·kingdom [empire]."},{"num":7,"verse":"It was in the first month [April] of the twelfth year [about 474 bc; approximately a year later] of King ·Xerxes’ [Ahasuerus’s] ·rule [reign]—the month of Nisan.

Their ·customs [laws] are different from those of all the other ·people [nations; peoples], and they do not ·obey [observe; keep] the king’s laws.
