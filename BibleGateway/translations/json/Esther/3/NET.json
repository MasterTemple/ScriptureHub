However, Mordecai did not bow, nor did he pay him homage."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then the servants of the king who were at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you violating the king’s commandment?” "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And after they had spoken to him day after day without his paying any attention to them, they informed Haman to see whether this attitude on Mordecai’s part would be permitted.
