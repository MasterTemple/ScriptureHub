[{"header":"Balak Summons Balaam to Curse Israel"},{"num":22,"verse":"The Israelites set out, and camped in the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho.

"},{"num":4,"verse":"And Moab said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.

"},{"num":6,"verse":"Come now, curse this people for me, since they are stronger than I; perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land; for I know that whomever you bless is blessed, and whomever you curse is cursed.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and gave him Balak’s message. "},{"num":8,"verse":"He said to them, “Stay here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, just as the Lord speaks to me”; so the officials of Moab stayed with Balaam.

I wish I had a sword in my hand! I would kill you right now!” "},{"num":30,"verse":"But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I been in the habit of treating you this way?” And he said, “No.”"},{"num":31,"verse":"Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road, with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed down, falling on his face.
