They stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest and before the leaders and the congregation and said, “Our father died in the wilderness. He wasn’t part of Korah’s rebel anti-God gang. He died for his own sins. And he left no sons. But why should our father’s name die out from his clan just because he had no sons? So give us an inheritance among our father’s relatives.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Moses brought their case to God."},{"num":6,"verse":"God ruled: “Zelophehad’s daughters are right. Give them land as an inheritance among their father’s relatives. Give them their father’s inheritance."},{"num":8,"verse":"“Then tell the People of Israel, If a man dies and leaves no son, give his inheritance to his daughter. If he has no daughter, give it to his brothers. If he has no brothers, give it to his father’s brothers.

Stand him before Eleazar the priest in front of the entire congregation and commission him with everyone watching.

He is to consult with Eleazar the priest who, using the oracle-Urim, will prayerfully advise him in the presence of God.
