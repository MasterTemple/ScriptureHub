The people stayed in Kadesh."},{"num":2,"verse":"There was no water there for the community, so they ganged up on Moses and Aaron. They attacked Moses: “We wish we’d died when the rest of our brothers died before God. Why did you haul this congregation of God out here into this wilderness to die, people and cattle alike? And why did you take us out of Egypt in the first place, dragging us into this miserable country? No grain, no figs, no grapevines, no pomegranates—and now not even any water!”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Moses and Aaron walked from the assembled congregation to the Tent of Meeting and threw themselves facedown on the ground.

Our ancestors went down to Egypt and lived there a long time. The Egyptians viciously abused both us and our ancestors. But when we cried out for help to God, he heard our cry. He sent an angel and got us out of Egypt. And now here we are at Kadesh, a town at the border of your land."},{"num":17,"verse":"“Will you give us permission to cut across your land?
