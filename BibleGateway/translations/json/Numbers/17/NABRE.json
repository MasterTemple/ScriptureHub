Have them hammered into plates to cover the altar, because in being presented before the Lord they have become holy. In this way they shall serve as a sign to the Israelites. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So taking the bronze censers which had been presented by those who were burned, Eleazar the priest had them hammered into a covering for the altar, "},{"num":5,"verse":"just as the Lord had directed him through Moses. This was to be a reminder to the Israelites that no unauthorized person, no one who was not a descendant of Aaron, should draw near to offer incense before the Lord, lest he meet the fate of Korah and his faction."},{"num":6,"verse":"The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the Lord.” "},{"num":7,"verse":"But while the community was assembling against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the tent of meeting, and the cloud now covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared.
