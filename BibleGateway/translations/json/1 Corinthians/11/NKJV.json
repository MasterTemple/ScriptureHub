"},{"num":4,"verse":"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.

"},{"num":20,"verse":"Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper.
