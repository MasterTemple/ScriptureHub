"},{"num":3,"verse":"But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved, let her be covered. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For man is not from woman, but woman from man; "},{"num":9,"verse":"for man wasn’t created for the woman, but woman for the man.

"},{"num":20,"verse":"When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat. "},{"num":21,"verse":"For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken. "},{"num":22,"verse":"What, don’t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God’s assembly and put them to shame who don’t have enough? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you?
