[{"num":11,"verse":"So imitate me, watch my ways, follow my example, just as I, too, always seek to imitate the Anointed One."},{"num":2,"verse":"I must say how pleased I am to hear that you remember me in everything and continue to hold on to the traditions I have passed on to you. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But it is important that you understand this about headship: the Anointed One is the head of every man, the husband is the head of his wife, and God is the head of the Anointed. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Knowing this, any man wearing a covering over his head while praying or prophesying in your gathering disgraces his head, Jesus. "},{"num":5,"verse":"On the other hand, any woman—I mean, of course, a married woman—not wearing a veil over her head while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, her husband. It wouldn’t be much different than if she walked into worship with her head shaved. For if a woman isn’t going to be veiled properly, she ought to go ahead and cut off her hair; but if it brings shame to the woman and her husband to have all her hair cut off or her head shaved clean, then by all means let her wear a veil."},{"num":7,"verse":"Here’s the distinction: man is created in God’s image and for His glory, so he should not cover his head. But a wife is the glory of her husband. She ought to be covered. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Man, you remember, was not fashioned from the body of a woman. But woman, though she was sculpted by the hands of God, was fashioned from the bones and flesh of man. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Furthermore, don’t forget that man was not created for woman; woman was created for man to be his helper in everything. "},{"num":10,"verse":"This means that a wife should wear a veil on her head as a sign she is under authority, especially when gathering in the company of heavenly messengers. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Regardless of how it all began, husbands and wives should recognize they are not independent; "},{"num":12,"verse":"for just as woman was pulled from the side of man, man is pulled from the womb of woman. In a similar way, all things and all people share the same ultimate source, God."},{"num":13,"verse":"Judge for yourselves: when you gather to worship, is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God without covering her head? "},{"num":14,"verse":"Consider the ways of nature: doesn’t nature itself teach you that a man who wears his hair long invites shame and dishonor to cover him? "},{"num":15,"verse":"But doesn’t nature also teach that when a woman has long hair, it is her glory? It radiates her beauty and acts as a natural veil. "},{"num":16,"verse":"If you feel like debating more on this, just know that we, along with all other churches of God, have adopted the same custom."},{"num":17,"verse":"On this next matter, I wish I could applaud you; but I can’t because your gatherings have become counterproductive, making things worse for the community rather than better. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Let me start with this: I hear that your gatherings are polarizing the community; and to be honest, this doesn’t surprise me. "},{"num":19,"verse":"I’ve accepted the fact that factions are sometimes useful and even necessary so that those who are authentic and those who are counterfeit may be recognized. "},{"num":20,"verse":"This distinction is obvious when you come together because it is not the Lord’s Supper you are eating at all. "},{"num":21,"verse":"When it’s time to eat, some hastily dig right in; but look—some have more than others: over there someone is hungry, and over here someone is drunk! "},{"num":22,"verse":"What is going on? If a self-centered meal is what you want, can’t you eat and drink at home? Do you have so little respect for God’s people and this community that you shame the poor at the Lord’s table? I don’t even know what to say to you! Are you looking for my approval? You won’t find it."},{"num":23,"verse":"I passed on to you the tradition the Lord gave to me: On the same night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, He took the bread in His hands; "},{"num":24,"verse":"and after giving thanks to God, He broke it and said, “This is My body, broken for you. Keep doing this so that you and all who come after will have a vivid reminder of Me.” "},{"num":25,"verse":"After they had finished dinner, He took the cup and in the same way said, “This cup is the new covenant, executed in My blood. Keep doing this; and whenever you drink it, you and all who come after will have a vivid reminder of Me.” "},{"num":26,"verse":"Every time you taste this bread and every time you place the cup to your mouths and drink, you are declaring the Lord’s death, which is the ultimate expression of His faithfulness and love, until He comes again."},{"num":27,"verse":"So if someone takes of this bread and drinks from the Lord’s cup improperly—as you are doing—he is guilty of violating the body and blood of our Lord. "},{"num":28,"verse":"Examine yourselves first. Then you can properly approach the table to eat the bread and drink from the cup; "},{"num":29,"verse":"because otherwise, if you eat and drink without properly discerning the significance of the Lord’s body, then you eat and drink a mouthful of judgment upon yourself. "},{"num":30,"verse":"Because of this violation, many in your community are now sick and weak; some have even died. "},{"num":31,"verse":"But if we took care to judge ourselves, then we wouldn’t have to worry about being judged by another. "},{"num":32,"verse":"In fact, the Lord’s hand of judgment is correcting us so that we don’t suffer the same fate as the rest of the rebellious world: condemnation."},{"num":33,"verse":"From now on, brothers and sisters, this is what I want you to do: when you come together to eat at the Lord’s table, wait for each other. "},{"num":34,"verse":"If someone is hungry and can’t wait, he should go home and eat. In that way, your gatherings won’t result in God’s judgment. The rest of the instructions I have for you will have to wait until I come."}]
