But if it is shameful for a woman to cut off her hair or shave her head, she should wear a head covering."},{"num":7,"verse":"For a man ought not to wear a head covering, because he is the image and glory of God, but woman is man’s glory. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For man is not from woman, but woman from man, "},{"num":9,"verse":"and man was not created for the woman, but woman for the man.
