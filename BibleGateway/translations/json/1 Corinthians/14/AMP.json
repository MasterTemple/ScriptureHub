[{"header":"Prophecy a Superior Gift"},{"num":14,"verse":"Pursue [this] love [with eagerness, make it your goal], yet earnestly desire and cultivate the spiritual gifts [to be used by believers for the benefit of the church], but especially that you may prophesy [to foretell the future, to speak a new message from God to the people]. "},{"num":2,"verse":"For one who speaks in an unknown tongue does not speak to people but to God; for no one understands him or catches his meaning, but by the Spirit he speaks mysteries [secret truths, hidden things]. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But [on the other hand] the one who prophesies speaks to people for edification [to promote their spiritual growth] and [speaks words of] encouragement [to uphold and advise them concerning the matters of God] and [speaks words of] consolation [to compassionately comfort them]. "},{"num":4,"verse":"One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who prophesies edifies the church [promotes growth in spiritual wisdom, devotion, holiness, and joy]. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Now I wish that all of you spoke in unknown tongues, but even more [I wish] that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater [and more useful] than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he translates or explains [what he says], so that the church may be edified [instructed, improved, strengthened]."},{"num":6,"verse":"Now, believers, if I come to you speaking in unknown tongues, how will I benefit you unless I also speak to you [clearly] either by revelation [revealing God’s mystery], or by knowledge [teaching about God], or by prophecy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people], or by instruction [teaching precepts that develop spiritual maturity]? "},{"num":7,"verse":"Yet even lifeless things, whether flute or harp, when producing a sound, if they do not produce distinct [musical] tones, how will anyone [listening] know what is piped or played? "},{"num":8,"verse":"And if the [war] bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle? "},{"num":9,"verse":"So it is with you, if you speak words [in an unknown tongue] that are not intelligible and clear, how will anyone understand what you are saying? You will be talking into the air [wasting your breath]! "},{"num":10,"verse":"There are, I suppose, a great many kinds of languages in the world [unknown to us], and none is lacking in meaning. "},{"num":11,"verse":"But if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will [appear to] be a foreigner to the one who is speaking [since he knows exactly what he is saying], and the one who is speaking will [appear to] be a foreigner to me. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So it is with you, since you are so very eager to have spiritual gifts and manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in ways that will build up the church [spiritually]."},{"num":13,"verse":"Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may [be gifted to] translate or explain [what he says]. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive [because it does not understand what my spirit is praying]. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Then what am I to do? I will pray with the spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me] and I will pray with the mind [using words I understand]; I will sing with the spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me] and I will sing with the mind [using words I understand].

"},{"num":21,"verse":"It is written in the Law, “By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, and not even then will they listen to Me,” says the Lord. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Therefore, [unknown] tongues are [meant] for a [supernatural] sign, not to believers but to unbelievers [who might be receptive]; while prophecy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people] is not for unbelievers but for believers. "},{"num":23,"verse":"So then, if the whole church gathers together and all of you speak in [unknown] tongues, and outsiders or those who are not gifted [in spiritual matters] or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? "},{"num":24,"verse":"But if all prophesy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people], and an unbeliever or outsider comes in, he is convicted [of his sins] by all, and he is called to account by all [because he can understand what is being said]; "},{"num":25,"verse":"the secrets of his heart are laid bare. And so, falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is really among you."},{"num":26,"verse":"What then is the right course, believers? When you meet together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation (disclosure of special knowledge), a tongue, or an interpretation. Let everything be constructive and edifying and done for the good of all the church.

"},{"num":28,"verse":"But if there is no one to interpret, the one [who wishes to speak in a tongue] must keep silent in church; let him speak to himself and to God. "},{"num":29,"verse":"Let two or three prophets speak [as inspired by the Holy Spirit], while the rest pay attention and weigh carefully what is said. "},{"num":30,"verse":"But if an inspired revelation is made to another who is seated, then the first one must be silent. "},{"num":31,"verse":"For [in this way] you can all prophesy one by one, so that everyone may be instructed and everyone may be encouraged; "},{"num":32,"verse":"for the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets [the prophecy is under the speaker’s control, and he can stop speaking]; "},{"num":33,"verse":"for God [who is the source of their prophesying] is not a God of confusion and disorder but of peace and order."},{"num":34,"verse":"the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not authorized to speak, but are to take a subordinate place, as the Law says. "},{"num":35,"verse":"If there is anything they want to learn [that is, if they have questions about anything being said or taught], they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to talk in church.
