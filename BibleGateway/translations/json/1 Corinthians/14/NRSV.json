"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Now I would like all of you to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. One who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you in some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"It is the same way with lifeless instruments that produce sound, such as the flute or the harp. If they do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is being played? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So with yourselves; if in a tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If then I do not know the meaning of a sound, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"What should I do then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray with the mind also; I will sing praise with the spirit, but I will sing praise with the mind also. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Otherwise, if you say a blessing with the spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say the “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since the outsider does not know what you are saying? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For you may give thanks well enough, but the other person is not built up. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you; "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking; rather, be infants in evil, but in thinking be adults.
