[{"header":"Lessons from Israel’s Idolatry"},{"num":10,"verse":"I don’t want you to forget, dear brothers and sisters, about our ancestors in the wilderness long ago. All of them were guided by a cloud that moved ahead of them, and all of them walked through the sea on dry ground."},{"num":2,"verse":"In the cloud and in the sea, all of them were baptized as followers of Moses."},{"num":3,"verse":"All of them ate the same spiritual food,"},{"num":4,"verse":"and all of them drank the same spiritual water. For they drank from the spiritual rock that traveled with them, and that rock was Christ."},{"num":5,"verse":"Yet God was not pleased with most of them, and their bodies were scattered in the wilderness."},{"num":6,"verse":"These things happened as a warning to us, so that we would not crave evil things as they did,"},{"num":7,"verse":"or worship idols as some of them did. As the Scriptures say, “The people celebrated with feasting and drinking, and they indulged in pagan revelry.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"And we must not engage in sexual immorality as some of them did, causing 23,000 of them to die in one day."},{"num":9,"verse":"Nor should we put Christ to the test, as some of them did and then died from snakebites."},{"num":10,"verse":"And don’t grumble as some of them did, and then were destroyed by the angel of death."},{"num":11,"verse":"These things happened to them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us who live at the end of the age."},{"num":12,"verse":"If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall."},{"num":13,"verse":"The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience.

Weren’t they united by eating the sacrifices at the altar?"},{"num":19,"verse":"What am I trying to say? Am I saying that food offered to idols has some significance, or that idols are real gods?"},{"num":20,"verse":"No, not at all. I am saying that these sacrifices are offered to demons, not to God. And I don’t want you to participate with demons."},{"num":21,"verse":"You cannot drink from the cup of the Lord and from the cup of demons, too. You cannot eat at the Lord’s Table and at the table of demons, too."},{"num":22,"verse":"What? Do we dare to rouse the Lord’s jealousy? Do you think we are stronger than he is?"},{"num":23,"verse":"You say, “I am allowed to do anything”—but not everything is good for you. You say, “I am allowed to do anything”—but not everything is beneficial."},{"num":24,"verse":"Don’t be concerned for your own good but for the good of others."},{"num":25,"verse":"So you may eat any meat that is sold in the marketplace without raising questions of conscience."},{"num":26,"verse":"For “the earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"If someone who isn’t a believer asks you home for dinner, accept the invitation if you want to. Eat whatever is offered to you without raising questions of conscience."},{"num":28,"verse":"(But suppose someone tells you, “This meat was offered to an idol.” Don’t eat it, out of consideration for the conscience of the one who told you."},{"num":29,"verse":"It might not be a matter of conscience for you, but it is for the other person.) For why should my freedom be limited by what someone else thinks?"},{"num":30,"verse":"If I can thank God for the food and enjoy it, why should I be condemned for eating it?"},{"num":31,"verse":"So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God."},{"num":32,"verse":"Don’t give offense to Jews or Gentiles or the church of God."},{"num":33,"verse":"I, too, try to please everyone in everything I do. I don’t just do what is best for me; I do what is best for others so that many may be saved."}]
