"},{"num":3,"verse":"They all ate the same spiritual food "},{"num":4,"verse":"and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them—and that rock was Christ! "},{"num":5,"verse":"Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them. He had them die in the wilderness."},{"num":6,"verse":"Now these things took place as examples to warn us not to desire evil things the way they did. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Do not become idolaters like some of them—as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to celebrate wildly.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"And let us not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.
