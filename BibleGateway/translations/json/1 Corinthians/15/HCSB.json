"},{"num":3,"verse":"For I passed on to you as most important what I also received:"},{"num":9,"verse":"For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But by God’s grace I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not ineffective. However, I worked more than any of them, yet not I, but God’s grace that was with me.
