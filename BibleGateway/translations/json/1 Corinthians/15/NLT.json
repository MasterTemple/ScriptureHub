Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He was seen by Peter and then by the Twelve."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For I am the least of all the apostles. In fact, I’m not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God’s church."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But whatever I am now, it is all because God poured out his special favor on me—and not without results.

But that can’t be true if there is no resurrection of the dead."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is useless and you are still guilty of your sins."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"In that case, all who have died believing in Christ are lost!"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And if our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead. He is the first of a great harvest of all who have died."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So you see, just as death came into the world through a man, now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Just as everyone dies because we all belong to Adam, everyone who belongs to Christ will be given new life."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But there is an order to this resurrection: Christ was raised as the first of the harvest; then all who belong to Christ will be raised when he comes back."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"After that the end will come, when he will turn the Kingdom over to God the Father, having destroyed every ruler and authority and power."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For Christ must reign until he humbles all his enemies beneath his feet."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And the last enemy to be destroyed is death."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For the Scriptures say, “God has put all things under his authority.” (Of course, when it says “all things are under his authority,” that does not include God himself, who gave Christ his authority.)"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then, when all things are under his authority, the Son will put himself under God’s authority, so that God, who gave his Son authority over all things, will be utterly supreme over everything everywhere."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If the dead will not be raised, what point is there in people being baptized for those who are dead?

This is as certain as my pride in what Christ Jesus our Lord has done in you."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And what value was there in fighting wild beasts—those people of Ephesus—if there will be no resurrection from the dead?

The glory of the heavenly bodies is different from the glory of the earthly bodies."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The sun has one kind of glory, while the moon and stars each have another kind. And even the stars differ from each other in their glory."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"It is the same way with the resurrection of the dead. Our earthly bodies are planted in the ground when we die, but they will be raised to live forever."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Our bodies are buried in brokenness, but they will be raised in glory. They are buried in weakness, but they will be raised in strength."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"They are buried as natural human bodies, but they will be raised as spiritual bodies. For just as there are natural bodies, there are also spiritual bodies."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The Scriptures tell us, “The first man, Adam, became a living person.” But the last Adam—that is, Christ—is a life-giving Spirit."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"What comes first is the natural body, then the spiritual body comes later."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Adam, the first man, was made from the dust of the earth, while Christ, the second man, came from heaven."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Earthly people are like the earthly man, and heavenly people are like the heavenly man."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Just as we are now like the earthly man, we will someday be like the heavenly man."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"What I am saying, dear brothers and sisters, is that our physical bodies cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.
