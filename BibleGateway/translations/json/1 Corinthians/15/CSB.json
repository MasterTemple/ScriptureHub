[{"header":"Resurrection Essential to the Gospel"},{"num":15,"verse":"Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel I preached to you, which you received, on which you have taken your stand "},{"num":2,"verse":"and by which you are being saved, if you hold to the message I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, "},{"num":4,"verse":"that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, "},{"num":5,"verse":"and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Last of all, as to one born at the wrong time, he also appeared to me."},{"num":9,"verse":"For I am the least of the apostles, not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised; "},{"num":14,"verse":"and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is in vain, and so is your faith. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Moreover, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified wrongly about God that he raised up Christ—whom he did not raise up, if in fact the dead are not raised. "},{"num":16,"verse":"For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. "},{"num":17,"verse":"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Those, then, who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished.

"},{"num":22,"verse":"For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive."},{"num":23,"verse":"But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; afterward, at his coming, those who belong to Christ. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he abolishes all rule and all authority and power. "},{"num":25,"verse":"For he must reign until he puts all his enemies under his feet. "},{"num":26,"verse":"The last enemy to be abolished is death. "},{"num":27,"verse":"For God has put everything under his feet. Now when it says “everything” is put under him, it is obvious that he who puts everything under him is the exception.

"},{"num":37,"verse":"And as for what you sow—you are not sowing the body that will be, but only a seed, perhaps of wheat or another grain. "},{"num":38,"verse":"But God gives it a body as he wants, and to each of the seeds its own body. "},{"num":39,"verse":"Not all flesh is the same flesh; there is one flesh for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish. "},{"num":40,"verse":"There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is different from that of the earthly ones. "},{"num":41,"verse":"There is a splendor of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; in fact, one star differs from another star in splendor.

If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. "},{"num":45,"verse":"So it is written, The first man Adam became a living being; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
