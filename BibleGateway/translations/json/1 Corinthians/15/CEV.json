That part is:"},{"num":8,"verse":"Finally, he appeared to me, even though I am like someone who was born at the wrong time."},{"num":9,"verse":"I am the least important of all the apostles. In fact, I caused so much trouble for God’s church that I don’t even deserve to be called an apostle. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But God was kind! He made me what I am, and his wonderful kindness wasn’t wasted. I worked much harder than any of the other apostles, although it was really God’s kindness at work and not me.

"},{"num":15,"verse":"If the dead won’t be raised to life, we have told lies about God by saying that he raised Christ to life, when he really did not."},{"num":16,"verse":"So if the dead won’t be raised to life, Christ wasn’t raised to life.
