"},{"num":2,"verse":"Even if others do not accept me as an apostle, surely you do! Because of your life in union with the Lord you yourselves are proof of the fact that I am an apostle."},{"num":3,"verse":"When people criticize me, this is how I defend myself: "},{"num":4,"verse":"Don't I have the right to be given food and drink for my work? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Don't I have the right to follow the example of the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Peter, by taking a Christian wife with me on my trips? "},{"num":6,"verse":"Or are Barnabas and I the only ones who have to work for our living? "},{"num":7,"verse":"What soldiers ever have to pay their own expenses in the army? What farmers do not eat the grapes from their own vineyard? What shepherds do not use the milk from their own sheep?"},{"num":8,"verse":"I don't have to limit myself to these everyday examples, because the Law says the same thing. "},{"num":9,"verse":"We read in the Law of Moses, “Do not muzzle an ox when you are using it to thresh grain.” Now, is God concerned about oxen? "},{"num":10,"verse":"Didn't he really mean us when he said that? Of course that was written for us.

I would rather die first! Nobody is going to turn my rightful boast into empty words! "},{"num":16,"verse":"I have no right to boast just because I preach the gospel. After all, I am under orders to do so. And how terrible it would be for me if I did not preach the gospel!

It is the privilege of preaching the Good News without charging for it, without claiming my rights in my work for the gospel."},{"num":19,"verse":"I am a free man, nobody's slave; but I make myself everybody's slave in order to win as many people as possible.
