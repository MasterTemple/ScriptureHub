[{"header":"Paul’s Right to Be Paid for His Work as an Apostle"},{"num":9,"verse":"Don’t you agree that I’m a free man? Don’t you agree that I’m an apostle? Haven’t I seen Jesus our Lord? Aren’t you the result of my work for the Lord? "},{"num":2,"verse":"If I’m not an apostle to other people, at least I’m an apostle to you. You are the seal which proves that I am the Lord’s apostle.

"},{"num":5,"verse":"Don’t we have the right to take our wives along with us like the other apostles, the Lord’s brothers, and Cephas  do? "},{"num":6,"verse":"Or is it only Barnabas and I who don’t have any rights, except to find work to support ourselves?"},{"num":7,"verse":"Does a soldier ever serve in the army at his own expense? Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat the grapes? Does anyone take care of a flock and not drink milk from the sheep? "},{"num":8,"verse":"Am I merely stating some human rule? Don’t Moses’ Teachings say the same thing? "},{"num":9,"verse":"Moses’ Teachings say, “Never muzzle an ox when it is threshing  grain.” God’s concern isn’t for oxen. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Isn’t he speaking entirely for our benefit? This was written for our benefit so that the person who plows or threshes should expect to receive a share of the crop.

Don’t those who help at the altar get a share of what is on the altar?

I would rather die than have anyone turn my bragging into meaningless words. "},{"num":16,"verse":"If I spread the Good News, I have nothing to brag about because I have an obligation to do this. How horrible it will be for me if I don’t spread the Good News! "},{"num":17,"verse":"If I spread the Good News willingly, I’ll have a reward. But if I spread the Good News unwillingly, I’m ⌞only⌟ doing what I’ve been entrusted to do."},{"num":18,"verse":"So what is my reward? It is to spread the Good News free of charge.
