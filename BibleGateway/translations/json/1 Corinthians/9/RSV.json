[{"header":"The Rights of an Apostle"},{"num":9,"verse":"Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not you my workmanship in the Lord? "},{"num":2,"verse":"If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."},{"num":3,"verse":"This is my defense to those who would examine me. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Do we not have the right to our food and drink? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a wife, as the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? "},{"num":6,"verse":"Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living? "},{"num":7,"verse":"Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?"},{"num":8,"verse":"Do I say this on human authority? Does not the law say the same? "},{"num":9,"verse":"For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned? "},{"num":10,"verse":"Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of a share in the crop. "},{"num":11,"verse":"If we have sown spiritual good among you, is it too much if we reap your material benefits? "},{"num":12,"verse":"If others share this rightful claim upon you, do not we still more?"},{"num":13,"verse":"Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings? "},{"num":14,"verse":"In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel."},{"num":15,"verse":"But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing this to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have any one deprive me of my ground for boasting. "},{"num":16,"verse":"For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! "},{"num":17,"verse":"For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission. "},{"num":18,"verse":"What then is my reward? Just this: that in my preaching I may make the gospel free of charge, not making full use of my right in the gospel."},{"num":19,"verse":"For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all, that I might win the more. "},{"num":20,"verse":"To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews; to those under the law I became as one under the law—though not being myself under the law—that I might win those under the law.
