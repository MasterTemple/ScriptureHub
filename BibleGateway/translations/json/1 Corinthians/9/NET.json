"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Do we not have the right to the company of a believing wife, like the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Or do only Barnabas and I lack the right not to work? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Who ever serves in the army at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not consume its milk? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Am I saying these things only on the basis of common sense, or does the law not say this as well? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For it is written in the law of Moses, “.” God is not concerned here about oxen, is he? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Or is he not surely speaking for our benefit? It was written for us, because the one plowing and threshing ought to work in hope of enjoying the harvest. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If we sowed spiritual blessings among you, is it too much to reap material things from you? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If others receive this right from you, are we not more deserving?But we have not made use of this right. Instead we endure everything so that we may not be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple eat food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar receive a part of the offerings?

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing these things so that something will be done for me. In fact, it would be better for me to die than—no one will deprive me of my reason for boasting! "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason for boasting, because I am compelled to do this. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward. But if I do it unwillingly, I am entrusted with a responsibility. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel I may offer the gospel free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights in the gospel."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For since I am free from all I can make myself a slave to all, in order to gain even more people. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"To the Jews I became like a Jew to gain the Jews.
