But we have never used this right. We would rather put up with anything than be an obstacle to the Good News about Christ."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Don’t you realize that those who work in the temple get their meals from the offerings brought to the temple? And those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrificial offerings."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"In the same way, the Lord ordered that those who preach the Good News should be supported by those who benefit from it."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Yet I have never used any of these rights.

In fact, I would rather die than lose my right to boast about preaching without charge."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Yet preaching the Good News is not something I can boast about. I am compelled by God to do it. How terrible for me if I didn’t preach the Good News!"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If I were doing this on my own initiative, I would deserve payment. But I have no choice, for God has given me this sacred trust."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"What then is my pay? It is the opportunity to preach the Good News without charging anyone. That’s why I never demand my rights when I preach the Good News."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Even though I am a free man with no master, I have become a slave to all people to bring many to Christ."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When I was with the Jews, I lived like a Jew to bring the Jews to Christ.
