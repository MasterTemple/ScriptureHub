And you still aren’t ready,"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"for you are still controlled by your sinful nature. You are jealous of one another and quarrel with each other. Doesn’t that prove you are controlled by your sinful nature? Aren’t you living like people of the world?"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When one of you says, “I am a follower of Paul,” and another says, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you acting just like people of the world?"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"After all, who is Apollos? Who is Paul? We are only God’s servants through whom you believed the Good News.
