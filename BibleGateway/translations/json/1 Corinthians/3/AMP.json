"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not yet able . Even now you are still not ready. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"You are still worldly [controlled by ordinary impulses, the sinful capacity]. For as long as there is jealousy and strife  discord among you, are you not unspiritual, and are you not walking like ordinary men [unchanged by faith]? "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For when one  says, “I am [a disciple] of Paul,” and another, “I am [a disciple] of Apollos,” are you not [proving yourselves unchanged, just]  people?"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Just servants through whom you believed [in Christ], even as the Lord appointed to each his task.

But each one must be careful how he builds on it, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"for no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is [already] laid, which is Jesus Christ. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"each one’s work will be clearly shown [for what it is]; for the day [of judgment] will disclose it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality  character  worth of each person’s work.
