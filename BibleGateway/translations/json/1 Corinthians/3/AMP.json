[{"header":"Foundations for Living"},{"num":3,"verse":"However, brothers and sisters, I could not talk to you as to spiritual people, but [only] as to worldly people [dominated by human nature], mere infants [in the new life] in Christ! "},{"num":2,"verse":"I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Even now you are still not ready. "},{"num":3,"verse":"You are still worldly [controlled by ordinary impulses, the sinful capacity]. For as long as there is jealousy and strife and discord among you, are you not unspiritual, and are you not walking like ordinary men [unchanged by faith]? "},{"num":4,"verse":"For when one of you says, “I am [a disciple] of Paul,” and another, “I am [a disciple] of Apollos,” are you not [proving yourselves unchanged, just] ordinary people?"},{"num":5,"verse":"What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Just servants through whom you believed [in Christ], even as the Lord appointed to each his task. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I planted, Apollos watered, but God [all the while] was causing the growth. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So neither is the one who plants nor the one who waters anything, but [only] God who causes the growth. "},{"num":8,"verse":"He who plants and he who waters are one [in importance and esteem, working toward the same purpose]; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. "},{"num":9,"verse":"For we are God’s fellow workers [His servants working together]; you are God’s cultivated field [His garden, His vineyard], God’s building."},{"num":10,"verse":"According to the [remarkable] grace of God which was given to me [to prepare me for my task], like a skillful master builder I laid a foundation, and now another is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds on it, "},{"num":11,"verse":"for no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is [already] laid, which is Jesus Christ. "},{"num":12,"verse":"But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, "},{"num":13,"verse":"each one’s work will be clearly shown [for what it is]; for the day [of judgment] will disclose it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality and character and worth of each person’s work. "},{"num":14,"verse":"If any person’s work which he has built [on this foundation, that is, any outcome of his effort] remains [and survives this test], he will receive a reward. "},{"num":15,"verse":"But if any person’s work is burned up [by the test], he will suffer the loss [of his reward]; yet he himself will be saved, but only as [one who has barely escaped] through fire."},{"num":16,"verse":"Do you not know and understand that you [the church] are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells [permanently] in you [collectively and individually]? "},{"num":17,"verse":"If anyone destroys the temple of God [corrupting it with false doctrine], God will destroy the destroyer; for the temple of God is holy (sacred), and that is what you are."},{"num":18,"verse":"Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool [discarding his worldly pretensions and acknowledging his lack of wisdom], so that he may become [truly] wise. "},{"num":19,"verse":"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness (absurdity, stupidity) before God; for it is written [in Scripture], “[He is] The one who catches the wise and clever in their craftiness;” "},{"num":20,"verse":"and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the [humanly] wise, that they are useless.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"So let no one boast in men [about their wisdom, or of having this or that one as a leader]. For all things are yours, "},{"num":22,"verse":"whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas (Peter) or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things are yours, "},{"num":23,"verse":"and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God."}]
