[{"header":"Judging Problems Among Christians"},{"num":6,"verse":"When you have ·something against [a legal dispute with; a grievance against] another Christian, how can you ·bring yourself [dare] to go before ·judges who are not right with God [or the pagan courts; the unrighteous] instead of before ·God’s people [the saints]? "},{"num":2,"verse":"·Surely [Don’t…?] you know that ·God’s people [the saints] will judge the world. So if you are to judge the world, are you not able to judge ·small [trivial; the smallest of] cases as well? "},{"num":3,"verse":"·You [Don’t you…?] know that we will judge angels, so surely we can judge the ·ordinary things of [or matters pertaining to] this life. "},{"num":4,"verse":"If you have ·ordinary cases [cases/legal disputes of this life] that must be judged, ·are you going to appoint people as judges who mean nothing to the church? [will you appoint judges with no standing in/whose lifestyle is rejected by the church?; or go ahead and appoint the least members of the church to judge them! in the latter interpretation, Paul speaks sarcastically.] "},{"num":5,"verse":"I say this to shame you. ·Surely there is someone [Is there no one…?] among you wise enough to judge a ·complaint [dispute; conflict] between ·believers [a brother]. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But now one ·believer [brother] goes to court against another ·believer [brother]—and you do this in front of unbelievers!"},{"num":7,"verse":"The fact that you have lawsuits against each other shows that you are already defeated. Why not ·let yourselves be wronged [suffer the injustice]? Why not let yourselves be cheated? "},{"num":8,"verse":"But you yourselves ·do wrong [act unjustly] and cheat, and you do this to ·other believers [brothers]!"},{"num":11,"verse":"In the past, some of you were like that, but you were washed clean. You were ·made holy [sanctified], and you were ·made right with God [justified; declared righteous] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ·in [or by; through] the Spirit of our God."},{"header":"Use Your Bodies for God’s Glory"},{"num":12,"verse":"“·I am allowed to do all things [All things are lawful/permissible for me; probably a slogan the Corinthians were using; see also 7:1; 8:1, 4; 10:23],” but not all things are ·good for me to do [profitable; beneficial]. “·I am allowed to do all things [All things are lawful/permissible for me],” but I will not let anything make me its slave. "},{"num":13,"verse":"“Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food, but God will ·destroy [do away with] them both [probably another Corinthian slogan (v. 12), meaning only the spirit matters, not what we do with our physical bodies; Paul disagrees].” The body is not for sexual sin but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. "},{"num":14,"verse":"By his power God has raised the Lord from the dead and will also raise us from the dead. "},{"num":15,"verse":"·Surely [Don’t…?] you know that your bodies are ·parts [members] of Christ himself. Should I take the ·parts [members] of Christ and join them to a prostitute? ·Never [Absolutely not; May it never be]! "},{"num":16,"verse":"Don’t you know that anyone who joins with a prostitute [in a sexual relationship] becomes one body with the prostitute? For it is written in the Scriptures, “The two will become one ·body [flesh; Gen. 2:24].” "},{"num":17,"verse":"But the one who joins with the Lord [in spiritual union] is one spirit with the Lord."},{"num":18,"verse":"So ·run away from [flee; stay away from] sexual sin. Every other sin people do is outside their bodies, but those who sin sexually sin against their own bodies. "},{"num":19,"verse":"·You should [Don’t you…?] know that your body is a temple for the Holy Spirit who is in you and was given to you by God. So you do not belong to yourselves, "},{"num":20,"verse":"because you were ·bought by God [bought] for a price. So honor God with your bodies."}]
