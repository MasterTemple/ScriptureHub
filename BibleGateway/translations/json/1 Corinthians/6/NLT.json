And since you are going to judge the world, can’t you decide even these little things among yourselves?"},{"num":3,"verse":"Don’t you realize that we will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life."},{"num":4,"verse":"If you have legal disputes about such matters, why go to outside judges who are not respected by the church?"},{"num":5,"verse":"I am saying this to shame you. Isn’t there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these issues?"},{"num":6,"verse":"But instead, one believer sues another—right in front of unbelievers!"},{"num":7,"verse":"Even to have such lawsuits with one another is a defeat for you. Why not just accept the injustice and leave it at that? Why not let yourselves be cheated?"},{"num":8,"verse":"Instead, you yourselves are the ones who do wrong and cheat even your fellow believers."},{"num":9,"verse":"Don’t you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God?

Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality,"},{"num":10,"verse":"or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people—none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God."},{"num":11,"verse":"Some of you were once like that.
