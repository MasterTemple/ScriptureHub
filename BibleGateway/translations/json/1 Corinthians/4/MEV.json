"},{"num":2,"verse":"Moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by man’s judgment. I do not even judge myself. "},{"num":4,"verse":"For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this. But He who judges me is the Lord. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the purposes of the hearts. Then everyone will have commendation from God."},{"num":6,"verse":"Brothers, I have figuratively applied these things to myself and to Apollos for your sakes, so that you may learn from us not to think of men above that which is written, and that not one of you would be arrogant for one against another. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you received it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"},{"num":8,"verse":"Now you are full, now you are rich; you have begun reigning as kings without us, and I wish to God you reigned, so that we also might reign with you.
