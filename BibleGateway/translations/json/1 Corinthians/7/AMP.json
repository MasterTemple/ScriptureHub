"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Do not deprive each other [of marital rights], except perhaps by mutual consent for a time, so that you may devote yourselves [unhindered] to prayer, but come together again so that Satan will not tempt you [to sin] because of your lack of self-control. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But I am saying this as a concession, not as a command. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"I wish that all the people were as I am; but each person has his own gift from God, one of this kind and one of that."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, [that as a practical matter] it is good if they remain [single and entirely devoted to the Lord] as I am.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And if any [believing] woman has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not leave him. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified [that is, he receives the blessings granted] through his [Christian] wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be [ceremonially] unclean, but as it is they are holy. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him leave. In such cases the [remaining] brother or sister is not [spiritually or morally] bound. But God has called us to peace.

Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife [by leading her to Christ]?"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Only, let each one live the life which the Lord has assigned him, and to which God has called him [for each person is unique and is accountable for his choices and conduct, let him walk in this way]. This is the rule I make in all the churches. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Was anyone at the time of his calling [from God already] circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called while uncircumcised? He is not to be circumcised. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but  keeping the commandments of God.

Yet those [who marry] will have troubles (special challenges) in this life, and I am trying to spare you that. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But I say this, believers: the time has been shortened, so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they did not; "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess [anything]; "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"and those who use the world [taking advantage of its opportunities], as though they did not make full use of it.

The unmarried woman or the virgin is concerned about the matters of the Lord, how to be holy  set apart both in body and in spirit; but a married woman is concerned about worldly things, how she may please her husband.
