However, each has his own gift from God, one in this way, and another in that."},{"num":8,"verse":"But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I."},{"num":9,"verse":"But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."},{"num":10,"verse":"But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife is not to leave her husband"},{"num":11,"verse":"(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband is not to divorce his wife."},{"num":12,"verse":"But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her."},{"num":13,"verse":"And if any woman has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce her husband."},{"num":14,"verse":"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy."},{"num":15,"verse":"Yet if the unbelieving one is leaving, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace."},{"num":16,"verse":"For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?
