Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. "},{"num":15,"verse":"But if the unbeliever separates, let him be separated. The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases, but God has called you to shalom. "},{"num":16,"verse":"For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?
