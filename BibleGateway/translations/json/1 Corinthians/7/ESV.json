Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?
