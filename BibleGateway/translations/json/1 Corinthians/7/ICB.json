So each man should have his own wife. And each woman should have her own husband. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The husband should give his wife all that she should have as his wife. And the wife should give her husband all that he should have as her husband. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The wife does not have power over her own body. Her husband has the power over her body. And the husband does not have power over his own body. His wife has the power over his body. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Do not refuse to give your bodies to each other. But you might both agree to stay away from intimate relations for a time. You might do this so that you can give your time to prayer. Then come together again. This is so that Satan cannot tempt you in your weakness. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I say this to give you permission. It is not a command. "},{"num":7,"verse":"I wish everyone were like me. But each person has his own gift from God. One has one gift, another has another gift."},{"num":8,"verse":"Now for those who are not married and for the widows I say this: It is good for them to stay single as I am.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"The husband who is not a believer is made holy through his believing wife. And the wife who is not a believer is made holy through her believing husband. If this were not true, then your children would not be clean. But now your children are holy."},{"num":15,"verse":"But if the person who is not a believer decides to leave, let him leave. When this happens, the brother or sister in Christ is free. God called us to a life of peace.

This is a rule I make in all the churches. "},{"num":18,"verse":"If a man was already circumcised when he was called, he should not change his circumcision. If a man was without circumcision when he was called, he should not be circumcised. "},{"num":19,"verse":"It is not important if a man is circumcised or not circumcised.

So starting now, those who have wives should use their time to serve the Lord as if they had no wives. "},{"num":30,"verse":"Those who are sad should live as if they are not sad. Those who are happy should live as if they are not happy. Those who buy things should live as if they own nothing.

You should live like this, because this world, the way it is now, will soon be gone."},{"num":32,"verse":"I want you to be free from worry. A man who is not married is busy with the Lord’s work.

"},{"num":34,"verse":"He must think about two things—pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord. A woman who is not married or a girl who has never married is busy with the Lord’s work. She wants to give herself fully—body and soul—to the Lord. But a married woman is busy with things of the world. She is trying to please her husband.
