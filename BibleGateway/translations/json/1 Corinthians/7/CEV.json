[{"header":"Questions about Marriage"},{"num":7,"verse":"Now I will answer the questions that you asked in your letter.

"},{"num":3,"verse":"Husbands and wives should be fair with each other about having sex. "},{"num":4,"verse":"A wife belongs to her husband instead of to herself, and a husband belongs to his wife instead of to himself. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So don’t refuse sex to each other, unless you agree not to have sex for a little while, in order to spend time in prayer. Then Satan won’t be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.

A wife who leaves her husband "},{"num":11,"verse":"should either stay single or go back to her husband.
