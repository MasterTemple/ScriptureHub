Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does."},{"num":5,"verse":"Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."},{"num":6,"verse":"Now as a concession, not a command, I say this."},{"num":7,"verse":"I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another."},{"num":8,"verse":"To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am."},{"num":9,"verse":"But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry.
