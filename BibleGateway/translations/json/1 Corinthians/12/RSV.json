"},{"num":2,"verse":"You know that when you were heathen, you were led astray to dumb idols, however you may have been moved. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus be cursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit."},{"num":4,"verse":"Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; "},{"num":5,"verse":"and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; "},{"num":6,"verse":"and there are varieties of working, but it is the same God who inspires them all in every one.
