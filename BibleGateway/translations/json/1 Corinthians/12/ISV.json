"},{"num":2,"verse":"You know that when you were unbelievers, you were enticed and led astray to worship idols that couldn’t even speak. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For this reason I want you to be aware that no one who is speaking by God’s Spirit can say, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit."},{"num":4,"verse":"Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit, "},{"num":5,"verse":"and there are varieties of ministries, but the same Lord. "},{"num":6,"verse":"There are varieties of results, but it is the same God who produces all the results in everyone."},{"num":7,"verse":"To each person has been given the ability to manifest the Spirit for the common good. "},{"num":8,"verse":"To one has been given a message of wisdom by the Spirit; to another the ability to speak with knowledge according to the same Spirit; "},{"num":9,"verse":"to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit; "},{"num":10,"verse":"to another miraculous results; to another prophecy; to another the ability to distinguish between spirits; to another various kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"For by one Spirit all of us—Jews and Greeks, slaves and free—were baptized into one body and were all privileged to drink from one Spirit."},{"num":14,"verse":"For the body does not consist of only one part, but of many. "},{"num":15,"verse":"If the foot says, “Since I’m not a hand, I’m not part of the body,” that does not make it any less a part of the body, does it?
