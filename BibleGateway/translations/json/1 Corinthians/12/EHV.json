[{"header":"All the Gifts of the Spirit Are Beneficial"},{"num":12,"verse":"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. "},{"num":2,"verse":"You know that when you were pagans, you were deceived and somehow led away to mute idols. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Therefore I am informing you that no one speaking by God’s Spirit says, “A curse be upon Jesus,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit."},{"num":4,"verse":"There are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. "},{"num":5,"verse":"There are different kinds of ministries, and yet the same Lord. "},{"num":6,"verse":"There are various kinds of activity, but the same God, who produces all of them in everyone."},{"num":7,"verse":"Each person is given a manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. "},{"num":8,"verse":"To one person a message of wisdom is given by the Spirit; to another, a message of knowledge, as the same Spirit provides it; "},{"num":9,"verse":"by the same Spirit, faith is given to someone else; and to another, the same Spirit gives healing gifts. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Another is given powers to do miracles; another, the gift of prophecy; another, the evaluating of spirits; someone else, different kinds of tongues; and another, the interpretation of tongues. "},{"num":11,"verse":"One and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing them to each one individually as he desires."},{"header":"The Diversity of the Gifts Enhances the Unity of the Body of Christ"},{"num":12,"verse":"For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so also is Christ. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For by one Spirit we all were baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free people, and we were all caused to drink one Spirit. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Furthermore, the body is not one member, but many. "},{"num":15,"verse":"If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I am not part of the body,” it does not on that account cease to be part of the body. "},{"num":16,"verse":"If the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,” it does not on that account cease to be part of the body.

"},{"num":23,"verse":"As for the parts of the body we consider less honorable, these we provide with more honor.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"He did it so that there might not be any division in the body, but that the members might all have the same concern for one another. "},{"num":26,"verse":"So if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it, or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."},{"num":27,"verse":"You are the body of Christ, and individually you are members of it.
