"},{"num":2,"verse":"You know the way you lived before you were believers. You let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols—things that could not speak. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So I want you to understand that no one who is speaking with the help of God’s Spirit says, “Jesus be cursed.” And no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” without the help of the Holy Spirit."},{"num":4,"verse":"There are different kinds of gifts, but they are all from the same Spirit. "},{"num":5,"verse":"There are different ways to serve but the same Lord to serve. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And there are different ways that God works through people but the same God. God works in all of us in everything we do. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Something from the Spirit can be seen in each person, for the common good. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak with wisdom, and the same Spirit gives another the ability to speak with knowledge. "},{"num":9,"verse":"The same Spirit gives faith to one person. And, to another, that one Spirit gives gifts of healing. "},{"num":10,"verse":"The Spirit gives to another person the power to do miracles, to another the ability to prophesy. And he gives to another the ability to know the difference between good and evil spirits.
