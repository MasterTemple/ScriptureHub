[{"header":"Concerning Spiritual Gifts: God Distributes a Variety of Gifts For Our Mutual Benefit"},{"num":12,"verse":"Now concerning the spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be unaware. "},{"num":2,"verse":"You know that when you were Gentiles, you were being led-away to the speechless idols, however you were being led. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Therefore I make-known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God is saying “Jesus is accursed”. And no one is able to say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Now there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And there are differences of ministries, and the same Lord. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And there are differences of things-worked, but the same God working all things in all persons. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And the manifestation of  the Spirit is given to each one for our benefit. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For to one a word of  wisdom is given through the Spirit; and to another, a word of knowledge according-to the same Spirit; "},{"num":9,"verse":"to a different one, faith by the same Spirit; and to another, gifts of  healings by the one Spirit; "},{"num":10,"verse":"and to another, things-worked by miracles; and to another, prophecy; and to another, discernments of spirits; to a different one, kinds of tongues; and to another, interpretation of tongues. "},{"num":11,"verse":"But the one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually, just as He wills."},{"header":"For The Body of Christ Is Like The Human Body"},{"num":12,"verse":"For just as the [human] body is one [body]; and it has many body-parts; and all the body-parts of the [human] body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ."},{"header":"It Is One Body With One Spirit"},{"num":13,"verse":"For indeed with one Spirit, we all were baptized into one body— whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free.
