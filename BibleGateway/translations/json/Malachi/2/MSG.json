He walked with me in peace and uprightness. He kept many out of the ditch, kept them on the road."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"“It’s the job of priests to teach the truth. People are supposed to look to them for guidance. The priest is the messenger of -of-the-Angel-Armies. But you priests have abandoned the way of priests. Your teaching has messed up many lives. You have corrupted the covenant of priest Levi. -of-the-Angel-Armies says so. And so I am showing you up for who you are.
