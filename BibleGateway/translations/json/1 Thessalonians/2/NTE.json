We had already undergone awful things and been shamefully treated in Philippi, as you know; but we were open and exuberant in our God in declaring to you the gospel of God, despite a good deal of opposition."},{"num":3,"verse":"When we make our appeal, you see, we are not deceiving people. We don’t have any impure motives; we aren’t playing some kind of trick. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Rather, we speak as people whom God has validated to be entrusted with the gospel; not with a view to pleasing people, but in order to please God, who validates our hearts."},{"num":5,"verse":"For we never used flattering words, as you know. Nor were we saying things insincerely, as a cover-up for greed, as God is our witness. "},{"num":6,"verse":"We weren’t looking for recognition from anybody, either you or anyone else – "},{"num":7,"verse":"though we could have imposed on you, as the Messiah’s emissaries.

They displease God; they oppose all people; "},{"num":16,"verse":"they forbid us to speak to the Gentiles so that they may be saved.
