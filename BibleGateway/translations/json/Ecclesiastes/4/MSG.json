So I congratulated the dead who are already dead instead of the living who are still alive. But luckier than the dead or the living is the person who has never even been, who has never seen the bad business that takes place on this earth."},{"num":4,"verse":"Then I observed all the work and ambition motivated by envy. What a waste! Smoke. And spitting into the wind."},{"header":"Why Am I Working Like a Dog?"},{"num":7,"verse":"I turned my head and saw yet another wisp of smoke on its way to nothingness: a solitary person, completely alone—no children, no family, no friends—yet working obsessively late into the night, compulsively greedy for more and more, never bothering to ask, “Why am I working like a dog, never having any fun? And who cares?” More smoke. A bad business."},{"num":13,"verse":"A poor child with some wisdom is better off than an old but foolish king who doesn’t know which end is up.
