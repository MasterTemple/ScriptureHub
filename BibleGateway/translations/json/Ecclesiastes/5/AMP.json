[{"header":"Your Attitude Toward God"},{"num":5,"verse":"Guard your steps and focus on what you are doing as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the [careless or irreverent] sacrifice of fools; for they are too ignorant to know they are doing evil. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Do not be hasty with your mouth [speaking careless words or vows] or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter before God. For God is in heaven and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For the dream comes through much effort, and the voice of the fool through many words."},{"num":4,"verse":"When you make a vow or a pledge to God, do not put off paying it; for God takes no pleasure in fools [who thoughtlessly mock Him]. Pay what you vow. "},{"num":5,"verse":"It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Do not allow your speech to cause you to sin, and do not say before the messenger (priest) of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry because of your voice (words) and destroy the work of your hands? "},{"num":7,"verse":"For in a multitude of dreams and in a flood of words there is worthlessness. Rather [reverently] fear God [and worship Him with awe-filled respect, knowing who He is]."},{"num":8,"verse":"If you see the oppression of the poor and the denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight [of corruption]; for a higher official watches over another official, and there are higher ones over them [looking out for one another]. "},{"num":9,"verse":"After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land."},{"header":"The Folly of Riches"},{"num":10,"verse":"He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance with its gain. This too is vanity (emptiness). "},{"num":11,"verse":"When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what advantage is there to their owners except to see them with their eyes? "},{"num":12,"verse":"The sleep of a working man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach (greed) of the rich [who hungers for even more] will not let him sleep."},{"num":13,"verse":"There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches being kept and hoarded by their owner to his own misery. "},{"num":14,"verse":"For when those riches are lost in bad investments and he becomes the father of a son, then there is nothing in his hand [for the support of the child]. "},{"num":15,"verse":"As he came naked from his mother’s womb, so he will return as he came; and he will take away nothing from all his labor that he can carry in his hand. "},{"num":16,"verse":"This also is a grievous evil—exactly as he was born, so he shall die. So what advantage has he who labors for the wind?

"},{"num":19,"verse":"Also, every man to whom God has given riches and possessions, He has also given the power and ability to enjoy them and to receive [this as] his [allotted] portion and to rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God [to him].
