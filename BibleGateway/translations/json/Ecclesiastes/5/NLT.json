It is evil to make mindless offerings to God."},{"num":2,"verse":"Don’t make rash promises, and don’t be hasty in bringing matters before God. After all, God is in heaven, and you are here on earth. So let your words be few."},{"num":3,"verse":"Too much activity gives you restless dreams; too many words make you a fool."},{"num":4,"verse":"When you make a promise to God, don’t delay in following through, for God takes no pleasure in fools. Keep all the promises you make to him."},{"num":5,"verse":"It is better to say nothing than to make a promise and not keep it."},{"num":6,"verse":"Don’t let your mouth make you sin.
