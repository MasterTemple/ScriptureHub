[{"num":5,"verse":"Keep your foot [give your mind to what you are doing] when you go [as Jacob to sacred Bethel] to the house of God.

For God is in heaven, and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few."},{"num":3,"verse":"For a dream comes with much business and painful effort, and a fool’s voice with many words."},{"num":4,"verse":"When you vow a vow or make a pledge to God, do not put off paying it; for God has no pleasure in fools (those who witlessly mock Him). Pay what you vow."},{"num":5,"verse":"It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay."},{"num":6,"verse":"Do not allow your mouth to cause your body to sin, and do not say before the messenger [the priest] that it was an error or mistake.

But [reverently] fear God [revere and worship Him, knowing that He is]."},{"num":8,"verse":"If you see the oppression of the poor and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in the state or province, do not marvel at the matter. [Be sure that there are those who will attend to it] for a higher [official] than the high is observing, and higher ones are over them."},{"num":9,"verse":"Moreover, the profit of the earth is for all; the king himself is served by the field and in all, a king is an advantage to a land with cultivated fields."},{"num":10,"verse":"He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, nor he who loves abundance with gain. This also is vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility)!"},{"num":11,"verse":"When goods increase, they who eat them increase also.
