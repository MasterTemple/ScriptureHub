[{"num":2,"verse":"I said in my mind, Come now, I will prove you with mirth and test you with pleasure; so have a good time [enjoy pleasure]. But this also was vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility)!"},{"num":2,"verse":"I said of laughter, It is mad, and of pleasure, What does it accomplish?"},{"num":3,"verse":"I searched in my mind how to cheer my body with wine—yet at the same time having my mind hold its course and guide me with [human] wisdom—and how to lay hold of folly, till I might see what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives."},{"num":4,"verse":"I made great works; I built myself houses, I planted vineyards."},{"num":5,"verse":"I made for myself gardens and orchards and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees."},{"num":6,"verse":"I made for myself pools of water from which to water the forest and make the trees bud."},{"num":7,"verse":"I bought menservants and maidservants and had servants born in my house. Also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem."},{"num":8,"verse":"I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got for myself men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men—concubines very many."},{"num":9,"verse":"So I became great and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me and stood by me."},{"num":10,"verse":"And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any pleasure, for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my portion and reward for all my toil."},{"num":11,"verse":"Then I looked on all that my hands had done and the labor I had spent in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it, and there was no profit under the sun."},{"num":12,"verse":"So I turned to consider [human] wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the man do who succeeds the king? Nothing but what has been done already."},{"num":13,"verse":"Then I saw that even [human] wisdom [that brings sorrow] is better than [the pleasures of] folly as far as light is better than darkness."},{"num":14,"verse":"The wise man’s eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness; and yet I perceived that [in the end] one event happens to them both."},{"num":15,"verse":"Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it will happen even to me. And of what use is it then for me to be more wise?
