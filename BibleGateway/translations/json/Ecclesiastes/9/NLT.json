[{"header":"Death Comes to All"},{"num":9,"verse":"This, too, I carefully explored: Even though the actions of godly and wise people are in God’s hands, no one knows whether God will show them favor."},{"num":2,"verse":"The same destiny ultimately awaits everyone, whether righteous or wicked, good or bad, ceremonially clean or unclean, religious or irreligious. Good people receive the same treatment as sinners, and people who make promises to God are treated like people who don’t."},{"num":3,"verse":"It seems so wrong that everyone under the sun suffers the same fate. Already twisted by evil, people choose their own mad course, for they have no hope. There is nothing ahead but death anyway."},{"num":4,"verse":"There is hope only for the living.

They have no further reward, nor are they remembered."},{"num":6,"verse":"Whatever they did in their lifetime—loving, hating, envying—is all long gone.

For when you go to the grave, there will be no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom."},{"num":11,"verse":"I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn’t always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don’t always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time."},{"num":12,"verse":"People can never predict when hard times might come.
