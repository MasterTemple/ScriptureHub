[{"header":"The Church Leaders in Jerusalem Say Paul Is a True Missionary"},{"num":2,"verse":"Fourteen years later I went again to Jerusalem. This time I took Barnabas. Titus went with us also. "},{"num":2,"verse":"God showed me in a special way I should go. I spoke to them about the Good News that I preach among the people who are not Jews. First of all, I talked alone to the important church leaders. I wanted them to know what I was preaching. I did not want that which I was doing or would be doing to be wasted."},{"num":3,"verse":"Titus was with me. Even being a Greek, he did not have to go through the religious act of becoming a Jew. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Some men who called themselves Christians asked about this. They got in our meeting without being asked. They came there to find out how free we are who belong to Christ. They tried to get us to be chained to the Law. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But we did not listen to them or do what they wanted us to do so the truth of the Good News might be yours."},{"num":6,"verse":"Those who seemed to be important church leaders did not help me. They did not teach me anything new. What they were, I do not care. God looks on us all as being the same. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Anyway, they saw how I had been given the work of preaching the Good News to the people who are not Jews, as Peter had been given the work of preaching the Good News to the Jews. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For God helped Peter work with the Jews. He also helped me work with those who are not Jews. "},{"num":9,"verse":"James and Peter and John were thought of as being the head church leaders. They could see that God’s loving-favor had been given to me. Barnabas and I were joined together with them by shaking hands. Then we were sent off to work with the people who are not Jews. They were to work with the Jews. "},{"num":10,"verse":"They asked us to do only one thing. We were to remember to help poor people. I think this is important also."},{"num":11,"verse":"But when Peter came to Antioch, I had to stand up against him because he was guilty. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Peter had been eating with the people who are not Jews. But after some men came who had been with James, he kept away from them. He was afraid of those who believe in the religious act of becoming a Jew. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Then the rest of the Jews followed him because they were afraid to do what they knew they should do. Even Barnabas was fooled by those who pretended to be someone they were not. "},{"num":14,"verse":"When I saw they were not honest about the truth of the Good News, I spoke to Peter in front of them all. I said, “If you are a Jew, but live like the people who are not Jews, why do you make the people who are not Jews live like the Jews?” "},{"num":15,"verse":"You and I were born Jews. We were not sinners from among the people who are not Jews. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Even so, we know we cannot become right with God by obeying the Law. A man is made right with God by putting his trust in Jesus Christ. For that reason, we have put our trust in Jesus Christ also. We have been made right with God because of our faith in Christ and not by obeying the Law. No man can be made right with God by obeying the Law. "},{"num":17,"verse":"As we try to become right with God by what Christ has done for us, what if we find we are sinners also? Does that mean Christ makes us sinners? No! Never! "},{"num":18,"verse":"But if I work toward being made right with God by keeping the Law, then I make myself a sinner. "},{"num":19,"verse":"The Law has no power over me. I am dead to the Law. Now I can live for God. "},{"num":20,"verse":"I have been put up on the cross to die with Christ. I no longer live. Christ lives in me. The life I now live in this body, I live by putting my trust in the Son of God. He was the One Who loved me and gave Himself for me. "},{"num":21,"verse":"I say that we are not to put aside the loving-favor of God. If we could be made right with God by keeping the Law, then Christ died for nothing."}]
