[{"num":2,"verse":"Then after fourteen years I again went up to Yerushalayim, this time with Bar-Nabba; and I took with me Titus. "},{"num":2,"verse":"I went up in obedience to a revelation, and I explained to them the Good News as I proclaim it among the Gentiles — but privately, to the acknowledged leaders. I did this out of concern that my current or previous work might have been in vain."},{"num":3,"verse":"But they didn’t force my Gentile companion Titus to undergo b’rit-milah. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Indeed, the question came up only because some men who pretended to be brothers had been sneaked in — they came in surreptitiously to spy out the freedom we have in the Messiah Yeshua, so that they might enslave us. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Not even for a minute did we give in to them, so that the truth of the Good News might be preserved for you."},{"num":6,"verse":"Moreover, those who were the acknowledged leaders — what they were makes no difference to me; God does not judge by outward appearances — these leaders added nothing to me. "},{"num":7,"verse":"On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the Uncircumcised, just as Kefa had been for the Circumcised; "},{"num":8,"verse":"since the One working in Kefa to make him an emissary to the Circumcised had worked in me to make me an emissary to the Gentiles. "},{"num":9,"verse":"So, having perceived what grace had been given to me, Ya‘akov, Kefa and Yochanan, the acknowledged pillars of the community, extended to me and Bar-Nabba the right hand of fellowship; so that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the Circumcised.

Therefore, we too have put our trust in Messiah Yeshua and become faithful to him, in order that we might be declared righteous on the ground of the Messiah’s trusting faithfulness and not on the ground of our legalistic observance of Torah commands. For on the ground of legalistic observance of Torah commands, no one will be declared righteous."},{"num":17,"verse":"But if, in seeking to be declared righteous by God through our union with the Messiah, we ourselves are indeed found to be sinners, then is the Messiah an aider and abettor of sin?
