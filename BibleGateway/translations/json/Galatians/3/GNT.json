The scripture does not use the plural “descendants,” meaning many people, but the singular “descendant,” meaning one person only, namely, Christ.

The Law, which was given four hundred and thirty years later, cannot break that covenant and cancel God's promise.

However, it was because of his promise that God gave that gift to Abraham."},{"num":19,"verse":"What, then, was the purpose of the Law? It was added in order to show what wrongdoing is, and it was meant to last until the coming of Abraham's descendant, to whom the promise was made.
