Birds came and ate the seed."},{"num":5,"verse":"Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much earth covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground."},{"num":6,"verse":"When the sun began to shine, it was too hot for the new plants. They died because they had no roots."},{"num":7,"verse":"Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die."},{"num":8,"verse":"But some seed fell on good ground. The seed grew and the plants gave more seed. Some plants gave thirty seeds. Some gave sixty. And some gave a hundred."},{"num":9,"verse":"Everyone who has ears, listen!'"},{"num":10,"verse":"The disciples came to Jesus and asked him, `Why do you tell the people these stories?'"},{"num":11,"verse":"Jesus answered them, `You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of heaven.
