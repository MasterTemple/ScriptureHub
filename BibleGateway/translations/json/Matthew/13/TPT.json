[{"header":"The Parables of Jesus"},{"num":13,"verse":"Later that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeshore to teach the people. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Soon, there were so many people surrounding him that he had to teach sitting in a boat while the large crowd stood on the shore. "},{"num":3,"verse":"He taught them many things by using stories, parables to illustrate spiritual truths, saying:"},{"num":4,"verse":"As he cast his seeds, some fell along the beaten path and the birds came and ate them. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Others fell onto gravel that had no topsoil. They quickly shot up, "},{"num":6,"verse":"but when the days grew hot, they were scorched and withered because they had insufficient roots. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Others fell among the thorns, so when they sprouted, the thorns choked them. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But other seeds fell on good, rich soil that kept producing a good harvest. Some yielded thirty, some sixty, and some even one hundred times as much as he planted! "},{"num":9,"verse":"If you’re able to understand this, then you need to respond.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Then his disciples approached Jesus and asked, “Why do you always speak to people in these hard-to-understand parables?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"He explained, “You’ve been given the intimate experience of insight into the hidden mysteries of the realm of heaven’s kingdom, but they have not. "},{"num":12,"verse":"For everyone who listens with an open heart will receive progressively more revelation until he has more than enough. But those who don’t listen with an open, teachable heart, even the understanding that they think they have will be taken from them. "},{"num":13,"verse":"That’s why I teach the people using parables, because they think they’re looking for truth, yet because their hearts are unteachable, they never discover it. Although they will listen to me, they never fully perceive the message I speak. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The prophecy of Isaiah describes them perfectly:"},{"num":16,"verse":"“But blissful are your eyes, for they see. Delighted are your ears, for they are open to hear all these things. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Many prophets and godly people yearned to see these days of miracles that you’ve been favored to see.

"},{"num":21,"verse":"Shortly after he hears it, troubles and persecutions come because of the kingdom message he received. Then he quickly falls away, for the truth didn’t sink deeply into his heart."},{"num":22,"verse":"“The one sown among thorns represents one who receives the message, but all of life’s busy distractions, his divided heart, and his ambition for wealth result in suffocating the kingdom message and it becomes fruitless."},{"num":23,"verse":"“But what was sown on good, rich soil represents the one who hears and fully embraces the message of the kingdom.

Where did all these weeds come from?’"},{"num":28,"verse":"“He answered, ‘This has to be the work of an enemy!’"},{"num":29,"verse":"“ ‘No,’ he said. ‘If you pull out the weeds you might uproot the wheat at the same time.

Then his disciples approached him and asked, “Please explain the deeper meaning of the parable of the weeds growing in the field of wheat.”"},{"num":37,"verse":"He answered, “The man who sowed his field with good seed is the Son of Man. "},{"num":38,"verse":"And the field is the world. The good seeds I sow are the children of the kingdom realm. The weeds are the children of the Evil One, "},{"num":39,"verse":"and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest points to the end of this age, and the harvesters are God’s messengers. "},{"num":40,"verse":"As the weeds are bundled up and thrown into the fire, so it will be at the close of the age. "},{"num":41,"verse":"The Son of Man will send his messengers, and they will uproot everything out of his kingdom. All the lawless ones and everything that causes sin will be removed. "},{"num":42,"verse":"And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where they will experience great sorrow and anguish.
