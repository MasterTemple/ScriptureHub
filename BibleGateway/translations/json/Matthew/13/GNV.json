"},{"num":4,"verse":"And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And some fell upon stony ground, where they had not much earth, and anon they sprung up, because they had no depth of earth. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And when the sun was up, they were parched, and for lack of rooting withered away. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up, and choked them.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"So in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which prophecy saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive. "},{"num":15,"verse":"For this people’s heart is waxed fat, and their ears are dull of hearing, and with their eyes they have winked, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their hearts, and should return, that I might heal them. "},{"num":16,"verse":"But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. "},{"num":17,"verse":"For verily I say unto you, that many Prophets, and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. "},{"num":18,"verse":"¶ Hear ye therefore the parable of the Sower. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Whensoever any man heareth the word of that kingdom, and understandeth it not, that evil one cometh, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart: and this is he which hath received the seed by the way side. "},{"num":20,"verse":"And he that received seed in the stony ground, is he which heareth the word, and incontinently with joy receiveth it, "},{"num":21,"verse":"Yet hath he no root in himself, and endureth but a season: for as soon as tribulation or persecution cometh because of the word, by and by he is offended.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"But while men slept, there came his enemy and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. "},{"num":26,"verse":"And when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Then came the servants of the householder, and said unto him, Master, sowest thou not good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? "},{"num":28,"verse":"And he said unto them, Some envious man hath done this. Then the servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

"},{"num":30,"verse":"Let both grow together until the harvest, and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye first the tares, and bind them in sheaves to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. "},{"num":31,"verse":"¶ Another parable he put forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man taketh and soweth in his field: "},{"num":32,"verse":"Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and it is a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and build in the branches thereof. "},{"num":33,"verse":"¶ Another parable spake he to them, The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman taketh and hideth in three pecks of meal, till all be leavened. "},{"num":34,"verse":"¶ All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables, and without parables spake he not unto them,"},{"num":35,"verse":"That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, and will utter the things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world."},{"num":36,"verse":"Then sent Jesus the multitude away, and went into the house. And his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of that field."},{"num":37,"verse":"Then answered he, and said to them, He that soweth the good seed, is the son of man, "},{"num":38,"verse":"And the field is the world, and the good seed are the children of the kingdom, and the tares are the children of that wicked one. "},{"num":39,"verse":"And the enemy that soweth them, is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers be the Angels. "},{"num":40,"verse":"As then the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the end of this world. "},{"num":41,"verse":"The Son of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, "},{"num":42,"verse":"And shall cast them into a furnace of fire. There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. "},{"num":43,"verse":"Then shall the just men shine as the sun in the kingdom of their father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. "},{"num":44,"verse":"¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hid in the field, which when a man hath found, he hideth it, and for joy thereof departeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. "},{"num":45,"verse":"¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant man that seeketh good pearls, "},{"num":46,"verse":"Who having found a pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it. "},{"num":47,"verse":"¶ Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a draw net cast into the sea, that gathereth of all kinds of things.
