That’s when the Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over for crucifixion.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"At that very moment, the party of high priests and religious leaders was meeting in the chambers of the Chief Priest named Caiaphas, conspiring to seize Jesus by stealth and kill him. They agreed that it should not be done during Passover Week. “We don’t want a riot on our hands,” they said."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When Jesus was at Bethany, a guest of Simon the Leper, a woman came up to him as he was eating dinner and anointed him with a bottle of very expensive perfume. When the disciples saw what was happening, they were furious. “That’s criminal! This could have been sold for a lot and the money handed out to the poor.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When Jesus realized what was going on, he intervened. “Why are you giving this woman a hard time? She has just done something wonderfully significant for me. You will have the poor with you every day for the rest of your lives, but not me. When she poured this perfume on my body, what she really did was anoint me for burial. You can be sure that wherever in the whole world the Message is preached, what she has just done is going to be remembered and admired.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"That is when one of the Twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the cabal of high priests and said, “What will you give me if I hand him over to you?” They settled on thirty silver pieces.

In one sense the Son of Man is entering into a way of treachery well-marked by the Scriptures—no surprises here. In another sense that man who turns him in, turns traitor to the Son of Man—better never to have been born than do this!”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then Judas, already turned traitor, said, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?”Jesus said, “Don’t play games with me, Judas.”"}],[{"type":"header","content":"The Bread and the Cup"},{"type":"prose","content":"During the meal, Jesus took and blessed the bread, broke it, and gave it to his disciples:"},{"type":"poetry","content":"Take, eat."},{"type":"poetry","content":"This is my body."},{"type":"prose","content":"Taking the cup and thanking God, he gave it to them:"},{"type":"poetry","content":"Drink this, all of you."},{"type":"poetry","content":"This is my blood,"},{"type":"poetry","content":"God’s new covenant poured out for many people"},{"type":"prose","content":"“I’ll not be drinking wine from this cup again until that new day when I’ll drink with you in the kingdom of my Father.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"They sang a hymn and went directly to Mount Olives."}],[{"type":"header","content":"Gethsemane"},{"type":"prose","content":"Then Jesus told them, “Before the night’s over, you’re going to fall to pieces because of what happens to me.

Then he said, “This sorrow is crushing my life out. Stay here and keep vigil with me.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Going a little ahead, he fell on his face, praying, “My Father, if there is any way, get me out of this. But please, not what I want. You, what do  want?”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When he came back to his disciples, he found them sound asleep. He said to Peter, “Can’t you stick it out with me a single hour? Stay alert; be in prayer so you don’t wander into temptation without even knowing you’re in danger. There is a part of you that is eager, ready for anything in God. But there’s another part that’s as lazy as an old dog sleeping by the fire.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He then left them a second time. Again he prayed, “My Father, if there is no other way than this, drinking this cup to the dregs, I’m ready. Do it your way.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When he came back, he again found them sound asleep. They simply couldn’t keep their eyes open.

My time is up, the Son of Man is about to be handed over to the hands of sinners. Get up! Let’s get going! My betrayer is here.”"}],[{"type":"header","content":"With Swords and Clubs"},{"type":"prose","content":"The words were barely out of his mouth when Judas (the one from the Twelve) showed up, and with him a gang from the high priests and religious leaders brandishing swords and clubs.

One of those with Jesus pulled his sword and, taking a swing at the Chief Priest’s servant, cut off his ear."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Jesus said, “Put your sword back where it belongs. All who use swords are destroyed by swords. Don’t you realize that I am able right now to call to my Father, and twelve companies—more, if I want them—of fighting angels would be here, battle-ready? But if I did that, how would the Scriptures come true that say this is the way it has to be?”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then Jesus addressed the mob: “What is this—coming out after me with swords and clubs as if I were a dangerous criminal? Day after day I have been sitting in the Temple teaching, and you never so much as lifted a hand against me.

Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” He went out and cried and cried and cried."}]]
