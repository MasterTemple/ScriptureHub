But I will not use it for you. I will give it to God.’"},{"num":6,"verse":"You are teaching them not to respect their father. So you are teaching that it is not important to do what God said. You think it is more important to follow those traditions you have."},{"num":7,"verse":"You are hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he spoke for God about you:"},{"num":10,"verse":"Jesus called the people to him.

And that’s what can make people wrong."},{"num":19,"verse":"All these bad things begin in the mind: evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual sins, stealing, lying, and insulting people."},{"num":20,"verse":"These are the things that make people wrong.
