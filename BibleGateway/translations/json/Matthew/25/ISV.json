"},{"num":2,"verse":"Now five of them were foolish, and five were wise, "},{"num":3,"verse":"because when the foolish ones took their lamps, they didn’t take any oil with them. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But the wise ones took flasks of oil with their lamps. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Since the groom was late, all of them became sleepy and lay down. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But at midnight there came a shout: ‘The groom is here! Come out to meet him!’ "},{"num":7,"verse":"Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready."},{"num":8,"verse":"“But the foolish ones told the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out!’"},{"num":9,"verse":"“But the wise ones replied, ‘No! There will never be enough for us and for you. You’d better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’"},{"num":10,"verse":"“While they were away buying it, the groom arrived. Those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet, and the door was closed. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Later, the other bridesmaids arrived and said, ‘Lord, lord, open up for us!’"},{"num":12,"verse":"“But he replied, ‘I tell all of you with certainty, I don’t know you!’ "},{"num":13,"verse":"So keep on watching, because you don’t know the day or the hour.”"},{"header":"The Parable about the Talents"},{"num":14,"verse":"“Similarly, it is like a man going on a trip, who called his servants and turned his money over to them. "},{"num":15,"verse":"To one man he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, based on their ability. Then he went on his trip."},{"num":16,"verse":"“The one who received five talents went out at once and invested them and earned five more. "},{"num":17,"verse":"In the same way, the one who had two talents earned two more. "},{"num":18,"verse":"But the one who received one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and buried his master’s money."},{"num":19,"verse":"“After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. "},{"num":20,"verse":"The one who had received five talents came up and brought five more talents. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you gave me five talents. See, I’ve earned five more talents.’"},{"num":21,"verse":"“His master told him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy servant! Since you’ve been trustworthy with a small amount, I’ll put you in charge of a large amount. Come and share your master’s joy!’"},{"num":22,"verse":"“The one with two talents also came forward and said, ‘Master, you gave me two talents.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"Since I was afraid, I went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here, take what’s yours!’"},{"num":26,"verse":"“His master answered him, ‘You evil and lazy servant! So you knew that I harvested where I haven’t planted and gathered where I haven’t scattered any seed? "},{"num":27,"verse":"Then you should’ve invested my money with the bankers. When I returned, I would’ve received my money back with interest.’ "},{"num":28,"verse":"Then the master said, ‘Take the talent from him and give it to the man who has the ten talents, "},{"num":29,"verse":"because to everyone who has something, more will be given, and he’ll have more than enough. But from the person who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him. "},{"num":30,"verse":"Throw this useless servant into the darkness outside! In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”"},{"header":"The Judgment of the Nations"},{"num":31,"verse":"“When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels are with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.

Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world, "},{"num":35,"verse":"because I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me. "},{"num":36,"verse":"I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you took care of me.
