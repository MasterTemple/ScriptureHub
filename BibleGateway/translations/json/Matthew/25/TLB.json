[{"num":25,"verse":"“The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.

Come out and welcome him!’"},{"num":7,"verse":"“All the girls jumped up and trimmed their lamps. Then the five who hadn’t any oil begged the others to share with them, for their lamps were going out."},{"num":9,"verse":"“But the others replied, ‘We haven’t enough. Go instead to the shops and buy some for yourselves.’"},{"num":10,"verse":"“But while they were gone, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was locked."},{"num":11,"verse":"“Later, when the other five returned, they stood outside, calling, ‘Sir, open the door for us!’"},{"num":12,"verse":"“But he called back, ‘Go away! It is too late!’"},{"num":13,"verse":"“So stay awake and be prepared, for you do not know the date or moment of my return."},{"num":14,"verse":"“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a man going into another country, who called together his servants and loaned them money to invest for him while he was gone."},{"num":15,"verse":"“He gave $5,000 to one, $2,000 to another, and $1,000 to the last—dividing it in proportion to their abilities—and then left on his trip.

Begin the joyous tasks I have assigned to you.’"},{"num":22,"verse":"“Next came the man who had received the $2,000, with the report, ‘Sir, you gave me $2,000 to use, and I have doubled it.’"},{"num":23,"verse":"“‘Good work,’ his master said. ‘You are a good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over this small amount, so now I will give you much more.’"},{"num":24,"verse":"“Then the man with the $1,000 came and said, ‘Sir, I knew you were a hard man, and I was afraid you would rob me of what I earned, so I hid your money in the earth and here it is!’"},{"num":26,"verse":"“But his master replied, ‘Wicked man!
