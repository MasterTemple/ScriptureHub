Only the priests were allowed to eat it."},{"num":5,"verse":"And you have read in the Law of Moses that on every Sabbath day the priests at the Temple break the law about the Sabbath day. But they are not wrong for doing that."},{"num":6,"verse":"I tell you that there is something here that is greater than the Temple."},{"num":7,"verse":"The Scriptures say, ‘I don’t want animal sacrifices; I want you to show kindness to people.’ You don’t really know what that means.
