Then every man who had a dispute could come to me and I would get justice for him.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"And whenever a man approached to bow down before him, he would put out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"This is how Absalom dealt with everyone in Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel."},{"num":7,"verse":"And after four years, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to the Lord at Hebron [my birthplace].
