"},{"num":7,"verse":"Now ·all the family group [the whole family/clan] ·is [has risen] against me. They said to me, ‘·Bring [Hand over; Give up] the son who ·killed [struck] his brother so we may ·kill [execute] him for ·killing [murdering; taking the life of] his brother. That way we will ·also get rid of the one who would receive what belonged to his father [destroy the heir as well; so he doesn’t profit from his crime].’ ·My son is like the last spark of a fire. He is all [They want to extinguish/quench the only coal/ember] I have left. ·If they kill him, my [My] husband’s name and ·property [or family; descendents; remnant] will be gone from the ·earth [face of the earth].”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then the king said to the woman, “Go home. I will ·take care of this for [give orders concerning] you.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"The woman of Tekoa said to him, “Let the ·blame [guilt] be on me and my father’s family.
