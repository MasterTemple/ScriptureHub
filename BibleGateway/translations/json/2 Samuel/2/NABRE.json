"},{"num":3,"verse":"David also brought up his men with their families, and they dwelt in the towns of Hebron. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the men of Judah came there and anointed David king over the house of Judah."},{"num":5,"verse":"So David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh-gilead and said to them: “May you be blessed by the Lord for having done this kindness to your lord Saul in burying him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And now may the Lord show you kindness and fidelity. For my part, I will show generosity to you for having done this. "},{"num":7,"verse":"So take courage and prove yourselves valiant, for though your lord Saul is dead, the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Ishbaal King of Israel. Abner, son of Ner, captain of Saul’s army, took Ishbaal, son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim, "},{"num":9,"verse":"where he made him king over Gilead, the Asherites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and the rest of Israel. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Ishbaal, son of Saul, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years; but the house of Judah followed David.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"Joab, son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David also set out and encountered them at the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, one group on one side of the pool and the other on the opposite side. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Then Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men rise and perform for us.” Joab replied, “All right.” "},{"num":15,"verse":"So they rose and were counted off: twelve of the Benjaminites of Ishbaal, son of Saul, and twelve of David’s servants. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Then each one grasped his opponent’s head and thrust his sword into his opponent’s side, and they all fell down together.

The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David’s servants. "},{"num":18,"verse":"The three sons of Zeruiah were there—Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.

"},{"num":20,"verse":"Abner turned around and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” He replied, “Yes.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Abner said to him, “Turn right or left; seize one of the young men and take what you can strip from him.” But Asahel would not stop pursuing him.

How could I show my face to your brother Joab?” "},{"num":23,"verse":"Still he refused to stop. So Abner struck him in the abdomen with the heel of his spear, and the weapon protruded from his back.
