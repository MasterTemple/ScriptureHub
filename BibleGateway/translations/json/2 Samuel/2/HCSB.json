[{"header":"David, King of Judah"},{"num":2,"verse":"Some time later, David inquired of the Lord: “Should I go to one of the towns of Judah?”"},{"num":2,"verse":"So David went there with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail, the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. "},{"num":3,"verse":"In addition, David brought the men who were with him, each one with his household, and they settled in the towns near Hebron. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David: “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, “The Lord bless you, because you have shown this kindness to Saul your lord when you buried him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Now, may the Lord show kindness and faithfulness to you, and I will also show the same goodness to you because you have done this deed. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Therefore, be strong and courageous, for though Saul your lord is dead, the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, took Saul’s son Ish-bosheth and moved him to Mahanaim.

"},{"num":18,"verse":"The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was a fast runner, like one of the wild gazelles.
