From the roof he saw a woman bathing. Now this woman was very attractive. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So David sent someone to inquire about the woman. The messenger said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”"},{"num":4,"verse":"David sent some messengers to get her. She came to him and he went to bed with her. (Now at that time she was in the process of purifying herself from her menstrual uncleanness.) Then she returned to her home. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The woman conceived and then sent word to David saying, “I’m pregnant.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So David sent a message to Joab that said, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David.
