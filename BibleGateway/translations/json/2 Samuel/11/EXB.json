"},{"num":2,"verse":"One ·evening [afternoon] David got up from his ·bed [midday rest] and walked around on the roof [the flat roofs of Israelite houses were used for living space] of ·his palace [the king’s house]. While he was on the roof, he saw a woman bathing. She was very beautiful. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So David sent his servants to find out who she was. A servant answered, “That woman is Bathsheba daughter of Eliam.

When she came to him, he ·had sexual relations [lay] with her. (Now Bathsheba had purified herself from her ·monthly period [uncleanness; Lev. 15:19–24].) Then she went back to her house. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But Bathsheba ·became pregnant [conceived] and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So David sent a message to Joab: “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.” And Joab sent Uriah to David.

My ·master [lord; commander] Joab and his officers are camping out in the fields. ·It isn’t right for me to [How can I…?] go home to eat and drink and ·have sexual relations [lie] with my wife [thus rendering himself ritually unclean and unable to go into the presence of the Ark; Lev. 15:16–18]!”"},{"num":12,"verse":"David said to Uriah, “Stay here today. Tomorrow I’ll send you back to the battle.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Then David called Uriah to come to see him, so Uriah ate and drank with David.

"},{"num":21,"verse":"Do you remember who killed Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth [another name for Gideon]? It was a woman on the city wall. She threw a large stone for grinding grain on Abimelech and killed him there in Thebez [Judg. 9:50–57]. Why did you go so near the wall?’ If King David asks that, tell him, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.’”"},{"num":22,"verse":"The messenger left and went to David and told him everything Joab had told him to say. "},{"num":23,"verse":"The messenger told David, “The men of Ammon were ·winning [gaining an advantage over us].
