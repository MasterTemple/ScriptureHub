David and the whole company of Israel were in the parade, singing at the top of their lungs and playing mandolins, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.

He chose me over your father and the rest of our family and made me prince over ’s people, over Israel. Oh yes, I’ll dance to ’s glory—more recklessly even than this.
