But the king is as an angel of God; so do what is good in your eyes."},{"num":28,"verse":"For all of my father’s house were but doomed to death before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table.

I say, You and Ziba divide the land."},{"num":30,"verse":"Mephibosheth said to the king, Oh, let him take it all, since my lord the king has returned home in safety and peace."},{"num":31,"verse":"Now Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went on to the Jordan with the king to conduct him over the Jordan."},{"num":32,"verse":"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old; and he had provided the king with food while he remained at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man."},{"num":33,"verse":"And the king said to Barzillai, Come over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem."},{"num":34,"verse":"And Barzillai said to the king, How much longer have I to live, that it would be worthwhile for me to go up with the king to Jerusalem?"},{"num":35,"verse":"I am this day eighty years old. Could I now [be useful as a counselor to] discern between good and evil? Can your servant appreciate what I eat or drink? Can I any longer enjoy the voices of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be still a burden to my lord the king?"},{"num":36,"verse":"Your servant will only go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?"},{"num":37,"verse":"Let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city and be buried by the grave of my father and mother.
