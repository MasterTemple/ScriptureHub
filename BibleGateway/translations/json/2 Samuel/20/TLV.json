[{"header":"Joab the Terminator"},{"num":20,"verse":"Now a worthless fellow happened to be there, a Benjamite named Sheba son of Bichri. He blew the shofar and said, “We have no portion in David, no inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to his tents, O Israel!” "},{"num":2,"verse":"So all the men of Israel withdrew from following David and followed Sheba son of Bichri, but the men of Judah kept close to their king from the Jordan to Jerusalem."},{"num":3,"verse":"Now when David arrived at his palace in Jerusalem, the king took the ten women, the concubines whom he had left to take care of the palace, and put them in a guarded house. He provided for them but he did not cohabit with them.

"},{"num":8,"verse":"When they were at the great stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was dressed in his military uniform, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened on his waist; and as he stepped forward, it fell out.

So when the man saw that all the people stood still, he dragged Amasa from the highway into the field and threw a garment over him because he saw that everyone passing by him paused. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Once he removed him from the highway, everyone passed on, following Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bichri."},{"num":14,"verse":"Now he went through all the tribes of Israel, to Abel and Beth-Maacah. All the Berites gathered together and indeed followed him. "},{"num":15,"verse":"They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-Maacah and cast up a siege ramp against the city.
