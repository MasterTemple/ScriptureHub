"},{"num":3,"verse":"But the poor man had nothing except for a little lamb he had acquired. He raised it, and it grew up alongside him and his children.

It was just like a daughter to him."},{"num":4,"verse":"“When a traveler arrived at the rich man’s home, he did not want to use one of his own sheep or cattle to feed the traveler who had come to visit him.

While the child was still alive, you fasted and wept. Once the child was dead you got up and ate food!” "},{"num":22,"verse":"He replied, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept because I thought, ‘Perhaps the Lord will show pity and the child will live.’ "},{"num":23,"verse":"But now he is dead.
