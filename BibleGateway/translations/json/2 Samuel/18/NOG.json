[{"header":"David Defeats Absalom"},{"num":18,"verse":"David called together the troops that were with him. He appointed commanders in charge of regiments and battalions. "},{"num":2,"verse":"David put a third of the troops under Joab’s command, another third under Joab’s brother Abishai (Zeruiah’s son), and the last third under Ittai from Gath."},{"num":3,"verse":"“You’re not going with us,” the troops said. “If we flee, they won’t care about us, and if half of us die, they won’t care either. But you’re worth 10,000 of us. It’s better for you to be ready to send us help from the city.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"“I’ll do what you think best,” the king responded. So the king stood by the gate while all the troops marched out by battalions and regiments."},{"num":5,"verse":"The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.” All the troops heard him give all the commanders this order regarding Absalom."},{"num":6,"verse":"So the troops went out to the country to fight Israel in the forest of Ephraim. "},{"num":7,"verse":"There David’s men defeated Israel’s army, and the massacre was sizable that day—20,000 men. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The fighting spread over the whole country. That day the woods devoured more people than the battle."},{"num":9,"verse":"Absalom happened to come face to face with some of David’s men. He was riding on a mule, and the mule went under the tangled branches of a large tree. Absalom’s head became caught in the tree. So he was left hanging in midair when the mule that was under him ran away. "},{"num":10,"verse":"A man who saw this told Joab, “I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"“What! You saw that!” Joab said to the man who told him. “Why didn’t you strike him to the ground? Then I would have felt obligated to give you four ounces of silver and a belt.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"But the man told Joab, “Even if I felt the weight of 25 pounds of silver in my hand, I wouldn’t raise my hand against the king’s son. We heard the order the king gave you, Abishai, and Ittai: ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.’ "},{"num":13,"verse":"If I had done something treacherous to him, would you have stood by me? Like everything else, it wouldn’t stay hidden from the king.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Then Joab said, “I shouldn’t waste time with you like this.” He took three sharp sticks and plunged them into Absalom’s heart while he was still alive in the tree. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Then ten of Joab’s armorbearers surrounded Absalom, attacked him, and killed him."},{"num":16,"verse":"Joab blew the ram’s horn to stop their fighting, and the troops returned from pursuing Israel.

Meanwhile, all Israel fled and went back to their homes."},{"num":18,"verse":"(While he was still living, Absalom had taken a rock and set it up for himself in the king’s valley. He said, “I have no son to keep the memory of my name alive.” He called the rock by his name, and it is still called Absalom’s Monument today.)"},{"num":19,"verse":"Then Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, said, “Let me run and bring the king the good news that Yahweh has freed him from his enemies.”"},{"num":20,"verse":"But Joab told him, “You won’t be the man carrying good news today. You can carry the news some other day. You must not deliver the news today because the king’s son is dead.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Then Joab said to a man from Sudan, “Go, tell the king what you saw.” The messenger bowed down with his face touching the ground in front of Joab and then ran off."},{"num":22,"verse":"Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, spoke to Joab again, “Whatever may happen, I also want to run after the Sudanese messenger.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"“Whatever happens, I’d like to run,” replied Ahimaaz."},{"num":24,"verse":"David was sitting between the two gates while the watchman walked along the roof of the gate by the wall. As he looked, he saw a man running alone.

Ahimaaz said, “May Yahweh your Elohim be praised. He has handed over the men who rebelled against Your Majesty.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"“Is the young man Absalom alright?” the king asked."},{"num":30,"verse":"“Step aside, and stand here,” the king said. He stepped aside and stood there."},{"num":31,"verse":"Then the Sudanese messenger came. “Good news for Your Majesty!” he said. “Today Yahweh has freed you from all who turned against you.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"“Is the young man Absalom alright?” the king asked."},{"num":33,"verse":"The king was shaken by the news.
