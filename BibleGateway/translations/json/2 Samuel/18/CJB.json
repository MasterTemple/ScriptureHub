[{"num":18,"verse":"David took a census of the people who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and of hundreds. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Then David dispatched the people, a third of them under the command of Yo’av, a third under Avishai the son of Tz’ruyah, Yo’av’s brother, and a third under Ittai the Gitti; and the king said to the people, “I will also go out with you, myself.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"But the people replied, “Don’t go out; because if we flee, they won’t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won’t care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; so it is better now that you stay in the city and be ready if we need help.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"The king answered them, “I will do whatever you think best.” So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The king gave orders to Yo’av, Avishai and Ittai, “For my sake, deal gently with young Avshalom.” All the people were listening when the king gave all the commanders this order concerning Avshalom."},{"num":6,"verse":"So the people went out into the field against Isra’el; the battle took place in the forest of Efrayim. "},{"num":7,"verse":"The people of Isra’el were defeated there by David’s servants; there was a terrible slaughter that day of 20,000 men. "},{"num":8,"verse":"For the battle there was spread all over the countryside; the forest devoured more people that day than did the sword."},{"num":9,"verse":"Avshalom happened to meet some of David’s servants. Avshalom was riding his mule, and as the mule walked under the thick branches of a big terebinth tree, his head got caught in the terebinth, so that he was left hanging between earth and sky, as the mule went on from under him. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Someone saw it and told Yo’av, “I saw Avshalom hanging in a terebinth.” "},{"num":11,"verse":"Yo’av asked the man who told him, “Here now, you saw it; so why didn’t you strike him to the ground then and there?

"},{"num":18,"verse":"In his own lifetime Avshalom had taken and raised for himself the pillar which stands in the King’s Valley; because he said, “I don’t have a son to preserve the memory of my name.” So he named the pillar after himself, and it’s called Avshalom’s Monument to this day."},{"num":19,"verse":"Then Achima‘atz the son of Tzadok said, “Let me run now and bring news to the king that Adonai has judged in his favor by releasing him from his enemies.” "},{"num":20,"verse":"Yo’av said to him, “You are not to be the one to bring the news today; you can convey news another day; but today you will not bring news, because the king’s son is dead.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Then Yo’av said to the Ethiopian, “Go, tell the king what you saw.” The Ethiopian bowed to Yo’av, then ran off. "},{"num":22,"verse":"But Achima‘atz the son of Tzadok said again to Yo’av, “Come what may, please let me also run after the Ethiopian.” Yo’av answered, “Why do you want to run, my son? You won’t receive any reward for bringing the news.” "},{"num":23,"verse":"“I don’t care — whatever happens, I want to run.” So he said to him, “Run.” Then Achima‘atz ran by the road through the desert flats and outran the Ethiopian."},{"num":24,"verse":"David was sitting between the two gates.
