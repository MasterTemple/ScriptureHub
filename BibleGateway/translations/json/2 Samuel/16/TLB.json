[{"num":16,"verse":"David was just past the top of the hill when Ziba, the manager of Mephibosheth’s household, caught up with him. He was leading two donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, one hundred bunches of grapes, and a small barrel of wine."},{"num":2,"verse":"“What are these for?” the king asked Ziba."},{"num":3,"verse":"“And where is Mephibosheth?” the king asked him."},{"num":4,"verse":"“In that case,” the king told Ziba, “I give you everything he owns.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"As David and his party passed Bahurim, a man came out of the village cursing them. It was Shimei, the son of Gera, a member of Saul’s family. "},{"num":6,"verse":"He threw stones at the king and the king’s officers and all the mighty warriors who surrounded them!"},{"num":7,"verse":"“Get out of here, you murderer, you scoundrel!” he shouted at David. “The Lord is paying you back for murdering King Saul and his family; you stole his throne and now the Lord has given it to your son Absalom! At last you will taste some of your own medicine, you murderer!”"},{"num":9,"verse":"“Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?” Abishai demanded. “Let me go over and strike off his head!”"},{"num":10,"verse":"“No!” the king said. “If the Lord has told him to curse me, who am I to say no? "},{"num":11,"verse":"My own son is trying to kill me, and this Benjaminite is merely cursing me. Leave him alone, for no doubt the Lord has told him to do it. "},{"num":12,"verse":"And perhaps the Lord will see that I am being wronged and will bless me because of these curses.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"So David and his men continued on, and Shimei kept pace with them on a nearby hillside, cursing as he went and throwing stones at David and tossing dust into the air.

Then all Israel will know that you have insulted him beyond the possibility of reconciliation, and they will all close ranks behind you.”"},{"num":22,"verse":"So a tent was erected on the roof of the palace where everybody could see it, and Absalom went into the tent to lie with his father’s wives.
