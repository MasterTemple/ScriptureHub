[{"num":16,"verse":"When David was a little past the top [of Olivet], behold, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, met him with a couple of donkeys saddled, and upon them 200 loaves of bread, 100 bunches of raisins, 100 summer fruits, and a skin of wine."},{"num":2,"verse":"The king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those to drink who become faint in the wilderness."},{"num":3,"verse":"The king said, And where is your master’s son [grandson Mephibosheth]? Ziba said to the king, Behold, he remains in Jerusalem, for he said, Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father [grandfather Saul]."},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the king said to Ziba, Behold, all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours. Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me ever find favor in your sight, my lord O king."},{"num":5,"verse":"When King David came to Bahurim, a man of the family of the house of Saul, Shimei son of Gera, came out and cursed continually as he came."},{"num":6,"verse":"And he cast stones at David and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left."},{"num":7,"verse":"Shimei said as he cursed, Get out, get out, you man of blood, you base fellow!"},{"num":8,"verse":"The Lord has avenged upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you have reigned; and the Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hands of Absalom your son. Behold, the calamity is upon you because you are a bloody man!"},{"num":9,"verse":"Then said [David’s nephew] Abishai son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head."},{"num":10,"verse":"The king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the Lord said to him, Curse David, who then shall ask, Why have you done so?"},{"num":11,"verse":"And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who was born to me, seeks my life. With how much more reason now may this Benjamite do it? Let him alone; and let him curse, for the Lord has bidden him to do it."},{"num":12,"verse":"It may be that the Lord will look on the iniquity done me and will recompense me with good for his cursing this day."},{"num":13,"verse":"So David and his men went by the road, and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite David and cursed as he went and threw stones and dust at him."},{"num":14,"verse":"And the king and all the people who were with him came [to the Jordan] weary, and he refreshed himself there."},{"num":15,"verse":"And Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."},{"num":16,"verse":"And when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to [him], Long live the king!

What shall we do?"},{"num":21,"verse":"And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father’s concubines whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be made strong."},{"num":22,"verse":"So they spread for Absalom a tent on the top of the [king’s] house, and Absalom went in to his father’s harem in the sight of all Israel."},{"num":23,"verse":"And the counsel of Ahithophel in those days was as if a man had consulted the word of God; so was all Ahithophel’s counsel considered both by David and by Absalom."}]
