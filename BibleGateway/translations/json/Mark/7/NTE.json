Why do they eat their food with unwashed hands?’"},{"num":6,"verse":"‘Isaiah summed you up just right,’ Jesus replied. ‘Hypocrites, the lot of you! What he said was this:"},{"num":8,"verse":"‘You abandon God’s commands, and keep human tradition!"},{"num":9,"verse":"‘So,’ he went on, ‘you have a fine way of setting aside God’s command so as to maintain your tradition.
