[{"header":"The Story of the Farmer"},{"num":4,"verse":"Again Jesus began to teach by the Sea of Galilee. The crowd that gathered around him was very large. So he got into a boat.

In his teaching he said, "},{"num":3,"verse":"“Listen! A farmer went out to plant his seed. "},{"num":4,"verse":"He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate it up. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Some seed fell on rocky places, where there wasn’t much soil. The plants came up quickly, because the soil wasn’t deep. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When the sun came up, it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants. So the plants did not bear grain. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Still other seed fell on good soil. It grew up and produced a crop 30, 60, or even 100 times more than the farmer planted.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears should listen.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Later Jesus was alone. The 12 disciples asked him about the stories. So did the others around him. "},{"num":11,"verse":"He told them, “The secret of God’s kingdom has been given to you. But to outsiders everything is told using stories. "},{"num":12,"verse":"In that way,"},{"num":13,"verse":"Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this story?

"},{"num":19,"verse":"But then the worries of this life come to them. Wealth comes with its false promises. The people also long for other things. All of these are the kinds of things that crowd out the message. They keep it from producing fruit. "},{"num":20,"verse":"And what is seed scattered on good soil like? The people hear the message. They accept it. They produce a good crop 30, 60, or even 100 times more than the farmer planted.”"},{"header":"A Lamp on a Stand"},{"num":21,"verse":"Jesus said to them, “Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a large bowl or a bed?

A farmer scatters seed on the ground. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Night and day the seed comes up and grows. It happens whether the farmer sleeps or gets up. He doesn’t know how it happens.

So the farmer cuts it down, because the harvest is ready.”"},{"header":"The Story of the Mustard Seed"},{"num":30,"verse":"Again Jesus said, “What can we say God’s kingdom is like? What story can we use to explain it? "},{"num":31,"verse":"It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth. "},{"num":32,"verse":"But when you plant the seed, it grows. It becomes the largest of all garden plants. Its branches are so big that birds can rest in its shade.”"},{"num":33,"verse":"Using many stories like these, Jesus spoke the word to them.
