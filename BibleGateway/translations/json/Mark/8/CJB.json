[{"num":8,"verse":"It was during that time that another large crowd gathered, and they had nothing to eat.

"},{"num":3,"verse":"If I send them off to their homes hungry, they will collapse on the way; some of them have come a long distance.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"His talmidim said to him, “How can anyone find enough bread to satisfy these people in a remote place like this?” "},{"num":5,"verse":"“How many loaves do you have?” he asked them. They answered, “Seven.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"He then told the crowd to sit down on the ground, took the seven loaves, made a b’rakhah, broke the loaves and gave them to his talmidim to serve to the people. "},{"num":7,"verse":"They also had a few fish; making a b’rakhah over them he also ordered these to be served. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The people ate their fill; and the talmidim took up the leftover pieces, seven large basketsful. "},{"num":9,"verse":"About four thousand were there. "},{"num":10,"verse":"After sending them away, Yeshua got into the boat with his talmidim and went off to the district of Dalmanuta."},{"num":11,"verse":"The P’rushim came and began arguing with him; they wanted him to give them a sign from Heaven, because they were out to trap him. "},{"num":12,"verse":"With a sigh that came straight from his heart, he said, “Why does this generation want a sign? Yes! I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation!” "},{"num":13,"verse":"With that, he left them, got into the boat again and went off to the other side of the lake."},{"num":14,"verse":"Now the talmidim had forgotten to bring bread and had with them in the boat only one loaf. "},{"num":15,"verse":"So when Yeshua said to them, “Watch out! Guard yourselves from the hametz of the P’rushim and the hametz of Herod,” "},{"num":16,"verse":"they thought he had said it because they had no bread. "},{"num":17,"verse":"But, aware of this, he said, “Why are you talking with each other about having no bread? Don’t you see or understand yet? Have your hearts been made like stone? "},{"num":18,"verse":"You have eyes — don’t you see? You have ears — don’t you hear? And don’t you remember? "},{"num":19,"verse":"When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?” “Twelve,” they answered him. "},{"num":20,"verse":"“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you collect?” “Seven,” they answered. "},{"num":21,"verse":"He said to them, “And you still don’t understand?”"},{"num":22,"verse":"They came to Beit-Tzaidah. Some people brought him a blind man and begged Yeshua to touch him. "},{"num":23,"verse":"Taking the blind man’s hand, he led him outside the town. He spit in his eyes, put his hands on him and asked him, “Do you see anything?” "},{"num":24,"verse":"He looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like walking trees.” "},{"num":25,"verse":"Then he put his hands on the blind man’s eyes again. He peered intently, and his eyesight was restored, so that he could see everything distinctly. "},{"num":26,"verse":"Yeshua sent him home with the words, “Don’t go into town.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"Yeshua and his talmidim went on to the towns of Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked his talmidim, “Who are people saying I am?” "},{"num":28,"verse":"“Some say you are Yochanan the Immerser,” they told him, “others say Eliyahu, and still others, one of the prophets.” "},{"num":29,"verse":"“But you,” he asked, “who do you say I am?” Kefa answered, “You are the Mashiach.” "},{"num":30,"verse":"Then Yeshua warned them not to tell anyone about him. "},{"num":31,"verse":"He began teaching them that the Son of Man had to endure much suffering and be rejected by the elders, the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers; and that he had to be put to death; but that after three days, he had to rise again.
