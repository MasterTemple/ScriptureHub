Finally, he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ "},{"num":7,"verse":"But those tenant farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come on, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"They seized him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"They came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest and do not play favorites, since you are not partial to anyone, but you teach the way of God on the basis of the truth.

"},{"num":30,"verse":"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ "},{"num":31,"verse":"The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”"},{"num":32,"verse":"The expert in the law said to him, “Well said, teacher. You have spoken correctly on the basis of the truth that he is one, and there is no other besides him. "},{"num":33,"verse":"To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that, no one dared to ask him any more questions."},{"header":"David’s Son and David’s Lord"},{"num":35,"verse":"While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he responded by saying, “How is it that the experts in the law say that the Christ is the Son of David?
