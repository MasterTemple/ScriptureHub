"},{"num":3,"verse":"The tenants grabbed the slave, beat him, and sent him back without a thing. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the owner sent another slave; the tenants beat him over the head and treated him shamefully. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The owner sent another slave, and they killed him; and they treated many others the same way, beating some and killing others.

"},{"num":14,"verse":"They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you tell the truth, without worrying about what people think.

Should we pay them or not?”"},{"num":15,"verse":"But Jesus saw through their trick and answered, “Why are you trying to trap me? Bring a silver coin, and let me see it.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"They brought him one, and he asked, “Whose face and name are these?”"},{"num":17,"verse":"So Jesus said, “Well, then, pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and pay to God what belongs to God.”"},{"header":"The Question about Rising from Death(E)"},{"num":18,"verse":"Then some Sadducees, who say that people will not rise from death, came to Jesus and said, "},{"num":19,"verse":"“Teacher, Moses wrote this law for us: ‘If a man dies and leaves a wife but no children, that man's brother must marry the widow so that they can have children who will be considered the dead man's children.’ "},{"num":20,"verse":"Once there were seven brothers; the oldest got married and died without having children.

It is true, as you say, that only the Lord is God and that there is no other god but he. "},{"num":33,"verse":"And you must love God with all your heart and with all your mind and with all your strength; and you must love your neighbor as you love yourself. It is more important to obey these two commandments than to offer on the altar animals and other sacrifices to God.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"Jesus noticed how wise his answer was, and so he told him, “You are not far from the Kingdom of God.”"},{"header":"The Question about the Messiah(O)"},{"num":35,"verse":"As Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he asked the question, “How can the teachers of the Law say that the Messiah will be the descendant of David?
