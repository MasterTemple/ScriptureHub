All people will be like angels in heaven."},{"num":26,"verse":"Surely you have read what God said about people rising from death.

You are right in saying that God is the only Lord and that there is no other God."},{"num":33,"verse":"And you must love God with all your heart, all your mind, and all your strength. And you must love others the same as you love yourself.
