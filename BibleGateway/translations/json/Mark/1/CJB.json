[{"num":1,"verse":"The beginning of the Good News of Yeshua the Messiah, the Son of God:"},{"num":2,"verse":"It is written in the prophet Yesha‘yahu,"},{"num":4,"verse":"So it was that Yochanan the Immerser appeared in the desert, proclaiming an immersion involving turning to God from sin in order to be forgiven. "},{"num":5,"verse":"People went out to him from all over Y’hudah, as did all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. Confessing their sins, they were immersed by him in the Yarden River. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Yochanan wore clothes of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist; he ate locusts and wild honey. "},{"num":7,"verse":"He proclaimed: “After me is coming someone who is more powerful than I — I’m not worthy even to bend down and untie his sandals. "},{"num":8,"verse":"I have immersed you in water, but he will immerse you in the Ruach HaKodesh.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Shortly thereafter, Yeshua came from Natzeret in the Galil and was immersed in the Yarden by Yochanan. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Immediately upon coming up out of the water, he saw heaven torn open and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove; "},{"num":11,"verse":"then a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, whom I love; I am well pleased with you.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness, "},{"num":13,"verse":"and he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by the Adversary. He was with the wild animals, and the angels took care of him."},{"num":14,"verse":"After Yochanan had been arrested, Yeshua came into the Galil proclaiming the Good News from God:"},{"num":16,"verse":"As he walked beside Lake Kinneret, he saw Shim‘on and Andrew, Shim‘on’s brother, casting a net into the lake; for they were fishermen. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Yeshua said to them, “Come, follow me, and I will make you into fishers for men!” "},{"num":18,"verse":"At once they left their nets and followed him."},{"num":19,"verse":"Going on a little farther, he saw Ya‘akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan, his brother, in their boat, repairing their nets. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zavdai in the boat with the hired men and went after Yeshua."},{"num":21,"verse":"They entered K’far-Nachum, and on Shabbat Yeshua went into the synagogue and began teaching. "},{"num":22,"verse":"They were amazed at the way he taught, for he did not instruct them like the Torah-teachers but as one who had authority himself."},{"num":23,"verse":"In their synagogue just then was a man with an unclean spirit in him, who shouted, "},{"num":24,"verse":"“What do you want with us, Yeshua from Natzeret? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God!” "},{"num":25,"verse":"But Yeshua rebuked the unclean spirit, “Be quiet and come out of him!” "},{"num":26,"verse":"Throwing the man into a convulsion, it gave a loud shriek and came out of him. "},{"num":27,"verse":"They were all so astounded that they began asking each other, “What is this? A new teaching, one with authority behind it! He gives orders even to the unclean spirits, and they obey him!” "},{"num":28,"verse":"And the news about him spread quickly through the whole region of the Galil."},{"num":29,"verse":"They left the synagogue and went with Ya‘akov and Yochanan to the home of Shim‘on and Andrew. "},{"num":30,"verse":"Shim‘on’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever, and they told Yeshua about her. "},{"num":31,"verse":"He came, took her by the hand and lifted her onto her feet. The fever left her, and she began helping them."},{"num":32,"verse":"That evening after sundown, they brought to Yeshua all who were ill or held in the power of demons, "},{"num":33,"verse":"and the whole town came crowding around the door. "},{"num":34,"verse":"He healed many who were ill with various diseases and expelled many demons, but he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was."},{"num":35,"verse":"Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Yeshua got up, left, went away to a lonely spot and stayed there praying. "},{"num":36,"verse":"But Shim‘on and those with him went after him; "},{"num":37,"verse":"and when they found him, they said, “Everybody is looking for you.” "},{"num":38,"verse":"He answered, “Let’s go somewhere else — to the other villages around here. I have to proclaim the message there too — in fact this is why I came out.” "},{"num":39,"verse":"So he traveled all through the Galil, preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons."},{"num":40,"verse":"A man afflicted with tzara‘at came to Yeshua and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.” "},{"num":41,"verse":"Moved with pity, Yeshua reached out his hand, touched him and said to him, “I am willing! Be cleansed!” "},{"num":42,"verse":"Instantly the tzara‘at left him, and he was cleansed. "},{"num":43,"verse":"Yeshua sent him away with this stern warning: "},{"num":44,"verse":"“See to it that you tell no one; instead, as a testimony to the people, go and let the cohen examine you, and offer for your cleansing what Moshe commanded.” "},{"num":45,"verse":"But he went out and began spreading the news, talking freely about it; so that Yeshua could no longer enter a town openly but stayed out in the country, where people continued coming to him from all around."}]
