[{"num":14,"verse":"It was now two days before Pesach (that is, the festival of Matzah), and the head cohanim and the Torah-teachers were trying to find some way to arrest Yeshua surreptitiously and have him put to death; "},{"num":2,"verse":"for they said, “Not during the festival, or the people will riot.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"While he was in Beit-Anyah in the home of Shim‘on (a man who had had tzara‘at), and as he was eating, a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfume, pure oil of nard, very costly. She broke the jar and poured the perfume over Yeshua’s head. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But some there angrily said to themselves, “Why this waste of perfume? "},{"num":5,"verse":"It could have been sold for a year’s wages and given to the poor!” And they scolded her. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But he said, “Let her be. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For you will always have the poor with you; and whenever you want to, you can help them. But you will not always have me. "},{"num":8,"verse":"What she could do, she did do — in advance she poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Yes! I tell you that wherever in the whole world this Good News is proclaimed, what she has done will be told in her memory.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Then Y’hudah from K’riot, who was one of the Twelve, went to the head cohanim in order to betray Yeshua to them. "},{"num":11,"verse":"They were pleased to hear this and promised to give him money. And he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Yeshua."},{"num":12,"verse":"On the first day for matzah, when they slaughtered the lamb for Pesach, Yeshua’s talmidim asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare your Seder?” "},{"num":13,"verse":"He sent two of his talmidim with these instructions: “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him; "},{"num":14,"verse":"and whichever house he enters, tell him that the Rabbi says, ‘Where is the guest room for me, where I am to eat the Pesach meal with my talmidim?’ "},{"num":15,"verse":"He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make the preparations there.” "},{"num":16,"verse":"The talmidim went off, came to the city and found things just as he had told them they would be; and they prepared the Seder."},{"num":17,"verse":"When evening came, Yeshua arrived with the Twelve. "},{"num":18,"verse":"As they were reclining and eating, Yeshua said, “Yes! I tell you that one of you is going to betray me.” "},{"num":19,"verse":"They became upset and began asking him, one after the other, “You don’t mean me, do you?” "},{"num":20,"verse":"“It’s one of the Twelve,” he said to them, “someone dipping matzah in the dish with me. "},{"num":21,"verse":"For the Son of Man will die, just as the Tanakh says he will; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him had he never been born!”"},{"num":22,"verse":"While they were eating, Yeshua took a piece of matzah, made the b’rakhah, broke it, gave it to them and said, “Take it! This is my body.” "},{"num":23,"verse":"Also he took a cup of wine, made the b’rakhah, and gave it to them; and they all drank. "},{"num":24,"verse":"He said to them, “This is my blood, which ratifies the New Covenant, my blood shed on behalf of many people. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Yes! I tell you, I will not drink this ‘fruit of the vine’ again until the day I drink new wine in the Kingdom of God.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"After singing the Hallel, they went out to the Mount of Olives. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Yeshua said to them, “You will all lose faith in me, for the Tanakh says,"},{"num":28,"verse":"But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you into the Galil.” "},{"num":29,"verse":"Kefa said to him, “Even if everyone else loses faith in you, I won’t.” "},{"num":30,"verse":"Yeshua replied, “Yes! I tell you that this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times!” "},{"num":31,"verse":"But Kefa kept insisting, “Even if I must die with you, I will never disown you!” And they all said the same thing."},{"num":32,"verse":"They went to a place called Gat Sh’manim; and Yeshua said to his talmidim, “Sit here while I pray.” "},{"num":33,"verse":"He took with him Kefa, Ya‘akov and Yochanan. Great distress and anguish came over him; "},{"num":34,"verse":"and he said to them, “My heart is so filled with sadness that I could die! Remain here and stay awake.” "},{"num":35,"verse":"Going on a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that if possible, the hour might pass from him: "},{"num":36,"verse":"“Abba!” (that is, “Dear Father!”) “All things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me! Still, not what I want, but what you want.” "},{"num":37,"verse":"He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Kefa, “Shim‘on, are you asleep? Couldn’t you stay awake one hour? "},{"num":38,"verse":"Stay awake, and pray that you will not be put to the test — the spirit indeed is eager, but human nature is weak.”"},{"num":39,"verse":"Again he went away and prayed, saying the same words; "},{"num":40,"verse":"and again he came and found them sleeping, their eyes were so very heavy; and they didn’t know what to answer him."},{"num":41,"verse":"The third time, he came and said to them, “For now, go on sleeping, take your rest. . . .There, that’s enough! The time has come! Look! The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners! "},{"num":42,"verse":"Get up! Let’s go! Here comes my betrayer!”"},{"num":43,"verse":"While Yeshua was still speaking, Y’hudah (one of the Twelve!) came, and with him a crowd carrying swords and clubs, from the head cohanim, the Torah-teachers and the elders. "},{"num":44,"verse":"The betrayer had arranged to give them a signal: “The man I kiss is the one you want. Grab him, and take him away under guard.” "},{"num":45,"verse":"As he arrived, he went right up to Yeshua, said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him. "},{"num":46,"verse":"Then they laid hold of Yeshua and arrested him; "},{"num":47,"verse":"but one of the people standing nearby drew his sword and struck at the servant of the cohen hagadol, cutting off his ear."},{"num":48,"verse":"Yeshua addressed them: “So you came out to take me with swords and clubs, the way you would the leader of a rebellion? "},{"num":49,"verse":"Every day I was with you in the Temple court, teaching, and you didn’t seize me then! But let the Tanakh be fulfilled.” "},{"num":50,"verse":"And they all deserted him and ran away. "},{"num":51,"verse":"There was one young man who did try to follow him; but he was wearing only a nightshirt; and when they tried to seize him, "},{"num":52,"verse":"he slipped out of the nightshirt and ran away naked."},{"num":53,"verse":"They led Yeshua to the cohen hagadol, with whom all the head cohanim, elders and Torah-teachers were assembling. "},{"num":54,"verse":"Kefa followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the cohen hagadol, where he sat down with the guards and warmed himself by the fire."},{"num":55,"verse":"The head cohanim and the whole Sanhedrin tried to find evidence against Yeshua, so that they might have him put to death, but they couldn’t find any. "},{"num":56,"verse":"For many people gave false evidence against him, but their testimonies didn’t agree. "},{"num":57,"verse":"Some stood up and gave this false testimony: "},{"num":58,"verse":"“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this Temple made with hands; and in three days I will build another one, not made with hands.’” "},{"num":59,"verse":"Even so, their testimonies didn’t agree."},{"num":60,"verse":"The cohen hagadol stood up in the front and asked Yeshua, “Have you nothing to say to the accusations these men are making?” "},{"num":61,"verse":"But he remained silent and made no reply. Again the cohen hagadol questioned him: “Are you the Mashiach, Ben-HaM’vorakh?” "},{"num":62,"verse":"“I AM,” answered Yeshua. “Moreover, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of HaG’vurah and coming on the clouds of heaven.” "},{"num":63,"verse":"At this, the cohen hagadol tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses? "},{"num":64,"verse":"You heard him blaspheme! What is your decision?” And they all declared him guilty and subject to the death penalty."},{"num":65,"verse":"Then some began spitting at him; and after blindfolding him, they started pounding him with their fists and saying to him, “Let’s see you prophesy!” And as the guards took him, they beat him too."},{"num":66,"verse":"Meanwhile, Kefa was still in the courtyard below. One of the serving-girls of the cohen hagadol "},{"num":67,"verse":"saw Kefa warming himself, took a look at him, and said, “You were with the man from Natzeret, Yeshua!” "},{"num":68,"verse":"But he denied it, saying, “I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re talking about!” He went outside into the entryway, and a rooster crowed. "},{"num":69,"verse":"The girl saw him there and started telling the bystanders, “This fellow is one of them.” "},{"num":70,"verse":"Again he denied it. A little later, the bystanders themselves said to Kefa, “You must be one of them, because you’re from the Galil.” "},{"num":71,"verse":"At this he began to invoke a curse on himself as he swore, “I do not know this man you are telling me about!” — "},{"num":72,"verse":"and immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Kefa remembered what Yeshua had said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times.” And throwing himself down, he burst into tears."}]
