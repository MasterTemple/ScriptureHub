"},{"num":5,"verse":"It could have been sold for more than 300 silver coins and the money given to the poor!” So they spoke angrily to her. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a good service for me. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For you will always have the poor with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want.

"},{"num":60,"verse":"Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?” "},{"num":61,"verse":"But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest questioned him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” "},{"num":62,"verse":"“I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.” "},{"num":63,"verse":"Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses?
