[{"num":9,"verse":"Then he drove it home by saying, “This isn’t pie in the sky by and by. Some of you who are standing here are going to see it happen, see the kingdom of God arrive in full force.”"},{"header":"In a Light-Radiant Cloud"},{"num":2,"verse":"Six days later, three of them did see it. Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain. His appearance changed from the inside out, right before their eyes. His clothes shimmered, glistening white, whiter than any bleach could make them. Elijah, along with Moses, came into view, in deep conversation with Jesus."},{"num":5,"verse":"Peter interrupted, “Rabbi, this is a great moment! Let’s build three memorials—one for you, one for Moses, one for Elijah.” He blurted this out without thinking, stunned as they all were by what they were seeing."},{"num":7,"verse":"Just then a light-radiant cloud enveloped them, and from deep in the cloud, a voice: “This is my Son, marked by my love. Listen to him.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"The next minute the disciples were looking around, rubbing their eyes, seeing nothing but Jesus, only Jesus."},{"num":9,"verse":"Coming down the mountain, Jesus swore them to secrecy. “Don’t tell a soul what you saw. After the Son of Man rises from the dead, you’re free to talk.” They puzzled over that, wondering what on earth “rising from the dead” meant."},{"num":11,"verse":"Meanwhile they were asking, “Why do the religion scholars say that Elijah has to come first?”"},{"num":12,"verse":"Jesus replied, “Elijah does come first and get everything ready for the coming of the Son of Man.

What’s all the commotion?”"},{"num":17,"verse":"A man out of the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought my mute son, made speechless by a demon, to you. Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and goes stiff as a board. I told your disciples, hoping they could deliver him, but they couldn’t.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"Jesus said, “What a generation! No sense of God! How many times do I have to go over these things? How much longer do I have to put up with this? Bring the boy here.” They brought him.

The boy stood up."},{"num":28,"verse":"After arriving back home, his disciples cornered Jesus and asked, “Why couldn’t we throw the demon out?”"},{"num":29,"verse":"He answered, “There is no way to get rid of this kind of demon except by prayer.”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Leaving there, they went through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know their whereabouts, for he wanted to teach his disciples. He told them, “The Son of Man is about to be betrayed to some people who want nothing to do with God.

No one can use my name to do something good and powerful, and in the next breath slam me. If he’s not an enemy, he’s an ally. Why, anyone by just giving you a cup of water in my name is on our side. Count on it that God will notice."},{"num":42,"verse":"“On the other hand, if you give one of these simple, childlike believers a hard time, bullying or taking advantage of their simple trust, you’ll soon wish you hadn’t. You’d be better off dropped in the middle of the lake with a millstone around your neck."},{"num":43,"verse":"“If your hand or your foot gets in God’s way, chop it off and throw it away. You’re better off maimed or lame and alive than the proud owner of two hands and two feet, godless in a furnace of eternal fire. And if your eye distracts you from God, pull it out and throw it away. You’re better off one-eyed and alive than exercising your twenty-twenty vision from inside the fire of hell."},{"num":49,"verse":"“Everyone’s going through a refining fire sooner or later, but you’ll be well-preserved, protected from the eternal flames. Be preservatives yourselves. Preserve the peace.”"}]
