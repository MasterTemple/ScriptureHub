Yes, please be patient with me."},{"num":2,"verse":"You need to know that God’s passion is burning inside me for you, because, like a loving father, I have pledged your hand in marriage to Christ, your true bridegroom. I’ve also promised that I would present his fiancée to him as a pure virgin bride. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But now I’m afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s clever lies, your thoughts may be corrupted and you may lose your single-hearted devotion and pure love for Christ. "},{"num":4,"verse":"For you seem to gladly tolerate anyone who comes to you preaching a pseudo-Jesus, not the Jesus we have preached. You have accepted a spirit and gospel that is false, rather than the Spirit and gospel you once embraced. How tolerant you have become of these imposters!"},{"header":"Super-Apostles?"},{"num":5,"verse":"Now, I believe that I am not inferior in any way to these special “super-apostles” you are attracted to. "},{"num":6,"verse":"For although I may not be a polished or eloquent speaker, I’m certainly not an amateur in revelation knowledge.

"},{"num":11,"verse":"Why? Is it because I have no love for you? God knows how much I love you! "},{"num":12,"verse":"But in order to eliminate the opportunity for those “super-apostles” to boast that their ministry is on the same level as ours I will continue this practice. "},{"num":13,"verse":"For they are not true apostles but deceitful ministers who masquerade as “special apostles” of the Anointed One. "},{"num":14,"verse":"That doesn’t surprise us, for even Satan transforms himself to appear as an angel of light! "},{"num":15,"verse":"So it’s no wonder his servants also go about pretending to be ministers of righteousness. But in the end they will be exposed and get exactly what they deserve."},{"header":"Paul Speaks as a “Fool”"},{"num":16,"verse":"So I repeat. Let no one think that I’m a fool.

So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? Me too! "},{"num":23,"verse":"Are they servants of the Anointed One? I’m beside myself when I speak this way, but I am much more of a servant than they. I have worked much harder for God, taken more beatings, and been dragged to more prisons than they.

"},{"num":25,"verse":"Three times I experienced being beaten with rods. Once they stoned me. Three times I’ve been shipwrecked; for an entire night and a day I was adrift in the open sea. "},{"num":26,"verse":"In my difficult travels I’ve faced many dangerous situations: perilous rivers, robbers, foreigners, and even my own people. I’ve survived deadly peril in the city, in the wilderness, with storms at sea, and with spies posing as believers.

I’ve frequently been deprived of food and water, left hungry and shivering out in the cold, lacking proper clothing."},{"num":28,"verse":"And besides these painful circumstances, I have the daily pressure of my responsibility for all the churches, with a deep concern weighing heavily on my heart for their welfare.
