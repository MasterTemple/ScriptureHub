I wanted to be able to give you to him as if you were a pure virgin. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But Eve’s mind was tricked by the snake’s clever lies. And here’s what I’m afraid of. Your minds will also somehow be led astray. They will be led away from your true and pure love for Christ.

Or suppose you receive a different message of good news. Suppose it was different from the one you accepted earlier. You put up with those kinds of things easily enough."},{"num":5,"verse":"I don’t think I’m in any way less important than those “super-apostles.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"It’s true that I haven’t been trained as a speaker.

Because I don’t love you? No! God knows I do!"},{"num":12,"verse":"And I will keep on doing what I’m doing. That will stop those who claim they have things to brag about. They think they have a chance to be considered equal with us. "},{"num":13,"verse":"People like that are false apostles. They are workers who tell lies. They only pretend to be apostles of Christ.
