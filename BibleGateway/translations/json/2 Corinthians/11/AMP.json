"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But I am afraid that, even as the serpent beguiled Eve by his cunning, your minds may be corrupted  led away from the simplicity of [your sincere and] pure devotion to Christ. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For [you seem willing to allow it] if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted. You tolerate all this beautifully [welcoming the deception]. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Yet I consider myself in no way inferior to the [so-called] super-apostles.

God knows [that I do]!"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But what I am doing I will keep doing, [for I am determined to keep this independence] in order to cut off the claim of those who want an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things they brag about.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And no wonder, since Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.
