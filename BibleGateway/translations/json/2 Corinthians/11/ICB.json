"},{"num":2,"verse":"I am jealous over you. And this jealousy comes from God. I promised to give you to Christ. He must be your only husband. I want to give you to Christ to be his pure bride. "},{"num":3,"verse":"But I am afraid that your minds will be led away from your true and pure following of Christ. This might happen just as Eve was tricked by the snake with his evil ways. "},{"num":4,"verse":"You are very patient with anyone who comes to you and preaches a different Jesus than the one we preached. You are very willing to accept a spirit or Good News that is different from the Spirit and Good News that you received from us."},{"num":5,"verse":"I do not think that those “great apostles” are any better than I am.

I say this with the truth of Christ in me. "},{"num":11,"verse":"And why do I not depend on you? Do you think it is because I do not love you? No. God knows that I love you."},{"num":12,"verse":"And I will keep on doing what I am doing now. I will continue because I want to stop those people from having a reason to brag.

And they change themselves to look like apostles of Christ. "},{"num":14,"verse":"This does not surprise us. Even Satan changes himself to look like an angel of light.
