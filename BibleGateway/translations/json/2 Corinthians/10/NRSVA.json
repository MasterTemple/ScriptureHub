[{"header":"Paul Defends His Ministry"},{"num":10,"verse":"I myself, Paul, appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ—I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold towards you when I am away!— "},{"num":2,"verse":"I ask that when I am present I need not show boldness by daring to oppose those who think we are acting according to human standards. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Indeed, we live as human beings, but we do not wage war according to human standards; "},{"num":4,"verse":"for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human, but they have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments "},{"num":5,"verse":"and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive to obey Christ. "},{"num":6,"verse":"We are ready to punish every disobedience when your obedience is complete."},{"num":7,"verse":"Look at what is before your eyes. If you are confident that you belong to Christ, remind yourself of this, that just as you belong to Christ, so also do we.
