He is our merciful Father and the God of all comfort, "},{"num":4,"verse":"who comforts us in all our suffering, so that we may be able to comfort others in all their suffering, as we ourselves are being comforted by God. "},{"num":5,"verse":"For as the Messiah’s sufferings overflow into us, so also our comfort overflows through the Messiah. "},{"num":6,"verse":"If we suffer, it is for your comfort and salvation.

I hope you will understand completely, "},{"num":14,"verse":"just as you have already understood us partially, so that on the Day of our Lord Jesus we can be your reason to boast, even as you are ours."},{"header":"Why Paul’s Visit Was Postponed"},{"num":15,"verse":"Because I was confident, I planned to come to you first so you might receive a double blessing.
