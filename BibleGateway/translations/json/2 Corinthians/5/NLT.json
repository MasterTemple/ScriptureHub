Rather, we want to put on our new bodies so that these dying bodies will be swallowed up by life."},{"num":5,"verse":"God himself has prepared us for this, and as a guarantee he has given us his Holy Spirit."},{"num":6,"verse":"So we are always confident, even though we know that as long as we live in these bodies we are not at home with the Lord."},{"num":7,"verse":"For we live by believing and not by seeing."},{"num":8,"verse":"Yes, we are fully confident, and we would rather be away from these earthly bodies, for then we will be at home with the Lord."},{"num":9,"verse":"So whether we are here in this body or away from this body, our goal is to please him."},{"num":10,"verse":"For we must all stand before Christ to be judged.
