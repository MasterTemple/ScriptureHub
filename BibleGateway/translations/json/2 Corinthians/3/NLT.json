[{"num":3,"verse":"Are we beginning to praise ourselves again? Are we like others, who need to bring you letters of recommendation, or who ask you to write such letters on their behalf? Surely not!"},{"num":2,"verse":"The only letter of recommendation we need is you yourselves. Your lives are a letter written in our hearts; everyone can read it and recognize our good work among you."},{"num":3,"verse":"Clearly, you are a letter from Christ showing the result of our ministry among you. This “letter” is written not with pen and ink, but with the Spirit of the living God. It is carved not on tablets of stone, but on human hearts."},{"num":4,"verse":"We are confident of all this because of our great trust in God through Christ."},{"num":5,"verse":"It is not that we think we are qualified to do anything on our own. Our qualification comes from God."},{"num":6,"verse":"He has enabled us to be ministers of his new covenant. This is a covenant not of written laws, but of the Spirit. The old written covenant ends in death; but under the new covenant, the Spirit gives life."},{"header":"The Glory of the New Covenant"},{"num":7,"verse":"The old way, with laws etched in stone, led to death, though it began with such glory that the people of Israel could not bear to look at Moses’ face.
