Or perhaps even to get from you? "},{"num":2,"verse":"You are our official reference! It’s written on our hearts! Everybody can know it and read it! "},{"num":3,"verse":"It’s quite plain that you are a letter from the Messiah, with us as the messengers – a letter not written with ink but with the spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on the tablets of beating hearts."},{"num":4,"verse":"That’s the kind of confidence we have towards God, through the Messiah. "},{"num":5,"verse":"It isn’t as though we are qualified in ourselves to reckon that we have anything to offer on our own account. Our qualification comes from God: "},{"num":6,"verse":"God has qualified us to be stewards of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit. The letter kills, you see, but the spirit gives life."},{"header":"Death and Glory"},{"num":7,"verse":"But just think about it: when death was being distributed, carved in letters of stone, it was a glorious thing, so glorious in fact that the children of Israel couldn’t look at Moses’s face because of the glory of his face – a glory that was to be abolished.
