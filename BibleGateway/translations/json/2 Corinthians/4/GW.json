[{"header":"Paul Is Never Discouraged"},{"num":4,"verse":"We don’t become discouraged, since God has given us this ministry through his mercy. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Instead, we have refused to use secret and shameful ways. We don’t use tricks, and we don’t distort God’s word. As God watches, we clearly reveal the truth to everyone. This is our ⌞letter of⌟ recommendation."},{"num":3,"verse":"So if the Good News that we tell others is covered with a veil, it is hidden from those who are dying. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The god of this world has blinded the minds of those who don’t believe. As a result, they don’t see the light of the Good News about Christ’s glory. It is Christ who is God’s image."},{"num":5,"verse":"Our message is not about ourselves. It is about Jesus Christ as the Lord. We are your servants for his sake. "},{"num":6,"verse":"We are his servants because the same God who said that light should shine out of darkness has given us light. For that reason we bring to light the knowledge about God’s glory which shines from Christ’s face."},{"num":7,"verse":"Our bodies are made of clay, yet we have the treasure of the Good News in them. This shows that the superior power of this treasure belongs to God and doesn’t come from us. "},{"num":8,"verse":"In every way we’re troubled, but we aren’t crushed by our troubles.

He will present us to God together with you."},{"num":15,"verse":"All this is for your sake so that, as God’s kindness  overflows in the lives of many people, it will produce even more thanksgiving to the glory of God. "},{"num":16,"verse":"That is why we are not discouraged. Though outwardly we are wearing out, inwardly we are renewed day by day.
