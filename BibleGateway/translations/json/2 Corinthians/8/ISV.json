"},{"num":2,"verse":"In spite of their terrible ordeal of suffering, their abundant joy and deep poverty have led them to be abundantly generous. "},{"num":3,"verse":"I can testify that by their own free will they have given to the utmost of their ability, yes, even beyond their ability. "},{"num":4,"verse":"They begged us earnestly for the privilege of participating in this ministry to the saints. "},{"num":5,"verse":"We did not expect that! They gave themselves to the Lord first and then to us, since this was God’s will. "},{"num":6,"verse":"So we urged Titus to finish this work of kindness among you in the same way that he had started it.

"},{"num":9,"verse":"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
