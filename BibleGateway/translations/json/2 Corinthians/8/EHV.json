"},{"num":3,"verse":"I testify that of their own free will they gave according to their ability, and even beyond their ability, "},{"num":4,"verse":"pleading with us with an urgent request for the gracious privilege of joining in this service to the saints. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And they did this not as we had expected, but in keeping with God’s will they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us. "},{"num":6,"verse":"As a result we urged Titus, since he had already made a beginning, to bring to completion this gracious gift on your part. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But just as you overflow in every way—in faith, in word, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us—see that you also overflow in this gracious gift."},{"num":8,"verse":"I do not say this as a command, but to test how genuine your love is, by comparing it with the eagerness of others. "},{"num":9,"verse":"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich."},{"num":10,"verse":"And I am giving advice in this matter because it is going to be helpful for you.
