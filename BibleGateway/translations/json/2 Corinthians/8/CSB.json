"},{"num":3,"verse":"I can testify that, according to their ability and even beyond their ability, of their own accord, "},{"num":4,"verse":"they begged us earnestly for the privilege of sharing in the ministry to the saints, "},{"num":5,"verse":"and not just as we had hoped. Instead, they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us by God’s will. "},{"num":6,"verse":"So we urged Titus that just as he had begun, so he should also complete among you this act of grace."},{"num":7,"verse":"Now as you excel in everything—in faith, speech, knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love for us—excel also in this act of grace. "},{"num":8,"verse":"I am not saying this as a command. Rather, by means of the diligence of others, I am testing the genuineness of your love. "},{"num":9,"verse":"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: Though he was rich, for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich. "},{"num":10,"verse":"And in this matter I am giving advice because it is profitable for you, who began last year not only to do something but also to want to do it. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Now also finish the task, so that just as there was an eager desire, there may also be a completion, according to what you have. "},{"num":12,"verse":"For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. "},{"num":13,"verse":"It is not that there should be relief for others and hardship for you, but it is a question of equality.
