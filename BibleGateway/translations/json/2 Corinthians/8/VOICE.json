"},{"num":4,"verse":"They came to us on their own, begging to take part in this work of grace to support the poor saints in Judea. "},{"num":5,"verse":"We were so overwhelmed—none of us expected their reaction—that they truly turned their lives over to the Lord and then gave themselves to support us in our work as we answer the call of God.
