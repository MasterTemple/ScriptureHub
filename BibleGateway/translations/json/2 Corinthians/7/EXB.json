[{"num":7,"verse":"[Therefore] ·Dear friends [Beloved], we have these promises from God, so we should make ourselves pure—free from ·anything that makes body or soul unclean [every defilement of flesh and spirit]. ·We should try to become holy in the way we live [or …and in this way bring our holiness to completion/perfection], ·because we respect [out of reverence for; in the fear of] God."},{"header":"Paul’s Joy"},{"num":2,"verse":"·Open your hearts to [Make room for] us.
