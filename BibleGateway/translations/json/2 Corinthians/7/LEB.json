"},{"num":2,"verse":"Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have ruined no one, we have defrauded no one. "},{"num":3,"verse":"I do not say this to condemn you, because I have already said that you are in our hearts, so that we die together and we live together. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Great is my confidence toward you; great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with encouragement; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction."},{"num":5,"verse":"For even when we arrived in Macedonia, our body had no rest, but we were afflicted in every way—quarrels outside, fears within. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But God, who comforts the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus, "},{"num":7,"verse":"and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted among you, because he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.

Even if I did regret it (I see that that letter grieved you, even though for a short time), "},{"num":9,"verse":"now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to repentance. For you were grieved according to the will of God, so that you suffered loss in no way through us.

In everything you have demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
