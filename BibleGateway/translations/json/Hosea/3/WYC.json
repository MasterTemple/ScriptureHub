[{"num":3,"verse":"And the Lord said to me, Yet go thou, and love a woman loved of a friend, and a woman adulteress, as the Lord loveth the sons of Israel; and they behold to alien gods, and love the dregs of grapes. (And the Lord said to me, Now go thou, and love a woman loved by a friend, yea, a woman who is an adulteress, like the Lord loveth the Israelites; even though they turn to strange, or foreign, gods, and love the dregs, or the lees, of grapes.)"},{"num":2,"verse":"And I delved it to me by fifteen pence, and by a cor of barley, and by half a cor of barley.
