[{"num":3,"verse":"Not many [of you] should become teachers (self-constituted censors and reprovers of others), my brethren, for you know that we [teachers] will be judged by a higher standard and with greater severity [than other people; thus we assume the greater accountability and the more condemnation]."},{"num":2,"verse":"For we all often stumble and fall and offend in many things.

See how much wood or how great a forest a tiny spark can set ablaze!"},{"num":6,"verse":"And the tongue is a fire. [The tongue is a] world of wickedness set among our members, contaminating and depraving the whole body and setting on fire the wheel of birth (the cycle of man’s nature), being itself ignited by hell (Gehenna)."},{"num":7,"verse":"For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea animal, can be tamed and has been tamed by human genius (nature)."},{"num":8,"verse":"But the human tongue can be tamed by no man. It is a restless (undisciplined, irreconcilable) evil, full of deadly poison."},{"num":9,"verse":"With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who were made in God’s likeness!"},{"num":10,"verse":"Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing.
