My brethren, since you are believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, you must never practice favoritism."},{"num":2,"verse":"Suppose a man wearing a gold ring and expensive clothes comes into your assembly as well as a poor man dressed in shabby clothes."},{"num":3,"verse":"If you lavish special attention on the one wearing the expensive clothes and say, “Please sit in this good seat,” while to the poor man you say, “Stand over there,” or “Sit on the floor at my feet,”"},{"num":4,"verse":"have you not shown favoritism among yourselves and judged by wrongful standards?"},{"num":5,"verse":"Listen to me, my beloved brethren.
