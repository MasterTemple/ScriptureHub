"},{"num":3,"verse":"If you show special attention to the rich man in expensive clothes and say, “Here’s a seat of honor for you right up front!” but you turn and say to the poor beggar dressed in rags, “You can stand over here,” or “Sit over there on the floor in the back,” "},{"num":4,"verse":"then you’ve demonstrated gross prejudice among yourselves and used evil standards of judgment!"},{"num":5,"verse":"So listen carefully, my dear brothers and sisters, hasn’t God chosen the poor in the world’s eyes to be those who are rich in faith?
