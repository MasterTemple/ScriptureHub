Have a seat up here!’ but then you turn to the poor person and say, ‘Stand there!’ or, ‘Get down there by my footstool!’ "},{"num":4,"verse":"When you do this, are you not discriminating among yourselves? Are you not turning into judges with evil thoughts? "},{"num":5,"verse":"Listen, my dear brothers and sisters. Isn’t it the case that God has chosen the poor (as the world sees it) to be rich in faith, and to inherit the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him? "},{"num":6,"verse":"But you have dishonoured the poor man. After all, who are the rich? The rich are the ones who lord it over you and drag you into court, aren’t they?
