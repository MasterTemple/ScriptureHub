"},{"num":2,"verse":"Suppose someone comes into your church meeting wearing nice clothes and a gold ring. At the same time a poor person comes in wearing old, dirty clothes. "},{"num":3,"verse":"You show special attention to the one wearing nice clothes and say, “Please, sit here in this good seat.” But you say to the poor person, “Stand over there,” or, “Sit on the floor by my feet.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"What are you doing? You are making some people more important than others, and with evil thoughts you are deciding that one person is better."},{"num":5,"verse":"Listen, my dear brothers and sisters! God chose the poor in the world to be rich with faith and to receive the kingdom God promised to those who love him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But you show no respect to the poor.
