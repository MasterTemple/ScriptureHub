At the right time, he’ll know God’s sweet approval and will be crowned with life. As God has promised, the crown awaits all who love Him."},{"num":13,"verse":"No one who is tempted should ever be confused and say that God is testing him. The One who created us is free from evil and can’t be tempted, so He doesn’t tempt anyone.
