Greetings!"}],[{"type":"header","content":"Joy in Trials"},{"type":"prose","content":"My brothers and sisters, consider it nothing but joy when you fall into all sorts of trials, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you will be perfect and complete, not deficient in anything. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But if anyone is deficient in wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without reprimand, and it will be given to him. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"since he is a double-minded individual, unstable in all his ways."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Now the believer of humble means should take pride in his high position.

So also the rich person in the midst of his pursuits will wither away.
