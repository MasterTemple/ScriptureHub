"},{"num":4,"verse":"And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you will be perfect and complete, not deficient in anything. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But if anyone is deficient in wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without reprimand, and it will be given to him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind. "},{"num":7,"verse":"For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord, "},{"num":8,"verse":"since he is a double-minded individual, unstable in all his ways."},{"num":9,"verse":"Now the believer of humble means should take pride in his high position. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But the rich person’s pride should be in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a wildflower in the meadow.
