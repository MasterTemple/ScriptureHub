If someone among you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without finding fault, and it will be given to him."},{"num":6,"verse":"But he is to ask with faith, without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed about by the wind."},{"num":7,"verse":"A man like that should not think that he will receive anything from the Lord,"},{"num":8,"verse":"since he is of two minds and inconsistent in everything he does."},{"num":9,"verse":"Rich and Poor.
