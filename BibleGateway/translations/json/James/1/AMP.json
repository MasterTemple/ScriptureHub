"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Be assured that the testing of your faith [through experience] produces endurance [leading to spiritual maturity, and inner peace]. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And let endurance have its perfect result  do a thorough work, so that you may be perfect and completely developed [in your faith], lacking in nothing."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"If any of you lacks wisdom [to guide him through a decision or circumstance], he is to ask of [our benevolent] God, who gives to everyone generously and without rebuke  blame, and it will be given to him. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But he must ask [for wisdom] in faith, without doubting [God’s willingness to help], for the one who doubts is like a billowing surge of the sea that is blown about and tossed by the wind. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"For such a person ought not to think  expect that he will receive anything [at all] from the Lord, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":" a double-minded man, unstable  restless in all his ways [in everything he thinks, feels, or decides]."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position [as a born-again believer, called to the true riches and to be an heir of God]; "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"and the rich man  in being humbled [by trials revealing human frailty, knowing true riches are found in the grace of God], for like the flower of the grass he will pass away.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God” [for temptation does not originate from God, but from our own flaws]; for God cannot be tempted by [what is] evil, and He Himself tempts no one. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But each one is tempted when he is dragged away, enticed  baited [to commit sin] by his own [worldly] desire (lust, passion).

Let everyone be quick to hear [be a careful, thoughtful listener], slow to speak [a speaker of carefully chosen words and], slow to anger [patient, reflective, forgiving]; "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"for the [resentful, deep-seated] anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God [that standard of behavior which He requires from us].
