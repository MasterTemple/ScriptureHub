"},{"num":4,"verse":"What’s more, you must let patience have its complete effect, so that you may be complete and whole, not falling short in anything."},{"num":5,"verse":"If any one of you falls short in wisdom, they should ask God for it, and it will be given them. God, after all, gives generously and ungrudgingly to all people. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But they should ask in faith, with no doubts. A person who doubts is like a wave of the sea which the wind blows and tosses about.
