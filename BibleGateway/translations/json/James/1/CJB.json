[{"num":1,"verse":"From: Ya‘akov, a slave of God and of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah"},{"num":2,"verse":"Regard it all as joy, my brothers, when you face various kinds of temptations; "},{"num":3,"verse":"for you know that the testing of your trust produces perseverance. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But let perseverance do its complete work; so that you may be complete and whole, lacking in nothing. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Now if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives to all generously and without reproach; and it will be given to him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But let him ask in trust, doubting nothing; for the doubter is like a wave in the sea being tossed and driven by the wind. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Indeed that person should not think that he will receive anything from the Lord, "},{"num":8,"verse":"because he is double-minded, unstable in all his ways."},{"num":9,"verse":"Let the brother in humble circumstances boast about his high position. "},{"num":10,"verse":"But let the rich brother boast about his being humbled; since, like a wildflower, he will pass away. "},{"num":11,"verse":"For just as the sun rises with the sharav and dries up the plant, so that its flower falls off and its beauty is destroyed, so too the rich person going about his business will wither away."},{"num":12,"verse":"How blessed is the man who perseveres through temptation! For after he has passed the test, he will receive as his crown the Life which God has promised to those who love him. "},{"num":13,"verse":"No one being tempted should say, “I am being tempted by God.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, and God himself tempts no one. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Rather, each person is being tempted whenever he is being dragged off and enticed by the bait of his own desire. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Then, having conceived, the desire gives birth to sin; and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Don’t delude yourselves, my dear brothers."},{"num":17,"verse":"Every good act of giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father who made the heavenly lights; with him there is neither variation nor darkness caused by turning. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Having made his decision, he gave birth to us through a Word that can be relied upon, in order that we should be a kind of firstfruits of all that he created. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Therefore, my dear brothers, let every person be quick to listen but slow to speak, slow to get angry; "},{"num":20,"verse":"for a person’s anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness!"},{"num":21,"verse":"So rid yourselves of all vulgarity and obvious evil, and receive meekly the Word implanted in you that can save your lives. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Don’t deceive yourselves by only hearing what the Word says, but do it! "},{"num":23,"verse":"For whoever hears the Word but doesn’t do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror, "},{"num":24,"verse":"who looks at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. "},{"num":25,"verse":"But if a person looks closely into the perfect Torah, which gives freedom, and continues, becoming not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work it requires, then he will be blessed in what he does."},{"num":26,"verse":"Anyone who thinks he is religiously observant but does not control his tongue is deceiving himself, and his observance counts for nothing. "},{"num":27,"verse":"The religious observance that God the Father considers pure and faultless is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being contaminated by the world."}]
