It’s no trouble for me to write the same things to you, and it’s safe for you."},{"num":2,"verse":"Watch out for the dogs! Watch out for the ‘bad works’ people! Watch out for the ‘incision’ party, that is, the mutilators! "},{"num":3,"verse":"We are the ‘circumcision’, you see – we who worship God by the spirit, and boast in King Jesus, and refuse to trust in the flesh."},{"num":4,"verse":"Mind you, I’ve got good reason to trust in the flesh. If anyone else thinks they have reason to trust in the flesh, I’ve got more. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Circumcised? On the eighth day. Race? Israelite. Tribe? Benjamin. Descent? Hebrew through and through. Torah-observance? A Pharisee. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Zealous? I persecuted the church! Official status under the law? Blameless."},{"header":"Gaining the Messiah"},{"num":7,"verse":"Does that sound as though my account was well in credit? Well, maybe; but whatever I had written in on the profit side, I calculated it instead as a loss – because of the Messiah. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Yes, I know that’s weird, but there’s more: I calculate everything as a loss, because knowing King Jesus as my Lord is worth far more than everything else put together! In fact, because of the Messiah I’ve suffered the loss of everything, and I now calculate it as trash, so that my profit may be the Messiah, "},{"num":9,"verse":"and that I may be discovered in him, not having my own covenant status defined by Torah, but the status which comes through the Messiah’s faithfulness: the covenant status from God which is given to faith.

It means sharing the form and pattern of his death, "},{"num":11,"verse":"so that somehow I may arrive at the final resurrection from the dead."},{"header":"Chasing on to the Finish"},{"num":12,"verse":"I’m not implying that I’ve already received ‘resurrection’, or that I’ve already become complete and mature! No; I’m hurrying on, eager to overtake it, because King Jesus has overtaken me. "},{"num":13,"verse":"My dear family, I don’t reckon that I have yet overtaken it. But this is my one aim: to forget everything that’s behind, and to strain every nerve to go after what’s ahead.
