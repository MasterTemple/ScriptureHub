"},{"num":3,"verse":"The act of becoming a Jew has nothing to do with us becoming Christians. We worship God through His Spirit and are proud of Jesus Christ. We have no faith in what we ourselves can do. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I could have reason to trust in the flesh. If anyone could feel that the flesh could do something for him, I could. "},{"num":5,"verse":"I went through the religious act of becoming a Jew when I was eight days old. I was born a Jew and came from the family group of Benjamin. I was a Jewish son of Jewish parents. I belonged to the group of the proud religious law-keepers. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I followed my religion with all my heart and did everything I could to make it hard for the church.
