His mother’s name was Hephzibah. In ’s judgment he was a bad king—an evil king. He reintroduced all the moral rot and spiritual corruption that had been scoured from the country when  dispossessed the pagan nations in favor of the children of Israel. He rebuilt all the sex-and-religion shrines that his father Hezekiah had torn down, and he built altars and phallic images for the sex god Baal and sex goddess Asherah, exactly what Ahab king of Israel had done. He worshiped the cosmic powers, taking orders from the constellations. He even built these pagan altars in The Temple of , the very Jerusalem Temple dedicated exclusively by ’s decree (“in Jerusalem I place my Name”) to ’s Name. And he built shrines to the cosmic powers and placed them in both courtyards of The Temple of . He burned his own son in a sacrificial offering. He practiced black magic and fortunetelling. He held séances and consulted spirits from the underworld. Much evil—in ’s judgment, a career in evil. And  was angry."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"As a last straw he placed the carved image of the sex goddess Asherah in The Temple of , a flagrant and provocative violation of ’s well-known statement to both David and Solomon, “In this Temple and in this city Jerusalem, my choice out of all the tribes of Israel, I place my Name—exclusively and forever. Never again will I let my people Israel wander off from this land I gave to their ancestors. But here’s the condition: They must keep everything I’ve commanded in the instructions my servant Moses passed on to them.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But the people didn’t listen.

I’ll wipe out Jerusalem as you would wipe out a dish, wiping it out and turning it over to dry. I’ll get rid of what’s left of my inheritance, dumping them on their enemies. If their enemies can salvage anything from them, they’re welcome to it. They’ve been nothing but trouble to me from the day their ancestors left Egypt until now. They pushed me to my limit; I won’t put up with their evil any longer.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The final word on Manasseh was that he was an indiscriminate murderer. He drenched Jerusalem with the innocent blood of his victims. That’s on top of all the sins in which he involved his people. As far as  was concerned, he’d turned them into a nation of sinners."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The rest of the life and times of Manasseh, everything he did and his sorry record of sin, is written in .
