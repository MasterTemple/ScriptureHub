"},{"num":3,"verse":"Some time later the girl said, “If your husband Naaman would go to the prophet in Samaria, he would be cured of his leprosy.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"When Naaman told the king what the girl had said, "},{"num":5,"verse":"the king replied, “Go ahead! I will give you a letter to take to the king of Israel.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"He also carried the letter to the king of Israel. It said, “I am sending my servant Naaman to you. Would you cure him of his leprosy?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in fear and shouted, “That Syrian king believes I can cure this man of leprosy! Does he think I’m God with power over life and death? He must be trying to pick a fight with me.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"As soon as Elisha the prophet heard what had happened, he sent the Israelite king this message: “Why are you so afraid?

"},{"num":10,"verse":"Elisha sent someone outside to say to him, “Go wash seven times in the Jordan River. Then you’ll be completely cured.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"But Naaman stormed off, grumbling, “Why couldn’t he come out and talk to me? I thought for sure he would stand in front of me and pray to the Lord his God, then wave his hand over my skin and cure me. "},{"num":12,"verse":"What about the Abana River or the Pharpar River?

I could have washed in them and been cured.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"His servants went over to him and said, “Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it.
