Then he would cure him of his skin disease.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The king of Syria said, “Go!

Can I kill or restore life? Why does he ask me to cure a man of his skin disease? Certainly you must see that he is looking for an excuse to fight me!”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When Elisha the prophet heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent this message to the king, “Why did you tear your clothes?

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"His servants approached and said to him, “O master, if the prophet had told you to do some difficult task, you would have been willing to do it. It seems you should be happy that he simply said, ‘Wash and you will be healed.’ "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, as the prophet had instructed. His skin became as smooth as a young child’s and he was healed."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He and his entire entourage returned to the prophet. Naaman came and stood before him.
