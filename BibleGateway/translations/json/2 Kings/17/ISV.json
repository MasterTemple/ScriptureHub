"},{"num":3,"verse":"King Shalmaneser of Assyria attacked him, and Hoshea became his servant and paid tribute to him. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But the king of Assyria uncovered a conspiracy involving Hoshea, who had sent envoys to King So of Egypt and stopped offering tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done annually. As a result, the king of Assyria placed him under arrest and sent him to prison. "},{"num":5,"verse":"After this, the king of Assyria invaded the entire land, approached Samaria, and began a three year siege. "},{"num":6,"verse":"As a result, during the ninth year of the reign of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and took the Israelis off to Assyria, placing them in Halah, along the Habor River in Gozan, and in cities ruled by the Medes."},{"header":"The Idolatry of the Northern Kingdom"},{"num":7,"verse":"This happened because the Israelis had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt and from the domination of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, because they were fearing other gods, "},{"num":8,"verse":"and because they were following the rules of the nations whom the Lord had expelled before the Israelis and that the kings of Israel had practiced."},{"num":9,"verse":"The Israelis practiced secret things that were not right, offending the Lord their God. In addition, they built high places for use by all their towns, watchtowers, and fortified cities. "},{"num":10,"verse":"They set up pillars and Asherim on every high hill and in the shade of every green tree, "},{"num":11,"verse":"where they made offerings on all the high places, as did the nations whom the Lord had expelled before them. They also practiced other wickedness, provoking the Lord to become angry, "},{"num":12,"verse":"and they served idols, a practice that the Lord had warned them, “You are not to do this.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Nevertheless, the Lord had warned both Israel and Judah by means of every prophet and seer: “Turn away from your evil practices and keep my commandments and statutes according to the entire Law that I gave your ancestors and that I sent to you through my servants, the prophets.” "},{"num":14,"verse":"But they would not listen. Instead, they were stubborn, just like their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the Lord their God. "},{"num":15,"verse":"They rejected the Lord’s statutes, the covenant that he had made with their ancestors, and his warnings that he gave them. They pursued meaninglessness—and became meaningless themselves—as they followed the lifestyles of the nations that surrounded them, a practice that the Lord had warned them not to do."},{"num":16,"verse":"They abandoned all of the commands given by the Lord their God, crafted for themselves cast images of two calves, constructed an Asherah, worshipped all of the stars in heaven, and served Baal. "},{"num":17,"verse":"They passed their sons and daughters through fire, practiced divination, cast spells, and sold themselves to practice what the Lord considered to be evil, thereby provoking him.

No one was left except for the tribe of Judah."},{"num":19,"verse":"But Judah, too, did not keep the commands of the Lord their God.

Look how the lions are killing them, because they don’t know the law of the god of the land!”"},{"num":27,"verse":"So the king of Assyria issued this order: “Take one of the priests whom you carried away and let him go back and live there.
