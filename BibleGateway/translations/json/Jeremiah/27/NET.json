"},{"num":3,"verse":"Use it to send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon. Send them through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to King Zedekiah of Judah. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Charge them to give their masters a message from me. Tell them, ‘The Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says to give your masters this message: "},{"num":5,"verse":"“I made the earth and the people and animals on it by my mighty power and great strength, and I give it to whomever I see fit. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I have at this time placed all these nations of yours under the power of my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have even made all the wild animals subject to him. "},{"num":7,"verse":"All nations must serve him and his son and grandson until the time comes for his own nation to fall. Then many nations and great kings will in turn subjugate Babylon. "},{"num":8,"verse":"But suppose a nation or a kingdom will not be subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Suppose it will not submit to the yoke of servitude to him. I, the Lord, affirm that I will punish that nation. I will use the king of Babylon to punish it with war, starvation, and disease until I have destroyed it.

That’s what the Lord says will happen to any nation that will not be subject to the king of Babylon. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Do not listen to the prophets who are telling you that you do not need to serve the king of Babylon. For they are prophesying lies to you. "},{"num":15,"verse":"For I, the Lord, affirm that I did not send them. They are prophesying lies to you in my name. If you listen to them, I will drive you and the prophets who are prophesying lies out of the land and you will all die in exile.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"I also told the priests and all the people, “The Lord says, ‘Do not listen to what your prophets are saying.
