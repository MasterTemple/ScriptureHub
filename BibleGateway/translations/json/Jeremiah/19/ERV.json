I have a message I want you to announce there."},{"num":3,"verse":"Say to those who are with you, ‘King of Judah and people of Jerusalem, listen to this message from the Lord! This is what the Lord All-Powerful, the God of the people of Israel, says: I will soon make a terrible thing happen to this place! Everyone who hears about it will be amazed and full of fear."},{"num":4,"verse":"I will do these things because the people of Judah have stopped following me. They have made this a place for foreign gods. The people of Judah have burned sacrifices in this place to other gods. The people long ago did not worship those gods.

I will make this city like Topheth.’ This message is from the Lord."},{"num":13,"verse":"‘The houses in Jerusalem will become as “dirty” as this place, Topheth.

They gave drink offerings to false gods.’”"},{"num":14,"verse":"Then Jeremiah left Topheth where the Lord had told him to speak.
