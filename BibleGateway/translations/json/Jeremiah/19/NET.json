This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, has said, “Look here! I am about to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it ring. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I will do so because these people have rejected me and have defiled this place.

"},{"num":5,"verse":"They have built places here for worship of the god Baal so that they could sacrifice their children as burnt offerings to him in the fire.
