This is what the Lord says about you: You will not be killed with a sword."},{"num":5,"verse":"You will die in a peaceful way. People made funeral fires to honor your ancestors, the kings who ruled before you became king. In the same way people will make a funeral fire to honor you.

If you have fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you, you must let them go free after they have served you for six years.” But your ancestors did not listen to me or pay attention to me."},{"num":15,"verse":"A short time ago you changed your hearts to do what is right. Everyone set free their fellow Hebrews who were slaves. And you even made an agreement before me in the Temple that is called by my name."},{"num":16,"verse":"But now you have changed your minds. You have shown that you do not honor my name because each of you has taken back the male and female slaves that you had set free. You have forced them to become slaves again.’"},{"num":17,"verse":"“So this is what the Lord says: ‘You people have not obeyed me. You have not given freedom to your fellow Hebrews.

Their bodies will become food for the birds of the air and for the wild animals of the earth."},{"num":21,"verse":"I will give King Zedekiah of Judah and his leaders to their enemies and to everyone who wants to kill them. I will give Zedekiah and his people to the army of the king of Babylon, even though that army has left Jerusalem."},{"num":22,"verse":"But I will give the order,’ says the Lord, ‘to bring the Babylonian army back to Jerusalem. That army will fight against Jerusalem. They will capture it, set it on fire, and burn it down. And I will destroy the towns in the land of Judah. They will become empty deserts. No one will live there.’”"}]
