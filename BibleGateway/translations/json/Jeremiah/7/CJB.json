[{"num":7,"verse":"This word came to Yirmeyahu from Adonai: "},{"num":2,"verse":"“Stand at the gate of the house of Adonai and proclaim this word: ‘Listen to the word of Adonai, all you from Y’hudah who enter these gates to worship Adonai! "},{"num":3,"verse":"Here is what Adonai-Tzva’ot, the God of Isra’el, says: “Improve your ways and actions, and I will let you stay in this place. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Don’t rely on that deceitful slogan, ‘The temple of Adonai, the temple of Adonai — these [buildings] are the temple of Adonai.’ "},{"num":5,"verse":"No, but if you really improve your ways and actions; if you really administer justice between people; "},{"num":6,"verse":"if you stop oppressing foreigners, orphans and widows; if you stop shedding innocent blood in this place; and if you stop following other gods, to your own harm; "},{"num":7,"verse":"then I will let you stay in this place, in the land I gave to your ancestors forever and ever. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Look! You are relying on deceitful words that can’t do you any good. "},{"num":9,"verse":"First you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, offer to Ba‘al and go after other gods that you haven’t known. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then you come and stand before me in this house that bears my name and say, ‘We are saved’ — so that you can go on doing these abominations! "},{"num":11,"verse":"Do you regard this house, which bears my name, as a cave for bandits? I can see for myself what’s going on,” says Adonai. "},{"num":12,"verse":"“Go to the place in Shiloh that used to be mine, that used to bear my name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Isra’el.

Now,” says Adonai, “because you have done all these things, "},{"num":14,"verse":"I will do to the house that bears my name, on which you rely, and to the place I gave you and your ancestors, what I did to Shiloh; "},{"num":15,"verse":"and I will drive you out of my presence, just as I drove out all your kinsmen, all the descendants of Efrayim.”’"},{"num":16,"verse":"“So you, [Yirmeyahu,] don’t pray for this people! Don’t cry, pray or intercede on their behalf with me; because I won’t listen to you.

In everything, live according to the way that I order you, so that things will go well for you.’ "},{"num":24,"verse":"But they neither listened nor paid attention, but lived according to their own plans, in the stubbornness of their evil hearts, thus going backward and not forward.
