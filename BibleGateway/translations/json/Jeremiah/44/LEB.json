And look, they are a site of ruins this day, and there is not in them an inhabitant, "},{"num":3,"verse":"because of their wickedness that they committed to provoke me to anger by going to make smoke offerings, serving other gods whom they had not known, neither they, you, or your ancestors. "},{"num":4,"verse":"And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending over and over again, saying, “Please, you must not do this detestable thing that I hate.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"But they did not listen and they did not incline their ears to turn back from their wickedness, to not make smoke offerings to other gods. "},{"num":6,"verse":"So my wrath and my anger were poured out and burned in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became as a site of ruins, as a desolation, as they are this day.’"},{"num":7,"verse":"So then, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, to cut off for yourselves man and woman, child and suckling, from the midst of Judah, to not leave over for yourselves a remnant, "},{"num":8,"verse":"provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, to make smoke offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to dwell as aliens, so as to cut off yourselves, and so that you are becoming as a curse, and as a disgrace among all the nations of the earth?

Thus your land became as a site of ruins, and as a horror, and as a curse, without inhabitants, as it is this day. "},{"num":23,"verse":"Because of the fact that you made smoke offerings, and that you sinned against Yahweh, and you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you have not walked in his law, and in his statute, and in his legal provisions, therefore this disaster has happened to you, as it is this day.”"},{"num":24,"verse":"Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
