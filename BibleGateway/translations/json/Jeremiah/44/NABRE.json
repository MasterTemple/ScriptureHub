Today they lie in ruins uninhabited, "},{"num":3,"verse":"because of the evil they did to provoke me, going after other gods, offering incense and serving other gods they did not know, neither they, nor you, nor your ancestors. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Though I repeatedly sent you all my servants the prophets, saying: “You must not commit this abominable deed I hate,” "},{"num":5,"verse":"they did not listen or incline their ears in order to turn from their evil, no longer offering incense to other gods. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Therefore the fury of my anger poured forth and kindled fire in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, to turn them into the ruined wasteland they are today."},{"num":7,"verse":"Now thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why inflict so great an evil upon yourselves, cutting off from Judah man and woman, child and infant, not leaving yourselves even a remnant? "},{"num":8,"verse":"Why do you provoke me with the works of your hands, offering sacrifice to other gods here in the land of Egypt where you have come to live? Will you cut yourselves off and become a curse, a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
