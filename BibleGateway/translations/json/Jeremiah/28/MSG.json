You’ll no longer be in harness to him.’”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Prophet Jeremiah stood up to prophet Hananiah in front of the priests and all the people who were in ’s Temple that day. Prophet Jeremiah said, “Wonderful! Would that it were true—that  would validate your preaching by bringing the Temple furnishings and all the exiles back from Babylon.
