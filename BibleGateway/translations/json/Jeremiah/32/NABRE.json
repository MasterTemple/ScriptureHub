"},{"num":2,"verse":"At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, while Jeremiah the prophet was confined to the court of the guard, in the house of the king of Judah. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Zedekiah, king of Judah, had confined him there, saying: “How dare you prophesy: Thus says the Lord: I am handing this city over to the king of Babylon that he may capture it. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Zedekiah, king of Judah, shall not escape the hands of the Chaldeans: he shall indeed be handed over to the king of Babylon. He shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He shall take Zedekiah to Babylon. There he shall remain, until I attend to him—oracle of the Lord. If you fight against the Chaldeans, you cannot win!”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Jeremiah said, This word came to me from the Lord: "},{"num":7,"verse":"Hanamel, son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you with the offer: “Purchase my field in Anathoth, since you, as nearest relative, have the first right of purchase.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"And, just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard and said, “Please purchase my field in Anathoth, in the territory of Benjamin; as nearest relative, you have the first right of possession—purchase it for yourself.” Then I knew this was the word of the Lord. "},{"num":9,"verse":"So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, weighing out for him the silver, seventeen shekels of silver."},{"num":10,"verse":"When I had written and sealed the deed, called witnesses and weighed out the silver on the scales, "},{"num":11,"verse":"I accepted the deed of purchase, both the sealed copy, containing title and conditions, and the open copy.

"},{"num":15,"verse":"For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: They shall again purchase houses and fields and vineyards in this land."},{"num":16,"verse":"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch, son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord: "},{"num":17,"verse":"Ah, my Lord God! You made the heavens and the earth with your great power and your outstretched arm; nothing is too difficult for you. "},{"num":18,"verse":"You continue your kindness through a thousand generations; but you repay the ancestors’ guilt upon their children who follow them.

"},{"num":23,"verse":"They went in and took possession of it, but they did not listen to your voice. They did not live by your law; they did not do anything you commanded them to do. Then you made all this evil fall upon them. "},{"num":24,"verse":"See, the siegeworks have arrived at this city to capture it; the city is handed over to the Chaldeans who are attacking it, with sword, starvation, and disease. What you threatened has happened—you can see it for yourself. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Yet you told me, my Lord God: Purchase the field with silver and summon witnesses, when the city has already been handed over to the Chaldeans!"},{"num":26,"verse":"Then this word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: "},{"num":27,"verse":"I am the Lord, the God of all the living!

"},{"num":31,"verse":"This city has so stirred my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, that I must put it out of my sight, "},{"num":32,"verse":"for all the evil the Israelites and Judahites have done to provoke me—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. "},{"num":33,"verse":"They turned their backs to me, not their faces; though I taught them persistently, they would not listen or accept correction. "},{"num":34,"verse":"Instead they set up their abominations in the house which bears my name in order to defile it. "},{"num":35,"verse":"They built high places to Baal in the Valley of Ben-hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech; I never commanded them to do this, nor did it even enter my mind that they would practice this abomination, so as to bring sin upon Judah."},{"num":36,"verse":"Now, therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city, which you say is being handed over to the king of Babylon by means of the sword, starvation, and disease: "},{"num":37,"verse":"See, I am gathering them from all the lands to which I drove them in my rising fury and great anger; I will bring them back to this place and settle them here in safety.
