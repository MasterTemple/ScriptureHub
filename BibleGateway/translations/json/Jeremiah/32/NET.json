[{"header":"Jeremiah Buys a Field"},{"num":32,"verse":"In the tenth year that Zedekiah was ruling over Judah the Lord spoke to Jeremiah.

The prophet Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse attached to the royal palace of Judah. "},{"num":3,"verse":"For King Zedekiah had confined Jeremiah there after he had reproved him for prophesying as he did. He had asked Jeremiah, “Why do you keep prophesying these things? Why do you keep saying that the Lord says, ‘I will hand this city over to the king of Babylon? I will let him capture it. "},{"num":4,"verse":"King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Babylonians. He will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon. He must answer personally to the king of Babylon and confront him face to face. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Zedekiah will be carried off to Babylon and will remain there until I have fully dealt with him. I, the Lord, affirm it! Even if you continue to fight against the Babylonians, you cannot win.’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So now, Jeremiah said, “The Lord’s message came to me, "},{"num":7,"verse":"‘Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you soon. He will say to you, “Buy my field at Anathoth because you are entitled as my closest relative to buy it.”’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"And then my cousin Hanamel did come to me in the courtyard of the guardhouse in keeping with the Lord’s message. He said to me, ‘Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. Buy it for yourself since you are entitled as my closest relative to take possession of it for yourself.’ When this happened, I recognized that the Lord had indeed spoken to me. "},{"num":9,"verse":"So I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel. I weighed out seven ounces of silver and gave it to him to pay for it. "},{"num":10,"verse":"I signed the deed of purchase, sealed it, and had some men serve as witnesses to the purchase. I weighed out the silver for him on a scale. "},{"num":11,"verse":"There were two copies of the deed of purchase. One was sealed and contained the order of transfer and the conditions of purchase. The other was left unsealed. "},{"num":12,"verse":"I took both copies of the deed of purchase and gave them to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah.

By this means you gained both in Israel and among humankind a renown that lasts to this day.

By this means you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt. "},{"num":22,"verse":"You kept the promise that you swore on oath to their ancestors. You gave them a land flowing with milk and honey. "},{"num":23,"verse":"But when they came in and took possession of it, they did not obey you or live as you had instructed them. They did not do anything that you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Even now siege ramps have been built up around the city in order to capture it.
