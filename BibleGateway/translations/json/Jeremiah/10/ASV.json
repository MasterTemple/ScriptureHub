[{"num":10,"verse":"Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: "},{"num":2,"verse":"thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.

"},{"num":7,"verse":"Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.
