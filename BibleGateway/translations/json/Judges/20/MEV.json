"},{"num":5,"verse":"Then the leaders of Gibeah rose up against me. At night they surrounded the house where I was staying. They wanted to kill me; instead they ravished my concubine so that she died. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I seized my concubine, cut her into pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel, because they committed an infamous and disgraceful act in Israel.

"},{"num":31,"verse":"The Benjamites went out to engage the people and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike the people down as before. On the main roads that go up to Bethel and Gibeah and in the field, they struck down about thirty children of Israel. "},{"num":32,"verse":"The Benjamites said, “They are struck down before us like at the beginning.” But the children of Israel said, “Let us retreat and draw them away from the city toward the main roads.”"},{"num":33,"verse":"So all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and assumed their battle positions at Baal Tamar. Then the men of Israel in ambush charged out of their places, out of the meadows of Gibeah. "},{"num":34,"verse":"Ten thousand specially chosen men from all of Israel came against Gibeah. The battle was fierce, and the Benjamites did not know that disaster was upon them.

"},{"num":41,"verse":"Then the men of Israel turned around, and the men of Benjamin were horrified because they saw that disaster had come on them. "},{"num":42,"verse":"So they fled from the men of Israel toward the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. Whoever came out of the cities destroyed them in their midst. "},{"num":43,"verse":"They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them without rest, and trampled them down near Gibeah toward the east. "},{"num":44,"verse":"Eighteen thousand men from Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor. "},{"num":45,"verse":"The rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to Rimmon Rock, and they cut down five thousand men on the main roads. They pursued them relentlessly until they reached Gidom and killed two thousand of them."},{"num":46,"verse":"So the Benjamites who fell that day numbered twenty-five thousand, every one of them armed, valorous men. "},{"num":47,"verse":"However, six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness, to Rimmon Rock. They dwelled at Rimmon Rock for four months.
