"},{"num":3,"verse":"The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah."},{"num":4,"verse":"The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered, “I went to Gibeah in Benjamin with my concubine to spend the night. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Citizens of Gibeah came to attack me and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me, but they raped my concubine, and she died. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Then I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout Israel’s territory, because they have committed a wicked outrage in Israel. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Look, all of you are Israelites. Give your judgment and verdict here and now.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then all the people stood united and said, “None of us will go to his tent or return to his house. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will attack it. By lot "},{"num":10,"verse":"we will take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred out of every thousand, and one thousand out of every ten thousand to get provisions for the troops when they go to Gibeah in Benjamin to punish them for all the outrage they committed in Israel.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"So all the men of Israel gathered united against the city. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Then the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this evil act that has happened among you? "},{"num":13,"verse":"Hand over the wicked men in Gibeah so we can put them to death and purge evil from Israel.” But the Benjaminites would not listen to their fellow Israelites.

They fasted that day until evening and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the Lord. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Then the Israelites inquired of the Lord. In those days, the ark of the covenant of God was there, "},{"num":28,"verse":"and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, was serving before it. The Israelites asked, “Should we again fight against our brothers the Benjaminites or should we stop?”"},{"num":29,"verse":"So Israel set up an ambush around Gibeah. "},{"num":30,"verse":"On the third day the Israelites fought against the Benjaminites and took their battle positions against Gibeah as before. "},{"num":31,"verse":"Then the Benjaminites came out against the troops and were drawn away from the city.

"},{"num":32,"verse":"The Benjaminites said, “We are defeating them as before.”"},{"num":33,"verse":"So all the men of Israel got up from their places and took their battle positions at Baal-tamar, while the Israelites in ambush charged out of their places west of Geba.

"},{"num":35,"verse":"The Lord defeated Benjamin in the presence of Israel, and on that day the Israelites slaughtered 25,100 men of Benjamin; all were armed. "},{"num":36,"verse":"Then the Benjaminites realized they had been defeated."},{"num":37,"verse":"The men in ambush had rushed quickly against Gibeah; they advanced and put the whole city to the sword. "},{"num":38,"verse":"The men of Israel had a prearranged signal with the men in ambush: when they sent up a great cloud of smoke from the city, "},{"num":39,"verse":"the men of Israel would return to the battle. When Benjamin had begun to strike them down, killing about thirty men of Israel, they said, “They’re defeated before us, just as they were in the first battle.” "},{"num":40,"verse":"But when the column of smoke began to go up from the city, Benjamin looked behind them, and the whole city was going up in smoke. "},{"num":41,"verse":"Then the men of Israel returned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified when they realized that disaster had struck them. "},{"num":42,"verse":"They retreated before the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and those who came out of the cities slaughtered those between them.
