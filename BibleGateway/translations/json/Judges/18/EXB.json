[{"header":"The Tribe of Dan Captures Laish"},{"num":18,"verse":"At that time Israel did not have a king [17:6]. And at that time the tribe of Dan was still ·looking for a land [seeking an inheritance] where they could live, a land of their own. The Danites had not yet ·been given their own land [moved into their land; received their allotment] among the tribes of Israel. "},{"num":2,"verse":"So, from their family groups, they chose five ·soldiers [valiant men; men, sons of strength] from the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out and explore the land. They were told, “Go, explore the land.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"When they came near Micah’s house, they recognized the ·voice [or accent] of the young Levite [17:7]. So they stopped there and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing here? ·Why are you here [What is your business here]?”"},{"num":4,"verse":"He told them what Micah had done for him, saying, “He hired me. I am his priest.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"They said to him, “Please ask God if ·our journey [our mission; the way we are going] will be successful.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"The priest said to them, “Go in peace. The Lord ·is pleased with [approves of; watches over] your journey.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"So the five men left. When they came to the city of Laish, they saw that the people there lived in safety, ·like [according to the custom of] the people of Sidon. They ·thought they were safe [were quiet and secure/unsuspecting] and ·had plenty of everything [or no ruler was humiliating them]. They lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone else."},{"num":8,"verse":"When the five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their ·relatives [brothers] asked them, “What did you find?”"},{"num":9,"verse":"They answered, “We have seen the land, and it is very good. ·We should attack [Arise, let us go up against] them. ·Aren’t you going to do something [Are you just going to sit there]? Don’t ·wait [hesitate; or be lazy]! Let’s go and take that land! "},{"num":10,"verse":"When you go, you will see there is ·plenty of [a wide/spacious] land—·plenty of everything [lacking nothing]! The people are not expecting an attack. Surely God has handed that land over to us!”"},{"num":11,"verse":"So six hundred Danites left Zorah and Eshtaol ·ready for [armed with weapons of] war. "},{"num":12,"verse":"On their way they set up camp near the city of Kiriath Jearim in Judah. That is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is named Mahaneh Dan [“Camp of Dan”] to this day. "},{"num":13,"verse":"From there they traveled on to the ·mountains [hill country] of Ephraim. Then they came to Micah’s house."},{"num":14,"verse":"The five men who had explored the land around Laish said to their ·relatives [brothers], “Do you know in one of these houses there are a ·holy vest [ephod; Ex. 28:6–14], household gods [17:5], an ·idol, and a statue [or image overlaid with silver; 17:3]? ·You know [or Decide now] what to do.” "},{"num":15,"verse":"So they stopped at the Levite’s house, which was also Micah’s house, and ·greeted the Levite [or asked how he was doing]. "},{"num":16,"verse":"The six hundred ·Danites [men who were of the sons/descendants of Dan] stood at the entrance gate, wearing their weapons of war. "},{"num":17,"verse":"The five spies went into the house and took the ·idol [carved image], the ·holy vest [ephod], the household idols, and the ·statue [cast-metal image]. The priest and the six hundred men armed ·for [with weapons of] war stood by the entrance gate."},{"num":18,"verse":"When the spies went into Micah’s house and took the [carved] image, the ·holy vest [ephod], the household idols, and the ·statue [cast-metal image], the priest asked them, “What are you doing?”"},{"num":19,"verse":"They answered, “Be quiet! ·Don’t say a word [Put your hand over your mouth]. Come with us and be our father [meaning an advisor or counselor; 17:10; Gen. 45:8] and priest. Is it better for you to be a priest for one man’s house or for a tribe and ·family group [clan] in Israel?” "},{"num":20,"verse":"This ·made the priest happy [pleased the heart of the priest]. So he took the ·holy vest [ephod], the household idols [17:5], and the ·idol [carved image] and went with the ·Danites [people]. "},{"num":21,"verse":"They left Micah’s house, putting their little children, their animals, and everything they owned in front of them [for protection in case of attack; Gen. 33:2–3]."},{"num":22,"verse":"When they had gone a little way from Micah’s house, the men who lived near Micah ·were called out [assembled] and caught up with them. "},{"num":23,"verse":"The men with Micah shouted at the ·Danites [sons/descendants of Dan], who turned around and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you? Why have you ·been called out to [assembled for a] fight?”"},{"num":24,"verse":"Micah answered, “You took my gods that I made and my priest. What do I have left? How can you ask me, ‘What’s the matter?’”"},{"num":25,"verse":"The ·Danites [sons/descendants of Dan] answered, “·You should not argue with [or Don’t say another word to; Don’t let your voice be heard among] us. Some of our ·angry [bitter] men might attack you, ·killing you [and you will lose your life] and your ·family [household].” "},{"num":26,"verse":"Then the ·Danites [sons/descendants of Dan] went on their way. Micah knew they were too strong for him, so he turned and went back home."},{"num":27,"verse":"Then the Danites took what Micah had made and his priest and went on to Laish. They attacked those ·peaceful [quiet] and ·unsuspecting [secure] people and killed them with their swords and then burned the city. "},{"num":28,"verse":"There was no one to ·save [rescue; deliver] the people of Laish. They lived too far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else.
