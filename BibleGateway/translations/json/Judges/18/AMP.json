"},{"num":2,"verse":"So the sons of Dan sent from the total number of their [extended] family five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to scout the land and to explore it; and they said to them, “Go, explore the land.” They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. "},{"num":3,"verse":"When they passed near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite, and they turned aside there and said to him, “Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?” "},{"num":4,"verse":"And he said to them, “Micah has done this and that for me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest.” "},{"num":5,"verse":"And they said to him, “Please ask of God, so that we may know whether our journey on which we are going will be successful.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"The priest said to them, “Go in peace; the journey on which you are going is acceptable to the Lord.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then the five men went on and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, [how they were] living securely in the style of the Sidonians, quiet and peaceful; and there was no oppressive magistrate in the land humiliating them in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone. "},{"num":8,"verse":"The five men came back [home] to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brothers said to them, “What do you have to report?” "},{"num":9,"verse":"They said, “Arise, let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good (fertile).

"},{"num":17,"verse":"Now the five men who had gone to scout the land went up and entered the house and took the image [of silver-plated wood], the ephod, the teraphim, and the cast image [of solid silver], while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war. "},{"num":18,"verse":"When these [five men] went into Micah’s house and took the [plated] image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the cast image, the priest asked them, “What are you doing?” "},{"num":19,"verse":"They said to him, “Keep quiet, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?” "},{"num":20,"verse":"The priest’s heart was glad [to hear that], and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the image, and went among the people."},{"num":21,"verse":"So they turned and left, and they put the children, the livestock, and the valuables and supplies in front of them.
