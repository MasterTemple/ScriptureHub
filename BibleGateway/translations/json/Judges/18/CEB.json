They told them, “Go explore the land.” So they went into the Ephraim highland as far as Micah’s house, and they spent the night there."},{"num":3,"verse":"When they were in the area of Micah’s house, they recognized the accent of the young Levite. They turned in there and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in these parts? What is there for you here?”"},{"num":4,"verse":"“Micah has done a lot for me,” he replied to them. “He hired me to be his personal priest.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"They said to him, “Ask for an answer from God so we can know whether we’ll be successful on this trip we’ve taken.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"The priest replied to them, “Go in peace. The Lord is watching over you on this trip you’ve taken.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"So the five men journeyed on until they reached Laish. There they saw that its people were living without worry in the same way as the Sidonians, undisturbed and secure. Nobody held back anything in the land, so no one had to hoard.

Come with us and be a father and a priest for us. Would you rather be a priest for one man’s household or a priest for a tribe and a clan in Israel?”"},{"num":20,"verse":"The priest was convinced, so he took the priestly vest, the divine images, and the sculpted image and went along with the people."},{"num":21,"verse":"They headed back on their way, but they put the children, the livestock, and the prized possessions in front of them."},{"num":22,"verse":"After they had gone a good distance away from Micah’s house, the men who were in the houses around Micah’s home were summoned for battle and caught up to the Danites."},{"num":23,"verse":"They called out to the Danites, who turned around and said to Micah, “Why have you summoned men for battle?”"},{"num":24,"verse":"Micah replied, “You’ve taken my gods that I made, and the priest, and have gone off! What do I have left? How can you ask me what is wrong?”"},{"num":25,"verse":"But the Danites said to him, “Don’t raise your voice with us or else hotheaded men will attack you, and you and your household will lose your lives.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"Then the Danites went on their way.
