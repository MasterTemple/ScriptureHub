Don’t say a word. Come with us. Be our father and our priest. Is it better for you to be a priest for the people in one man’s house?

Some of our men have hot tempers. If you shout at us, they might attack you. You and your family might be killed.” "},{"num":26,"verse":"Then the men of Dan went on their way. Micah knew they were too strong for him. So he turned and went back home."},{"num":27,"verse":"So the men of Dan took what Micah had made. They also took his priest and went on to Laish. They attacked those peaceful people. The people of Laish had not expected an attack. The men of Dan killed them with their swords. Then they burned the city.
