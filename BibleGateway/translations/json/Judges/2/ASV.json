But ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this? "},{"num":3,"verse":"Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you. "},{"num":4,"verse":"And it came to pass, when the angel of Jehovah spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto Jehovah."},{"num":6,"verse":"Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
