This time when I wreak havoc on the Philistines, I’m blameless.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Samson then went out and caught three hundred jackals. He lashed the jackals’ tails together in pairs and tied a torch between each pair of tails. He then set fire to the torches and let them loose in the Philistine fields of ripe grain.
