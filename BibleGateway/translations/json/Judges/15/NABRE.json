Her younger sister is better; you may have her instead.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"Samson said to him, “This time I am guiltless if I harm the Philistines.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"So Samson went and caught three hundred jackals, and turning them tail to tail, he took some torches and tied one between each pair of tails. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He then kindled the torches and set the jackals loose in the standing grain of the Philistines, thus burning both the shocks and standing grain, the vineyards and olive groves."},{"num":6,"verse":"When the Philistines asked, “Who has done this?” they were told, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because his wife was taken and given to his best man.” So the Philistines went up and destroyed her and her family by fire.
