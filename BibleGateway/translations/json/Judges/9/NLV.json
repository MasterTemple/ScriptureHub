Should all seventy of Jerubbaal’s sons rule over you? Or should one man rule over you? Remember that I am your own bone and flesh.’” "},{"num":3,"verse":"So his mother’s family spoke all these words for him in the ears of the leaders of Shechem. And they decided to follow Abimelech.

The other two groups then rushed against all who were in the field and killed them. "},{"num":45,"verse":"Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He took the city and killed the people who were in it. Then he destroyed the city and covered it with salt."},{"num":46,"verse":"All the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard about it. And they went into the inside room of the house of the god of El-berith. "},{"num":47,"verse":"Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. "},{"num":48,"verse":"So Abimelech and all who were with him went up to Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees. Then he lifted it onto his shoulder. He said to the men who were with him, “Hurry and do what you have seen me do.” "},{"num":49,"verse":"So each of the men cut down his branch also, and followed Abimelech. They put the branches around the inside room and set it on fire. So all the men of the tower of Shechem died. There were about 1,000 men and women in all."},{"num":50,"verse":"Then Abimelech went to Thebez. He fought against it and took it.

And they went up on the roof of the tower. "},{"num":52,"verse":"Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it. He went near the door of the building to burn it with fire. "},{"num":53,"verse":"But a certain woman threw a grain-crushing stone on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. "},{"num":54,"verse":"Abimelech was quick to call the young man who carried his heavy battle-clothes, saying, “Take your sword and kill me. Or else it will be said that a woman killed me.” So the young man killed him with a sword. "},{"num":55,"verse":"When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each man went home. "},{"num":56,"verse":"So God punished Abimelech for the sin he had done against his father by killing his seventy brothers. "},{"num":57,"verse":"God punished the men of Shechem for all their sin. The words that Jotham the son of Jerubbaal spoke against them came true."}]
