Do you really want all of Jerubbaal’s 70 sons to rule you or just one man? Remember, I’m your own flesh and blood.’”"},{"num":3,"verse":"His uncles repeated everything he said to all citizens of Shechem. They were persuaded to follow Abimelech because he was their relative. "},{"num":4,"verse":"So they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the temple of Baal Berith. With the silver, Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men to follow him. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Then he went to his father’s home in Ophrah. There he executed his 70 brothers, Jerubbaal’s sons. But Jotham, Jerubbaal’s youngest son, survived because he hid.

"},{"num":18,"verse":"But today you have attacked my father’s family. You have executed his 70 sons.

"},{"num":24,"verse":"God did this so that the bloody violence committed against Jerubbaal’s 70 sons would happen to Abimelech and citizens of Shechem. Citizens of Shechem had helped Abimelech execute his brothers."},{"num":25,"verse":"So citizens of Shechem set ambushes for Abimelech on top of the mountains.
