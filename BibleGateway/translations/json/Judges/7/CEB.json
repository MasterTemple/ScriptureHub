If I were to hand Midian over to them, the Israelites might claim credit for themselves rather than for me, thinking, We saved ourselves."},{"num":3,"verse":"So now, announce in the people’s hearing, ‘Anyone who is afraid or unsteady may return home from Gideon’s mountain.’” At this, twenty-two thousand people went home, and ten thousand were left."},{"num":4,"verse":"The Lord said to Gideon, “There are still too many people. Take them down to the water, and I will weed them out for you there. Whenever I tell you, ‘This one will go with you,’ he should go with you; but whenever I tell you, ‘This one won’t go with you,’ he should not go.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So he took the people down to the water.

He said, “Get this! I had a dream that a loaf of barley bread was rolling into the Midianite camp. It came to a tent and hit it, and the tent collapsed. In fact, it rolled the tent over upside down, so it fell flat.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"His friend replied, “Can this be anything other than the sword of the Israelite Gideon, Joash’s son? God has handed over Midian and its entire camp to him!”"},{"num":15,"verse":"When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its meaning, he worshipped.

The Lord has handed over the Midianite camp to you.”"},{"num":16,"verse":"He divided the three hundred men into three units and equipped every man with a trumpet and an empty jar, with a torch inside each jar."},{"num":17,"verse":"“Now watch me,” he ordered them, “and do what I do. When I get to the outpost of the camp, do just what I do."},{"num":18,"verse":"When I blow the trumpet, along with all who are with me, then you blow the trumpets, all of you surrounding the whole camp.
