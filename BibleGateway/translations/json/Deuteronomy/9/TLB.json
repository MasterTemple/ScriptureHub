"},{"num":5,"verse":"It is not at all because you are such fine, upright people that the Lord will drive them out from before you! I say it again, it is only because of the wickedness of the other nations, and because of his promises to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he will do it. "},{"num":6,"verse":"I say it yet again: Jehovah your God is not giving you this good land because you are good, for you are not—you are a wicked, stubborn people."},{"num":7,"verse":"“Don’t you remember (oh, never forget it!) how continually angry you made the Lord your God out in the wilderness, from the day you left Egypt until now?
