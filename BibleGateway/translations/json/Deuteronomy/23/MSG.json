Those nations didn’t treat you with hospitality on your travels out of Egypt, and on top of that they also hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Mesopotamia to curse you. God, your God, refused to listen to Balaam but turned the curse into a blessing—how God, your God, loves you!

Along with your weapons have a stick with you. After you relieve yourself, dig a hole with the stick and cover your excrement.
