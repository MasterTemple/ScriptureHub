[{"header":"Introduction to Moses’ First Address"},{"num":1,"verse":"These are the words that Moses spoke to all the people of Israel while they were in the wilderness east of the Jordan River.

Go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the neighboring regions—the Jordan Valley, the hill country, the western foothills, the Negev, and the coastal plain. Go to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, and all the way to the great Euphrates River."},{"num":8,"verse":"Look, I am giving all this land to you! Go in and occupy it, for it is the land the Lord swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to all their descendants.’”"},{"header":"Moses Appoints Leaders from Each Tribe"},{"num":9,"verse":"Moses continued, “At that time I told you, ‘You are too great a burden for me to carry all by myself."},{"num":10,"verse":"The Lord your God has increased your population, making you as numerous as the stars!"},{"num":11,"verse":"And may the Lord, the God of your ancestors, multiply you a thousand times more and bless you as he promised!"},{"num":12,"verse":"But you are such a heavy load to carry!

Some were responsible for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for fifty, and some for ten."},{"num":16,"verse":"“At that time I instructed the judges, ‘You must hear the cases of your fellow Israelites and the foreigners living among you. Be perfectly fair in your decisions"},{"num":17,"verse":"and impartial in your judgments. Hear the cases of those who are poor as well as those who are rich. Don’t be afraid of anyone’s anger, for the decision you make is God’s decision. Bring me any cases that are too difficult for you, and I will handle them.’"},{"num":18,"verse":"“At that time I gave you instructions about everything you were to do."},{"header":"Scouts Explore the Land"},{"num":19,"verse":"“Then, just as the Lord our God commanded us, we left Mount Sinai and traveled through the great and terrifying wilderness, as you yourselves remember, and headed toward the hill country of the Amorites.

That’s why he has brought us here from Egypt—to hand us over to the Amorites to be slaughtered."},{"num":28,"verse":"Where can we go? Our brothers have demoralized us with their report. They tell us, “The people of the land are taller and more powerful than we are, and their towns are large, with walls rising high into the sky! We even saw giants there—the descendants of Anak!”’"},{"num":29,"verse":"“But I said to you, ‘Don’t be shocked or afraid of them!"},{"num":30,"verse":"The Lord your God is going ahead of you.
