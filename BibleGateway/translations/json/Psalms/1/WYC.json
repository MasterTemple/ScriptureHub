(But his delight is in the Law of the Lord; and he shall think about his Law day and night.)"},{"num":3,"verse":"And he shall be as a tree, which is planted beside the runnings of waters; that shall give his fruit in his time. And his leaf shall not fall down; and all things, whichever he shall do, shall have prosperity. (And he shall be like a tree, which is planted beside the running water; it shall give its fruit at its proper time, and its leaves shall not fall down. Yea, everything, whatever he shall do, shall prosper.)"},{"num":4,"verse":"Not so wicked men, not so; but they be as dust, which the wind casteth away from the face of the earth.
