But (if) the Lord keepeth the city; he waketh in vain that keepeth it. (The song of degrees for Solomon. Unless the Lord build the house; those who have built it, have laboured in vain. Unless the Lord guardeth the city; he who standeth watch, guardeth in vain.)"},{"num":2,"verse":"It is vain to you to rise before the light; rise ye after ye have set, that eat the bread of sorrow.
