[{"num":42,"verse":"1 The Prophet grievously complaineth, that being letted by his persecutors, he could not be present in the congregation of God’s people, protesting that although he was separated in body from them, yet his heart was thitherward affectioned. 7 And least of all he showed that he was not so far overcome with these sorrows and thoughts, 8 but that he continually put his confidence in the Lord."},{"num":1,"verse":"As the Hart brayeth for the rivers of water, so panted my soul after thee, O God."},{"num":2,"verse":"My soul thirsteth for God, even for the living God: when shall I come and appear before the presence of God?"},{"num":3,"verse":"Mine tears have been my meat day and night, while they daily say unto me, Where is thy God?"},{"num":4,"verse":"When I remembered these things, I poured out my very heart, because I had gone with the multitude, and led them into the house of God with the voice of singing, and praise, as a multitude that keepeth a feast."},{"num":5,"verse":"Why art thou cast down, my soul, and unquiet within me? wait on God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his presence."},{"num":6,"verse":"My God, my soul is cast down within me, because I remembered thee, from the land of Jordan, and Hermon, and from the mount Mizar."},{"num":7,"verse":"One deep calleth another deep by the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy floods are gone over me."},{"num":8,"verse":"The Lord will grant his loving-kindness in the day, and in the night shall I sing of him, even a prayer unto the God of my life."},{"num":9,"verse":"I will say unto God, which is my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning, when the enemy oppresseth me?"},{"num":10,"verse":"My bones are cut asunder, while mine enemies reproach me, saying daily unto me, Where is thy God?"},{"num":11,"verse":"Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? wait on God: for I will yet give him thanks: he is my present help and my God."}]
