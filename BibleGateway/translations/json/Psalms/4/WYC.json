Have thou mercy on me; and hear thou my prayer. (To victory, on instruments, the song of David. Please answer me when I call thee, O God of my righteousness. For when I was in trouble, thou set me free, or at large. So have thou mercy on me; and hear thou my prayer.)"},{"num":2,"verse":"Sons of men, how long be ye of heavy heart? why love ye vanity, and seek leasing?
