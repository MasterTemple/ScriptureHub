[{"header":"God Is Good to His People"},{"num":78,"verse":"O my people, hear my teaching. Listen to the words of my mouth. "},{"num":2,"verse":"I will open my mouth in picture-stories. I will tell things which have been kept secret from long ago, "},{"num":3,"verse":"which we have heard and known because our fathers have told us. "},{"num":4,"verse":"We will not hide them from their children. But we will tell the children-to-come the praises of the Lord, and of His power and the great things He has done."},{"num":5,"verse":"For He has made His will known to Jacob. He made the Law in Israel, which He told our fathers to teach their children. "},{"num":6,"verse":"So the children-to-come might know, even the children yet to be born. So they may rise up and tell it to their children. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Then they would put their trust in God and not forget the works of God. And they would keep His Law. "},{"num":8,"verse":"They would not be like their fathers, who were not right with God and would not obey Him or be faithful to Him."},{"num":9,"verse":"The sons of Ephraim were ready with their bows. But they turned away in the day of fighting. "},{"num":10,"verse":"They did not keep the agreement of God. And they would not walk in His Law. "},{"num":11,"verse":"They forgot what He had done and His great works that He had shown them. "},{"num":12,"verse":"He did powerful works in front of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. "},{"num":13,"verse":"He divided the sea and made them pass through it. He made the water stand up like a wall. "},{"num":14,"verse":"He led them with the cloud during the day, and with a light of fire during the night. "},{"num":15,"verse":"He broke the rocks in the desert, and gave them water as if it flowed from the sea. "},{"num":16,"verse":"He made water come out of the rock. He made the water flow down like rivers."},{"num":17,"verse":"But they still kept on sinning against Him. They did not obey the Most High in the desert. "},{"num":18,"verse":"They tested God in their hearts by asking for the food they wanted. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Then they spoke against God, saying, “Can God set a table in the desert? "},{"num":20,"verse":"See, He hit the rock and water poured out and rivers flowed over. Can He give bread also? Will He give meat to His people?”"},{"num":21,"verse":"The Lord was full of anger when He heard them. And a fire was set against Jacob. His anger went up against Israel, "},{"num":22,"verse":"because they did not believe in God. They did not trust in Him to save them. "},{"num":23,"verse":"Yet He spoke to the clouds above, and opened the doors of heaven. "},{"num":24,"verse":"He sent down bread from heaven for them to eat. He gave them food from heaven. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Men ate the bread of angels. He sent them all the food they could eat. "},{"num":26,"verse":"He made the east wind blow in the heavens. And He brought in the south wind by His power. "},{"num":27,"verse":"He sent meat down on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the sea. "},{"num":28,"verse":"He let them fall in the place where they were staying, all around their tents. "},{"num":29,"verse":"So they ate until they were full. He gave them what they wanted. "},{"num":30,"verse":"But before they had eaten all they wanted, even while it was still in their mouths, "},{"num":31,"verse":"the anger of God came upon them. And He killed the strongest of them. He cut down the young men of Israel. "},{"num":32,"verse":"But still they kept on sinning. They did not believe in His powerful works. "},{"num":33,"verse":"So He made their days come to nothing. He made their years end in fear all at once."},{"num":34,"verse":"When He killed some of them, the others would look for Him. They returned and looked for God. "},{"num":35,"verse":"They remembered that God was their rock, and that the Most High God was the One Who set them free. "},{"num":36,"verse":"But they gave Him false honor with their mouth. They lied to Him with their tongue. "},{"num":37,"verse":"For their heart was not right toward Him. They were not faithful to His agreement. "},{"num":38,"verse":"But He showed them loving-kindness and forgave their sins. He did not destroy them. He held back His anger many times. He did not let all of His anger loose. "},{"num":39,"verse":"He remembered that they were only flesh, a wind that passes and does not return."},{"num":40,"verse":"How many times they went against Him in the desert, and gave Him sorrow in that empty land! "},{"num":41,"verse":"They put God to the test again and again, and troubled the Holy One of Israel. "},{"num":42,"verse":"They did not remember His power and the day He saved them from those who hated them, "},{"num":43,"verse":"when He did His powerful works in Egypt and showed His greatness in the field of Zoan. "},{"num":44,"verse":"He changed their rivers into blood. They could not drink from their rivers. "},{"num":45,"verse":"He sent many flies among them that ate them, and frogs that destroyed them. "},{"num":46,"verse":"He gave their fields of food to the grasshopper, and all they worked for to the locust. "},{"num":47,"verse":"He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with cold. "},{"num":48,"verse":"He killed their cattle with hail and lightning. "},{"num":49,"verse":"He sent them His burning anger and trouble. He sent a group of angels to bring trouble and sorrow to them. "},{"num":50,"verse":"He made a straight path for His anger. He did not save their soul from death. But He gave their lives over to all these troubles. "},{"num":51,"verse":"He killed all the first-born in Egypt, the first children of their strength in the tents of Ham. "},{"num":52,"verse":"But He brought His people out like sheep. And He led them like a flock in the desert. "},{"num":53,"verse":"He led them and kept them safe, so they were not afraid. But the sea covered those who hated them."},{"num":54,"verse":"He brought them to His holy land, to the hill country His right hand had taken. "},{"num":55,"verse":"He drove out the nations before them. He gave them parts of the land for a gift. And He made the families of Israel live in their tents."},{"num":56,"verse":"But they tempted and went against the Most High God. They did not keep His Law. "},{"num":57,"verse":"They turned away and acted without faith like their fathers. They were like a bow that cannot be trusted. "},{"num":58,"verse":"They made Him angry with their sinful places of worship. And they made Him jealous with their false gods. "},{"num":59,"verse":"God was very angry when He heard them, and He hated Israel. "},{"num":60,"verse":"He left the holy tent at Shiloh, the tent He had set up among men. "},{"num":61,"verse":"And He let His strength be taken. He put His greatness into the hands of those who hated Israel. "},{"num":62,"verse":"He allowed His people to be killed with the sword. And He was very angry with those who belong to Him. "},{"num":63,"verse":"Fire burned up their young men. And their young women had no wedding songs. "},{"num":64,"verse":"Their religious leaders fell by the sword. And the women who lost their husbands could not cry."},{"num":65,"verse":"Then the Lord woke up as if from sleep, like a strong man wild with wine. "},{"num":66,"verse":"He beat back those who hated Him. And He put them to shame forever. "},{"num":67,"verse":"He turned away from the tent of Joseph. He did not choose the family of Ephraim, "},{"num":68,"verse":"but chose the family of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved. "},{"num":69,"verse":"He built His holy place like the high mountains, like the earth He has built forever. "},{"num":70,"verse":"He chose David, His servant and took him from the flocks of sheep. "},{"num":71,"verse":"He brought him from caring for the sheep and their lambs to being the shepherd of Jacob His people, and Israel who belongs to Him. "},{"num":72,"verse":"So David was their shepherd with a heart that was right, and led them with good hands and wisdom."}]
