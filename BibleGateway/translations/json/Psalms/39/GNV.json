[{"num":39,"verse":"1 David uttereth with what great grief and bitterness of mind he was driven to these outrageous complaints of his infirmities. 2 For he confesseth that when he had determined silence, that he brast forth yet into words, that he would not, through the greatness of his grief. 4 Then he rehearseth certain requests which taste of the infirmity of man. 8 And mixeth with them many prayers: but all do show a mind wonderfully trembled, that it may plainly appear how he did strive mightily against death and desperation."},{"num":1,"verse":"I thought, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth bridled, while the wicked is in my sight."},{"num":2,"verse":"I was dumb and spake nothing: I kept silence even from good, and my sorrow was more stirred."},{"num":3,"verse":"Mine heart was hot within me, and while I was musing, the fire kindled, and I spake with my tongue, saying,"},{"num":4,"verse":"Lord, let me know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: let me know how long I have to live."},{"num":5,"verse":"Behold, thou hast made my days as an hand breadth, and mine age as nothing in respect of thee: surely every man in his best state is altogether vanity. Selah."},{"num":6,"verse":"Doubtless man walketh in a shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them."},{"num":7,"verse":"And now Lord, what wait I for? mine hope is even in thee."},{"num":8,"verse":"Deliver me from all my transgressions, and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish."},{"num":9,"verse":"I should have been dumb, and not have opened my mouth, because thou didst it."},{"num":10,"verse":"Take thy plague away from me: for I am consumed by the stroke of thine hand."},{"num":11,"verse":"When thou with rebukes dost chastise man for iniquity, thou as a moth makest his beauty to consume: surely every man is vanity. Selah."},{"num":12,"verse":"Hear my prayer, O Lord, and hearken unto my cry: keep not silence at my tears, for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers."},{"num":13,"verse":"Stay thine anger from me, that I may recover my strength, before I go hence and be not."}]
