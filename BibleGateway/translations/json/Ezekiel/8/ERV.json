[{"header":"Sinful Things Done at the Temple"},{"num":8,"verse":"One day I, Ezekiel, was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting there in front of me. This was on the fifth day of the sixth month of the sixth year of exile. Suddenly, the power of the Lord God came on me."},{"num":2,"verse":"I saw something that looked like fire, like a man’s body. From the waist down, he was like fire. From the waist up, he was bright and shining like hot metal in a fire."},{"num":3,"verse":"Then I saw something that looked like an arm. The arm reached out and grabbed me by the hair on my head. Then the Spirit lifted me into the air, and in a vision from God he took me to Jerusalem. He took me to the inner gate—the gate that is on the north side. The statue that makes God jealous is by that gate."},{"num":4,"verse":"But the Glory of the God of Israel was there. The Glory looked just like the vision I saw in the valley by the Kebar Canal."},{"num":5,"verse":"God spoke to me. He said, “Son of man, look toward the north.” So I looked, and there, north of the Altar Gate by the entrance, was that statue that made God jealous."},{"num":6,"verse":"Then God said to me, “Son of man, do you see what terrible things the people of Israel are doing?

There were pictures of those animals carved all around on every wall!"},{"num":11,"verse":"Then I noticed that Jaazaniah son of Shaphan and the 70 elders of Israel were there with the people worshiping in that place. There they were, right at the front of the people, and each leader had his own incense dish in his hand. The smoke from the burning incense was rising into the air."},{"num":12,"verse":"Then God said to me, “Son of man, do you see what the elders of Israel do in the dark?

Come with me and you will see things that are even worse than this!”"},{"num":16,"verse":"Then he led me to the inner courtyard of the Lord’s Temple area.

They were bowing down to worship the sun!"},{"num":17,"verse":"Then God said, “Son of man, do you see this? The people of Judah think my Temple is so unimportant that they will do these terrible things here in my Temple! This country is filled with violence, and they constantly do things to make me angry.

They will shout to me—but I refuse to listen to them!”"}]
