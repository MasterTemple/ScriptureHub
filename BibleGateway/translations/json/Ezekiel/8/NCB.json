[{"header":"Chapter 8"},{"num":1,"verse":"Idolatry in the Temple. In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, as I was sitting in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting beside me, suddenly the hand of the Lord fell upon me there."},{"num":2,"verse":"As I looked, I beheld a figure that had the form of a man. From the area of his waist downward, he appeared to be like fire, and upward from his waist, he seemed to have a brilliance like gleaming amber."},{"num":3,"verse":"He stretched forth what appeared to be a hand and grasped me by a lock of my hair. A Spirit then lifted me up between earth and heaven, and in divine visions he brought me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner north gate, where stood the idol that arouses one to jealousy."},{"num":4,"verse":"The glory of the God of Israel was present before me, like the vision I had seen in the valley."},{"num":5,"verse":"Then the Lord said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” I raised my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the temple gate, a statue of jealousy stood at the entrance."},{"num":6,"verse":"He asked, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing? Behold the loathsome abominations that the house of Israel is engaging in here in their determination to drive me out of my sanctuary.

Upon the wall were depicted the carved figures of every kind of creeping thing and loathsome animals and all the idols of the house of Israel."},{"num":11,"verse":"Before them stood seventy of the elders of the house of Israel, including Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan. Each of them held a censer in his hand, and all the fragrance of the incense ascended upward."},{"num":12,"verse":"Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each one at the shrine of his own idol?

Is it not bad enough for the house of Judah to do the loathsome things they have done here? They have filled the land with violence and provoked me to anger time after time.

No matter how loudly they may cry out to me, I will not listen to them.”"}]
