[{"header":"Ezekiel’s Vision of Jerusalem"},{"num":8,"verse":"It was the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month of our captivity.

From the waist down it looked like fire, and from the waist up it looked like bright glowing metal. "},{"num":3,"verse":"It stretched out the shape of a hand and caught me by the hair on my head. The Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the sky. He took me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance to the north gate of the inner courtyard of the Temple.
