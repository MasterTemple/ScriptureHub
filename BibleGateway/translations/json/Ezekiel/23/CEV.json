They became my wives and gave birth to my children."},{"num":5,"verse":"Even though Oholah was my wife, she continued to be a prostitute and chased after Assyrian lovers. "},{"num":6,"verse":"She offered herself to soldiers in purple uniforms, to every handsome, high-ranking officer, and to cavalry troops. "},{"num":7,"verse":"She had sex with all the important Assyrian officials and even worshiped their disgusting idols. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Once she started doing these things in Egypt, she never stopped. Men slept with her, and she was always ready for sex."},{"num":9,"verse":"So I gave Oholah to the Assyrian lovers she wanted so badly.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"Just like her sister, she did vulgar things."},{"num":14,"verse":"But Oholibah behaved worse than her sister.

They have even stopped respecting the Sabbath."},{"num":40,"verse":"They sent messengers to attract men from far away. When those men arrived, the two sisters took baths and put on eye shadow and jewelry.
