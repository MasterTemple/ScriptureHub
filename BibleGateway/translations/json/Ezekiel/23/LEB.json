"},{"num":4,"verse":"Now as for their names, the older was Oholah, and Oholibah was her sister. And they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters, and their names are Samaria for Oholah, and Jerusalem for Oholibah. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And Oholah prostituted herself while she was still mine, and she lusted for her lovers, for Assyria who was nearby, "},{"num":6,"verse":"clothed in blue cloth, governors and prefects, handsome young men and all of them horsemen, experts on horseback. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And she bestowed her fornication on them, on the choice ones of the Assyrians, all of them, and with every one after which she lusted; with all of their idols she defiled herself.

"},{"num":37,"verse":"For they committed adultery, and blood is on their hands, and they committed adultery with their idols, and even their children that they had borne for me—they sacrificed them as food! "},{"num":38,"verse":"Also they did this to me: they defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they profaned my Sabbaths, "},{"num":39,"verse":"and when they slaughtered their children for their idols, they came to my sanctuary on that day to profane it. And look, this is what they did in my house! "},{"num":40,"verse":"What is worse, they sent for men who come from a distant place, to whom a messenger was sent to them, and look! They came! Men for whom you bathed and painted your eyes, and you adorned yourself with an ornament. "},{"num":41,"verse":"And you sat on a magnificent couch and a table prepared before her, and my incense and my olive oil you put on her. "},{"num":42,"verse":"And a sound of a carefree crowd was with it, and in addition to these men, a crowd of drunken men was brought in from the desert, and they put bracelets on their arms and a crown of splendor on their heads. "},{"num":43,"verse":"And I said to the one worn out with adulteries, ‘Now they will prostitute her concerning her fornication, even her.’ "},{"num":44,"verse":"And so they went to her like going to a female prostitute; and thus they went to Oholah and to Oholibah, the women of obscene conduct.
