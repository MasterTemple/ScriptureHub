[{"num":23,"verse":"The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying, "},{"num":2,"verse":"Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: "},{"num":3,"verse":"and they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity. "},{"num":4,"verse":"And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah."},{"num":5,"verse":"And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors, "},{"num":6,"verse":"who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Neither hath she left her whoredoms since the days of Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their whoredom upon her.

"},{"num":38,"verse":"Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. "},{"num":39,"verse":"For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
