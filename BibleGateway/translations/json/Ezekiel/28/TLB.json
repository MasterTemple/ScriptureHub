[{"num":28,"verse":"Here is another message given to me from the Lord:"},{"num":2,"verse":"“Son of dust, say to the prince of Tyre, ‘The Lord God says: You are so proud you think you are God, sitting on the throne of a god on your island home in the midst of the seas. But you are only a man and not a god, though you boast yourself to be like God. You are wiser than Daniel, for no secret is hidden from you. "},{"num":4,"verse":"You have used your wisdom and understanding to get great wealth—gold and silver and many treasures. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Yes, your wisdom has made you very rich and very proud.’”"},{"num":6,"verse":"Therefore the Lord God says: “Because you claim that you are as wise as God, "},{"num":7,"verse":"an enemy army, the terror of the nations, shall suddenly draw their swords against your marvelous wisdom and defile your splendor! "},{"num":8,"verse":"They will bring you to the pit of hell, and you shall die as those pierced with many wounds, there on your island in the heart of the seas. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Then will you boast as a god? At least to these invaders you will be no god, but merely man! "},{"num":10,"verse":"You will die like an outcast at the hands of foreigners. For I have spoken it,” the Lord God says."},{"num":11,"verse":"Then this further message came to me from the Lord:"},{"num":12,"verse":"“Son of dust, weep for the king of Tyre. Tell him, ‘The Lord God says: You were the perfection of wisdom and beauty.

They were given to you on the day you were created. "},{"num":14,"verse":"I appointed you to be the anointed Guardian Angel. You had access to the holy mountain of God. You walked among the stones of fire."},{"num":15,"verse":"“‘You were perfect in all you did from the day you were created until that time when wrong was found in you. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Your great wealth filled you with internal turmoil, and you sinned. Therefore, I cast you out of the mountain of God like a common sinner. I destroyed you, O Guardian Angel, from the midst of the stones of fire. "},{"num":17,"verse":"Your heart was filled with pride because of all your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. Therefore, I have cast you down to the ground and exposed you helpless before the curious gaze of kings.
