So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"“And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage, and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted, that he might water it."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters, that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"“Say, Thus says the Lord : Will it thrive?
