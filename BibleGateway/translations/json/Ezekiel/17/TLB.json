[{"num":17,"verse":"Then this message came to me from the Lord:"},{"num":2,"verse":"“Son of dust, give this riddle to the people of Israel:"},{"num":3,"verse":"“A great eagle with broad wings full of many-colored feathers came to Lebanon and plucked off the shoot at the top of the tallest cedar tree and carried it into a city filled with merchants.

"},{"num":6,"verse":"It took root and grew and became a low but spreading vine that turned toward the eagle and produced strong branches and luxuriant leaves. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But when another great, broad-winged, full-feathered eagle came along, this tree sent its roots and branches out toward him instead, "},{"num":8,"verse":"even though it was already in good soil with plenty of water to become a splendid vine, producing leaves and fruit.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"The Lord God asks: “Shall I let this tree grow and prosper? No! I will pull it out, roots and all! I will cut off its branches and let its leaves wither and die. It will pull out easily enough—it won’t take a big crew or a lot of equipment to do that.

I will tell you. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon (the first of the two eagles), came to Jerusalem, took away her king and princes (her topmost buds and shoots),* and brought them to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar made a covenant with a member of the royal family (Zedekiah),* and made him take an oath of loyalty. He took a seedling and planted it in fertile ground beside a broad river. He also exiled the top men of Israel’s government, "},{"num":14,"verse":"so that Israel would not be strong again and revolt. But by keeping her promises, Israel could be respected and maintain her identity."},{"num":15,"verse":"“Nevertheless, Zedekiah rebelled against Babylon, sending ambassadors to Egypt to seek for a great army and many horses to fight against Nebuchadnezzar.
