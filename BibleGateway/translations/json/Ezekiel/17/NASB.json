So it became a vine and produced shoots and sent out branches."},{"num":7,"verse":"“But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine turned its roots toward him and sent out its branches toward him from the beds where it was planted, so that he might water it."},{"num":8,"verse":"It was planted in good soil beside abundant waters, so that it would produce branches and bear fruit, and become a splendid vine.”’"},{"num":9,"verse":"Say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Will it thrive?
