"},{"num":4,"verse":"He plucked the top of its new plant shoot, and he brought it to the land of Canaan and put it in a city of merchants, "},{"num":5,"verse":"and he took from the seed of the land and placed it in fertile soil on many waters; like a willow he planted it. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And it sprouted, and it became a vine spreading out, low of height, turning its branches to him, and its roots were under it, and it became a vine, and it made branches, and it sent out foliage."},{"num":7,"verse":"“‘“And there was another great eagle, great of wings and with abundant plumage, and look! This vine stretched out its roots toward him and extended its branches to him to water it from the garden bed where it was planted.
