"},{"num":4,"verse":"He cropped off the top of its young twigs and carried it into a land of merchants. He set it in a city of dealers."},{"num":5,"verse":"He took also some of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful field. He placed it by great waters and set it as a willow tree. "},{"num":6,"verse":"It grew and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under it. So it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs."},{"num":7,"verse":"There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. And this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him, that he might water it by the bed where it was planted. "},{"num":8,"verse":"It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a splendid vine."},{"num":9,"verse":"Say: Thus says the Lord God: Will it thrive?
