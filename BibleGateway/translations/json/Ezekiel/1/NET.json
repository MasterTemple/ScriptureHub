As for the faces and wings of the four of them, "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"their wings touched each other; they did not turn as they moved, but went straight ahead."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Their faces had this appearance: Each of the four had the face of a man, with the face of a lion on the right, the face of an ox on the left, and also the face of an eagle.
