There the hand of the Lord was on him."},{"num":4,"verse":"I looked, and I saw a violent storm coming out of the north – an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The centre of the fire looked like glowing metal, "},{"num":5,"verse":"and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, "},{"num":6,"verse":"but each of them had four faces and four wings. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, "},{"num":9,"verse":"and the wings of one touched the wings of another.

Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning."},{"num":15,"verse":"As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. "},{"num":16,"verse":"This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: they sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. "},{"num":17,"verse":"As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around."},{"num":19,"verse":"When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.
