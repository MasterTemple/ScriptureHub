[{"num":1,"verse":"The power of the Lord was upon me and I was carried away by the Spirit of the Lord to a valley full of old, dry bones that were scattered everywhere across the ground. He led me around among them, "},{"num":3,"verse":"and then he said to me:"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then he told me to speak to the bones and say: “O dry bones, listen to the words of God, "},{"num":5,"verse":"for the Lord God says, ‘See! I am going to make you live and breathe again! "},{"num":6,"verse":"I will replace the flesh and muscles on you and cover you with skin. I will put breath into you, and you shall live and know I am the Lord.’”"},{"num":7,"verse":"So I spoke these words from God, just as he told me to; and suddenly there was a rattling noise from all across the valley, and the bones of each body came together and attached to each other as they used to be. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then, as I watched, the muscles and flesh formed over the bones, and skin covered them, but the bodies had no breath. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Then he told me to call to the wind and say: “The Lord God says: Come from the four winds, O Spirit, and breathe upon these slain bodies, that they may live again.” "},{"num":10,"verse":"So I spoke to the winds as he commanded me, and the bodies began breathing; they lived and stood up—a very great army."},{"num":11,"verse":"Then he told me what the vision meant: “These bones,” he said, “represent all the people of Israel. They say: ‘We have become a heap of dried-out bones—all hope is gone.’ "},{"num":12,"verse":"But tell them, ‘The Lord God says: My people, I will open your graves of exile and cause you to rise again and return to the land of Israel. "},{"num":13,"verse":"And, then at last, O my people, you will know I am the Lord. "},{"num":14,"verse":"I will put my Spirit into you, and you shall live and return home again to your own land. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have done just what I promised you.’”"},{"num":15,"verse":"Again a message from the Lord came to me, saying:"},{"num":16,"verse":"“Take a stick and carve on it these words: ‘This stick represents Judah and her allied tribes.’ Then take another stick and carve these words on it: ‘This stick represents all the other tribes of Israel.’ "},{"num":17,"verse":"Now hold them together in your hand as one stick. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Tell these people (holding the sticks so they can see what you are doing), the Lord God says: ‘I will take the tribes of Israel and join them to Judah and make them one stick in my hand.’”"},{"num":21,"verse":"For the Lord God says: “I am gathering the people of Israel from among the nations and bringing them home from around the world to their own land, "},{"num":22,"verse":"to unify them into one nation. One king shall be king of them all; no longer shall they be divided into two nations.
