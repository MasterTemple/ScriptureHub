"},{"num":3,"verse":"You consumed milk, wore wool, and slaughtered fatlings, but the flock you did not pasture. "},{"num":4,"verse":"You did not strengthen the weak nor heal the sick nor bind up the injured. You did not bring back the stray or seek the lost but ruled them harshly and brutally. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So they were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and became food for all the wild beasts. They were scattered "},{"num":6,"verse":"and wandered over all the mountains and high hills; over the entire surface of the earth my sheep were scattered. No one looked after them or searched for them."},{"num":7,"verse":"Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: "},{"num":8,"verse":"As I live—oracle of the Lord God—because my sheep became plunder, because my sheep became food for wild beasts, for lack of a shepherd, because my shepherds did not look after my sheep, but pastured themselves and did not pasture my sheep, "},{"num":9,"verse":"therefore, shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: "},{"num":10,"verse":"Thus says the Lord God: Look!
