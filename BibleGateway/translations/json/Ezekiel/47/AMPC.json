[{"num":47,"verse":"Then he [my guide] brought me again to the door of the house [of the Lordâ€”the temple], and behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the front of the temple was toward the east; and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the temple, on the south side of the altar."},{"num":2,"verse":"Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around outside to the outer gate by the way that faces east, and behold, waters were running out on the right side."},{"num":3,"verse":"And when the man went on eastward with the measuring line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were ankle-deep."},{"num":4,"verse":"Again he measured a thousand cubits and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that reached to the knees.
