He had a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand, and he was standing in the gateway."},{"num":4,"verse":"The man said to me, “Son of man, look carefully and listen attentively, and pay close attention to all that I will show you. That is the reason why you were brought here. Report to the house of Israel everything that you see.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Then I beheld an outer wall that surrounded the temple on all sides. The length of the measuring rod that the man was holding was six cubits long, each cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth in length. He measured the thickness and the height of the wall; each was one rod."},{"num":6,"verse":"The East Gate. Then he went to the gate which faced eastward, mounted its steps, and measured the gate’s threshold; it was one rod deep."},{"num":7,"verse":"Each cell was one rod long and one rod wide, and the walls between the cells measured five cubits. The threshold of the gate adjoining the vestibule of the gate at the inner end measured one rod."},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway,"},{"num":9,"verse":"which was eight cubits, and its pilasters, which were two cubits.

The width was twenty-five cubits from wall to wall."},{"num":14,"verse":"After this, he measured the vestibule, which was twenty cubits, and also the pilasters adjoining the court on either side, which were six cubits."},{"num":15,"verse":"From the front of the entrance gate to the far end of its portico, the distance was fifty cubits."},{"num":16,"verse":"Both the guardrooms and their pilasters had windows on the inside of the gateway, and the vestibules also had windows all around; the pilasters were decorated with palm trees."},{"num":17,"verse":"The Outer Court. Then he brought me to the outer court, where there were rooms and a paved terrace all around the court. There was a total of thirty rooms."},{"num":18,"verse":"The pavement was laid along the side of the gates, its width equaling the length of the gates. This was the lower pavement."},{"num":19,"verse":"Then he measured the width of the court, from the front of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; there were one hundred cubits between them."},{"num":20,"verse":"The North Gate.

Each window was fifty cubits in depth and twenty-five cubits in width."},{"num":26,"verse":"There were seven steps leading up to it.

These are the descendants of Zadok, who alone among the descendants of Levi are allowed to come near to minister to the Lord.”"},{"num":47,"verse":"Thereupon, he measured the court. It was a perfect square, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, with the altar standing in front of the temple."},{"num":48,"verse":"The Temple.
