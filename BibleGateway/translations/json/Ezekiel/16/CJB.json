"},{"num":4,"verse":"As for your birth — on the day you were born nobody cut your umbilical cord, washed you in water to clean you off, rubbed salt on you or wrapped you in cloth. "},{"num":5,"verse":"No one seeing you had enough pity on you to do any of these things for you — no one had any compassion on you. Instead, you were thrown into an open field in your own filth on the day you were born."},{"num":6,"verse":"“‘I passed by and saw you there, wallowing in your own blood; and as you lay in your blood I said to you, “Live!” Yes, I said to you, as you lay in your blood, “Live!

So I spread my cloak over you to cover your private parts and entered into a covenant with you,’ says Adonai Elohim, ‘and you became mine.

"},{"num":10,"verse":"I also clothed you with an embroidered gown, gave you fine leather sandals to wear, put a fine linen headband on your head and covered you with silk. "},{"num":11,"verse":"I gave you jewelry to wear, bracelets for your hands, a necklace for your neck, "},{"num":12,"verse":"a ring for your nose, earrings for your ears and a beautiful crown for your head. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Thus you were decked out in gold and silver; your clothing was of fine linen, silk and richly embroidered cloth; you ate the finest flour, honey and olive oil. You grew increasingly beautiful — you were fit to be queen.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"You took your clothes and used them to decorate with bright colors the high places you made for yourself, and there you continued prostituting yourself. Such things shouldn’t happen, and in the future they won’t. "},{"num":17,"verse":"You also took your beautiful jewels made of my gold and my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images, with which you continued to prostitute yourself. "},{"num":18,"verse":"You took your embroidered clothing and covered them; you set my olive oil and my incense in front of them; "},{"num":19,"verse":"and you took my food, which I had given you — my fine flour, olive oil and honey, that I had given you to eat — and set it in front of them to give a pleasant aroma. That is how it was,’ says Adonai Elohim."},{"num":20,"verse":"“‘Moreover, your sons and daughters, whom you bore me, you took and sacrificed for them to devour.

"},{"num":26,"verse":"You had sex with your big-membered Egyptian neighbors and engaged in fornication over and over, just to provoke me. "},{"num":27,"verse":"So now I have stretched out my hand over you, diminished your ration of food and put you at the mercy of those who hate you, the daughters of the P’lishtim, who find your lewd behavior revolting."},{"num":28,"verse":"“‘Still unsatisfied, you acted like a whore also with the people of Ashur; yes, you fornicated with them and were still not satisfied.

I am going to gather all your lovers, to whom you have been so very nice, all the ones you hate right along with all the ones you love — I will gather them against you from all over the place and expose your private parts to them, so that they will see you completely naked. "},{"num":38,"verse":"I will pronounce on you the sentence that applies to women who commit adultery and murder; I will bring on you the death [decreed for] furious jealousy.

"},{"num":50,"verse":"They were arrogant and committed disgusting acts before me; so that when I saw it, I swept them away. "},{"num":51,"verse":"Shomron did not commit even half as many sins as you did. You committed many more disgusting acts than your sisters; in fact, in comparison with all the disgusting acts you have committed, they seem innocent! "},{"num":52,"verse":"But you too must bear your disgrace; for by your passing judgment that your sisters were innocent, through your having committed sins worse than theirs, they are shown to be more righteous than you. So be ashamed, and bear the disgrace you deserve for making your [guilty] sisters seem innocent!"},{"num":53,"verse":"“‘I will end their exile — the exile of S’dom and her daughters, the exile of Shomron and her daughters, and the exile of your captives there among them; "},{"num":54,"verse":"so that you can bear your own shame and experience the disgrace you deserve for all you have done to shield them from feeling their own guilt.
