On the day you were born, you were unwanted, dumped in a field and left to die."},{"num":6,"verse":"“But I came by and saw you there, helplessly kicking about in your own blood. As you lay there, I said, ‘Live!’"},{"num":7,"verse":"And I helped you to thrive like a plant in the field. You grew up and became a beautiful jewel. Your breasts became full, and your body hair grew, but you were still naked."},{"num":8,"verse":"And when I passed by again, I saw that you were old enough for love. So I wrapped my cloak around you to cover your nakedness and declared my marriage vows.

You give gifts to your lovers, bribing them to come and have sex with you."},{"num":34,"verse":"So you are the opposite of other prostitutes.
