[{"header":"The King Sends Nehemiah to Jerusalem"},{"num":2,"verse":"In the month of Nisan in the 20th year of King Artaxerxes, some wine was brought to the king.

I think your heart is full of sadness.”"},{"num":3,"verse":"But even though I was afraid, I said to the king, “May the king live forever! I am sad because the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and the gates of that city have been destroyed by fire.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the king said to me, “What do you want me to do?”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Then I answered the king, “If it would please the king, and if I have been good to you, please send me to Jerusalem, the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried.

When will you get back here?”"},{"num":7,"verse":"I also said to the king, “If it would please the king to do something else for me, let me ask.

There were no horses with me except the horse I was riding."},{"num":13,"verse":"While it was dark I went out through the Valley Gate. I rode toward the Dragon Well and the Gate of the Ash Piles. I was inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates in the wall that had been burned with fire."},{"num":14,"verse":"Then I rode on toward the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool.

Finally, I turned back and went back in through the Valley Gate."},{"num":16,"verse":"The officials and important Israelites didn’t know where I had gone. They didn’t know what I was doing.
