"},{"num":2,"verse":"There were those who said, “With our sons and daughters, we are many. We must obtain grain in order to eat and stay alive.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"There were others who said, “We are putting up our fields, our vineyards, and our houses as collateral in order to obtain grain during the famine.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then there were those who said, “We have borrowed money to pay our taxes to the king on our fields and our vineyards. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And now, though we share the same flesh and blood as our fellow countrymen and our children are just like their children, still we have found it necessary to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have been subjected to slavery, while we are powerless to help, since our fields and vineyards now belong to other people.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints. "},{"num":7,"verse":"I considered these things carefully and then registered a complaint with the wealthy and the officials. I said to them, “Each one of you is seizing the collateral from your own countrymen!” Because of them I called for a great public assembly. "},{"num":8,"verse":"I said to them, “To the extent possible we have bought back our fellow Jews who had been sold to the Gentiles. But now you yourselves want to sell your own countrymen, so that we can then buy them back!” They were utterly silent, and could find nothing to say."},{"num":9,"verse":"Then I said, “The thing that you are doing is wrong! Should you not conduct yourselves in the fear of our God in order to avoid the reproach of the Gentiles who are our enemies?
