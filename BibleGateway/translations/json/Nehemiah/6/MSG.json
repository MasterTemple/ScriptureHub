Why should the work come to a standstill just so I can come down to see you?”"},{"num":4,"verse":"Four times they sent this message and four times I gave them my answer."},{"num":5,"verse":"The fifth time—same messenger, same message—Sanballat sent an unsealed letter with this message:"},{"num":6,"verse":"“The word is out among the nations—and Geshem says it’s true—that you and the Jews are planning to rebel. That’s why you are rebuilding the wall. The word is that you want to be king and that you have appointed prophets to announce in Jerusalem, ‘There’s a king in Judah!’ The king is going to be told all this—don’t you think we should sit down and have a talk?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"I sent him back this: “There’s nothing to what you’re saying.

Many of the nobles had ties to him because he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. They kept telling me all the good things he did and then would report back to him anything I would say. And then Tobiah would send letters to intimidate me."}]
