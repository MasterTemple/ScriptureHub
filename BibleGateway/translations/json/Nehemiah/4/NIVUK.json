[{"header":"Opposition to the rebuilding"},{"num":4,"verse":"When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews, "},{"num":2,"verse":"and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, ‘What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble – burned as they are?’"},{"num":3,"verse":"Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, ‘What they are building – even a fox climbing up on it would break down their wall of stones!’"},{"num":4,"verse":"Hear us, our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders."},{"num":6,"verse":"So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart."},{"num":7,"verse":"But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem’s walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry. "},{"num":8,"verse":"They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it. "},{"num":9,"verse":"But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat."},{"num":10,"verse":"Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, ‘The strength of the labourers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.’"},{"num":11,"verse":"Also our enemies said, ‘Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.’"},{"num":12,"verse":"Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, ‘Wherever you turn, they will attack us.’"},{"num":13,"verse":"Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows. "},{"num":14,"verse":"After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, ‘Don’t be afraid of them.
