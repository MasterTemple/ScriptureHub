"},{"num":2,"verse":"He said to his ·friends [colleagues; brothers] and ·those with power in [or the army/aristocracy of] Samaria, “What are these ·weak [feeble; pathetic] Jews doing? Will they ·rebuild the wall [or leave it all to God]? Will they offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in one day? Can they ·bring stones back to life from piles of trash and ashes [revive stones from piles of rubble—burnt stones at that]?”"},{"num":3,"verse":"Tobiah the Ammonite, who was ·next to Sanballat [beside him], said, “If a fox climbed up on the stone wall they are building, it would break it down.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"I prayed, “Hear us, our God.
