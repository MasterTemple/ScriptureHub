[{"num":1,"verse":"Woe is me! It is as hard to find an honest man as grapes and figs when harvest days are over. Not a cluster to eat, not a single early fig, however much I long for it! The good men have disappeared from the earth; not one fair-minded man is left. They are all murderers, turning against even their own brothers."},{"num":3,"verse":"They go at their evil deeds with both hands, and how skilled they are in using them! The governor and judge alike demand bribes. The rich man pays them off and tells them whom to ruin. Justice is twisted between them. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Even the best of them are prickly as briars; the straightest is more crooked than a hedge of thorns. But your judgment day is coming swiftly now; your time of punishment is almost here; confusion, destruction, and terror will be yours."},{"num":5,"verse":"Don’t trust anyone, not your best friend—not even your wife! "},{"num":6,"verse":"For the son despises his father; the daughter defies her mother; the bride curses her mother-in-law.

"},{"num":8,"verse":"Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy, for though I fall, I will rise again! When I sit in darkness, the Lord himself will be my Light.

God will bring me out of my darkness into the light, and I will see his goodness. "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then my enemy will see that God is for me and be ashamed for taunting, “Where is that God of yours?” Now with my own eyes I see them trampled down like mud in the street."},{"num":11,"verse":"Your cities, people of God, will be rebuilt, much larger and more prosperous than before.

You cannot stay angry with your people, for you love to be merciful. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Once again you will have compassion on us. You will tread our sins beneath your feet; you will throw them into the depths of the ocean! "},{"num":20,"verse":"You will bless us as you promised Jacob long ago. You will set your love upon us, as you promised our father Abraham!"}]
