A man from Bethlehem in Judah left home to live in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. The man’s name was Elimelech; his wife’s name was Naomi; his sons were named Mahlon and Kilion—all Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They all went to the country of Moab and settled there."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Elimelech died and Naomi was left, she and her two sons. The sons took Moabite wives; the name of the first was Orpah, the second Ruth. They lived there in Moab for the next ten years. But then the two brothers, Mahlon and Kilion, died. Now the woman was left without either her young men or her husband.* * *"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"One day she got herself together, she and her two daughters-in-law, to leave the country of Moab and set out for home; she had heard that  had been pleased to visit his people and give them food. And so she started out from the place she had been living, she and her two daughters-in-law with her, on the road back to the land of Judah."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"After a short while on the road, Naomi told her two daughters-in-law, “Go back. Go home and live with your mothers. And may  treat you as graciously as you treated your deceased husbands and me.

Why would you come with me? Do you suppose I still have sons in my womb who can become your future husbands? Go back, dear daughters—on your way, please! I’m too old to get a husband. Why, even if I said, ‘There’s still hope!’ and this very night got a man and had sons, can you imagine being satisfied to wait until they were grown? Would you wait that long to get married again? No, dear daughters; this is a bitter pill for me to swallow—more bitter for me than for you.  has dealt me a hard blow.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Again they cried openly.

The Strong One ruined me.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"And so Naomi was back, and Ruth the foreigner with her, back from the country of Moab.
