"},{"num":7,"verse":"The young woman said, ‘Please let me walk behind the workers. Let me pick up the grain that is left.’ She came into the field.

Don’t pick up grain in any other field. Don’t go anywhere else. Stay here with the women who work for me. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Keep your eye on the field where the men are cutting grain.

Dip it in the wine vinegar.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"Ruth got up to pick up more grain. Then Boaz gave orders to his men. He said, “Let her take some stalks from what the women have tied up. Don’t tell her she can’t. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Even pull out some stalks for her. Leave them for her to pick up. Don’t tell her she shouldn’t do it.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"So Ruth picked up grain in the field until evening. Then she separated the barley from the straw. The barley weighed 30 pounds.

He’s one of our family protectors.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"Then Ruth, who was from Moab, said, “He told me more. He even said, ‘Stay with my workers until they have finished bringing in all my grain.’ ”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Naomi replied to her daughter-in-law Ruth. She said, “That will be good for you, my daughter. Go with the women who work for him. You might be harmed if you go to someone else’s field.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"So Ruth stayed close to the women who worked for Boaz as she picked up grain. She worked until the time when all the barley and wheat had been harvested. And she lived with her mother-in-law."}]
