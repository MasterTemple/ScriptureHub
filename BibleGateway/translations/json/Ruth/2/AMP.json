[{"header":"Ruth Gleans in Boaz’ Field"},{"num":2,"verse":"Now Naomi had a relative of her husband, a man of great wealth and influence, from the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. "},{"num":2,"verse":"And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one [of the reapers] in whose sight I may find favor.” Naomi said to her, “Go, my daughter.” "},{"num":3,"verse":"So Ruth went and picked up the leftover grain in a field after the reapers; and she happened to stop at the plot of land belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. "},{"num":4,"verse":"It was then that Boaz came back from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The Lord be with you!” And they answered him, “The Lord bless you!” "},{"num":5,"verse":"Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?” "},{"num":6,"verse":"The servant in charge of the reapers answered, “She is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came and has continued [gathering grain] from early morning until now, except when she sat [resting] for a little while in the [field] house.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but stay here close by my maids. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Watch which field they reap, and follow behind them. I have commanded the servants not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, go to the [water] jars and drink from what the servants draw.” "},{"num":10,"verse":"Then she kneeled face downward, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes that you should notice me, when I am a foreigner?” "},{"num":11,"verse":"Boaz answered her, “I have been made fully aware of everything that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you did not know before.

"},{"num":15,"verse":"When she got up to glean, Boaz ordered his servants, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her. "},{"num":16,"verse":"Also you shall purposely pull out for her some stalks [of grain] from the sheaves and leave them so that she may collect them, and do not rebuke her.”"},{"num":17,"verse":"So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. "},{"num":18,"verse":"She picked it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned.

And she lived with her mother-in-law."}]
