[{"header":"Ruth and Boaz at the Threshing-Floor"},{"num":3,"verse":"Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, ‘My daughter, I need to seek some security for you, so that it may be well with you. "},{"num":2,"verse":"Now here is our kinsman Boaz, with whose young women you have been working. See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing-floor. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Now wash and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. "},{"num":4,"verse":"When he lies down, observe the place where he lies; then, go and uncover his feet and lie down; and he will tell you what to do.’ "},{"num":5,"verse":"She said to her, ‘All that you tell me I will do.’"},{"num":6,"verse":"So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-in-law had instructed her. "},{"num":7,"verse":"When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and he was in a contented mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came quietly and uncovered his feet, and lay down.
