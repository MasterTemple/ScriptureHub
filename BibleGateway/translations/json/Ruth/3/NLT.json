Tonight he will be winnowing barley at the threshing floor."},{"num":3,"verse":"Now do as I tell you—take a bath and put on perfume and dress in your nicest clothes. Then go to the threshing floor, but don’t let Boaz see you until he has finished eating and drinking."},{"num":4,"verse":"Be sure to notice where he lies down; then go and uncover his feet and lie down there.
