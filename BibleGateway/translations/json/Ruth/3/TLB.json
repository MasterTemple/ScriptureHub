[{"num":3,"verse":"One day Naomi said to Ruth, “My dear, isn’t it time that I try to find a husband for you and get you happily married again? "},{"num":2,"verse":"The man I’m thinking of is Boaz! He has been so kind to us and is a close relative. I happen to know that he will be winnowing barley tonight out on the threshing floor. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Now do what I tell you—bathe and put on some perfume and some nice clothes and go on down to the threshing floor, but don’t let him see you until he has finished his supper.
