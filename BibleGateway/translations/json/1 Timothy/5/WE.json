And be sure to keep a clean mind and heart in all this."},{"num":3,"verse":"Help widow women, whose husbands are dead, if they have no one to help them."},{"num":4,"verse":"If they have children or grandchildren, they should learn that the first place to do God's work is in the home to help their own family. They should help their parents because their parents have helped them. This will please God."},{"num":5,"verse":"A widow who has no one to help her, and is alone, trusts in God. Day and night she talks to God and asks him for the things she needs."},{"num":6,"verse":"But a woman who spends her time in pleasing herself is really dead, even while she still lives."},{"num":7,"verse":"Tell them these things so that they will do what is right."},{"num":8,"verse":"A man must care for his own people. At least he must care for his family. If he does not care for them, he shows that he does not believe in God. He is worse than one who has never believed."},{"num":9,"verse":"A widow who is over sixty years old, may be chosen to help the church people. But she must have been the wife of one husband."},{"num":10,"verse":"People must speak well of the good works she has done. Has she brought up children?

When they begin to love other things more than Christ, they will want to marry again."},{"num":12,"verse":"And that will be wrong for them because they have not kept their first promise."},{"num":13,"verse":"Not only that, but they also become lazy. They walk about going from house to house. Not only are they lazy but they talk too much and tell stories about people. They tell things they should not tell."},{"num":14,"verse":"So I would like young women to marry again and have children. They should care for their homes. They should do nothing that would make the enemy say wrong things about them."},{"num":15,"verse":"Some have already turned away to follow Satan."},{"num":16,"verse":"Do any Christians have in their families women whose husbands are dead? If they do, they should help them. The church people should not have to care for them.

At least do this for those who work hard in speaking and teaching."},{"num":18,"verse":"The holy writings say, `You may not tie the mouth of a cow when it is walking on the grain to beat it out.'
