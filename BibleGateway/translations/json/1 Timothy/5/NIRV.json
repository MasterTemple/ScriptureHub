Be completely pure in the way you treat them."},{"num":3,"verse":"Take care of the widows who really need help. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But suppose a widow has children or grandchildren. They should first learn to put their faith into practice. They should care for their own family. In that way they will pay back their parents and grandparents. That pleases God. "},{"num":5,"verse":"A widow who really needs help and is left all alone puts her hope in God. Night and day she keeps on praying. Night and day she asks God for help. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But a widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she is still living. "},{"num":7,"verse":"Give these instructions to the people. Then no one can be blamed. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Everyone should provide for their own relatives. Most of all, everyone should take care of their own family. If they don’t, they have left the faith.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"Besides, they get into the habit of having nothing to do. They go around from house to house. They waste their time. They also bother other people and say things that make no sense. They shouldn’t say those things. "},{"num":14,"verse":"So here is the advice I give to younger widows. Get married. Have children.
