"},{"num":4,"verse":"But if they have children or grandchildren, these are the ones who should take the responsibility, for kindness should begin at home, supporting needy parents. This is something that pleases God very much."},{"num":5,"verse":"The church should care for widows who are poor and alone in the world if they are looking to God for his help and spending much time in prayer; "},{"num":6,"verse":"but not if they are spending their time running around gossiping, seeking only pleasure and thus ruining their souls. "},{"num":7,"verse":"This should be your church rule so that the Christians will know and do what is right."},{"num":8,"verse":"But anyone who won’t care for his own relatives when they need help, especially those living in his own family, has no right to say he is a Christian.
