[The horsemen] stumble over the corpses!"},{"num":4,"verse":"All because of the multitude of the harlotries [of Nineveh], the well-favored harlot, the mistress of deadly charms who betrays and sells nations through her whoredoms [idolatry] and peoples through her enchantments."},{"num":5,"verse":"Behold, I am against you, says the Lord of hosts, and I will lift up your skirts over your face, and I will let the nations look on your nakedness [O Nineveh] and the kingdoms on your shame."},{"num":6,"verse":"I will cast abominable things at you and make you filthy, treat you with contempt, and make you a gazingstock."},{"num":7,"verse":"And all who look on you will shrink and flee from you and say, Nineveh is laid waste; who will pity and bemoan her?
