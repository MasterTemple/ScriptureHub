"},{"num":2,"verse":"For the king, his officials and the entire Yerushalayim community had agreed to keep the Pesach in the second month. "},{"num":3,"verse":"They had not been able to observe it at the proper time because the cohanim had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number; also the people had not assembled in Yerushalayim. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The idea had seemed right to the king and to the whole community; "},{"num":5,"verse":"so they issued a decree that it should be proclaimed throughout all Isra’el, from Be’er-Sheva to Dan, that they should come to keep the Pesach to Adonai the God of Isra’el at Yerushalayim; for only a few had been observing it as prescribed."},{"num":6,"verse":"So runners went with the letters from the king and his officers throughout all Isra’el and Y’hudah. They conveyed the king’s order: “People of Isra’el! Turn back to Adonai, the God of Avraham, Yitz’chak and Ya‘akov! Then he will return to those of you who remain, who escaped capture by the kings of Ashur.
