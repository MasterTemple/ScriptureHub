[{"header":"The Great Passover Celebration"},{"num":30,"verse":"Hezekiah sent messengers to all Israel and Judah. He also wrote letters inviting Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the House of the Lord at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover for the Lord, the God of Israel. "},{"num":2,"verse":"The king, his officials, and the whole assembly in Jerusalem had made plans to celebrate the Passover in the second month. "},{"num":3,"verse":"They were not able to celebrate it at its proper time, because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number, and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem."},{"num":4,"verse":"The plan seemed right in the eyes of the king and in the eyes of the whole assembly. "},{"num":5,"verse":"So they decided to issue a proclamation throughout Israel from Beersheba to Dan to come to observe the Passover for the Lord, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem, because they had not been celebrating it with large numbers of people as had been commanded. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Runners were sent out with letters from the hand of the king and from his officials to all Israel and Judah. Because of the command of the king, they made the following announcement:"},{"num":10,"verse":"The runners went from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and even as far as Zebulun, but people laughed at them and ridiculed them.

They took away all the altars for burning incense and threw them into the Kidron Valley."},{"num":15,"verse":"They slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites had been put to shame, so they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the House of the Lord. "},{"num":16,"verse":"They took up their positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses, the man of God. The priests splashed the blood, which was given to them by the Levites, against the altar.
