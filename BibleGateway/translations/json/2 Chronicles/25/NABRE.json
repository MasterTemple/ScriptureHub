His mother’s name was Jehoaddan, from Jerusalem. "},{"num":2,"verse":"He did what was right in the Lord’s sight, though not wholeheartedly. "},{"num":3,"verse":"When he had the kingdom firmly in hand, he struck down the officials who had struck down the king, his father. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But their children he did not put to death, for he acted according to what is written in the law, in the Book of Moses, which the Lord commanded: “Parents shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their parents; they shall each die for their own sin.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"Amaziah gathered Judah and placed them, out of all Judah and Benjamin according to their ancestral houses, under leaders of thousands and of hundreds. When he made a count of those twenty years old and over, he found that there were three hundred thousand picked men fit for war, capable of handling lance and shield. "},{"num":6,"verse":"He also hired a hundred thousand valiant warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But a man of God came to him and said: “O king, let not the army of Israel go with you, for the Lord is not with Israel—with any Ephraimite.

They struck down three thousand of the inhabitants and carried off much plunder."},{"num":14,"verse":"Amaziah’s Apostasy. When Amaziah returned from his conquest of the Edomites he brought back with him the gods of the people of Seir. He set these up as his own gods; he bowed down before them and offered sacrifice to them.

Stop! Why should you have to be killed?” Therefore the prophet stopped.
