I am only reminding you of the old command. It’s a word you already know, a word that has existed from the beginning. "},{"num":8,"verse":"However, in another sense, I am writing a new command for you. The new command is the truth that He lived; and now you are living it, too, because the darkness is fading and the true light is already shining among you."},{"num":9,"verse":"Anyone who says, “I live in the light,” but hates his brother or sister is still living in the shadows.
