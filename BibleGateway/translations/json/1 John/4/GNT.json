The spirit that he has is from the Enemy of Christ; you heard that it would come, and now it is here in the world already."},{"num":4,"verse":"But you belong to God, my children, and have defeated the false prophets, because the Spirit who is in you is more powerful than the spirit in those who belong to the world.
