The priests from the shrines who are making offerings on you, he will sacrifice—on you! Human bones burned on you!’” At the same time he announced a sign: “This is the proof  gives—the Altar will split into pieces and the holy offerings spill into the dirt.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When the king heard the message the holy man preached against the Altar at Bethel, he reached out to grab him, yelling, “Arrest him!” But his arm was paralyzed and hung useless.

Pray to your  for the healing of my arm.” The holy man prayed for him and the king’s arm was healed—as good as new!"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then the king invited the holy man, “Join me for a meal; I have a gift for you.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The holy man told the king, “Not on your life! You couldn’t pay me enough to get me to sit down with you at a meal in this place. I’m here under ’s orders, and he commanded, ‘Don’t eat a crumb, don’t drink a drop, and don’t go back the way you came.’” Then he left by a different road than the one on which he had walked to Bethel."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"There was an old prophet who lived in Bethel. His sons came and told him the story of what the holy man had done that day in Bethel, told him everything that had happened and what the holy man had said to the king."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Their father said, “Which way did he go?” His sons pointed out the road that the holy man from Judah had taken."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He told his sons, “Saddle my donkey.” When they had saddled it, he got on and rode after the holy man.

He confronted the holy man who had come from Judah: “’s word to you: You disobeyed ’s command; you didn’t keep the strict orders your  gave you; you came back and sat down to a good meal in the very place  told you, ‘Don’t eat a crumb; don’t drink a drop.’ For that you’re going to die far from home and not be buried in your ancestral tomb.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When the meal was over, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him. Down the road a way, a lion met him and killed him. His corpse lay crumpled on the road, the lion on one side and the donkey on the other.
