He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet."},{"num":6,"verse":"Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace."},{"num":7,"verse":"“But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table.
