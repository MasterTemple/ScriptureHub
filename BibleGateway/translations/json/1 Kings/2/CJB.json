"},{"num":4,"verse":"If you do, Adonai will fulfill what he promised me when he said, ‘If your children pay attention to how they live, conducting themselves before me honestly with all their heart and being, you will never lack a man on the throne of Isra’el.’"},{"num":5,"verse":"“Moreover, you are aware of what Yo’av the son of Tz’ruyah did to me, that is, what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Isra’el, Avner the son of Ner and ‘Amasa the son of Yeter — he killed them, shedding the blood of war in peacetime, putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and the shoes on his feet. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Therefore, act according to your wisdom; don’t let his gray head go down to the grave in peace."},{"num":7,"verse":"“But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gil‘adi. Include them with those who eat at your table, because they came and stood with me when I was fleeing from Avshalom your brother."},{"num":8,"verse":"“Finally, you have with you Shim‘i the son of Gera the Binyamini, from Bachurim. He laid a terrible curse on me when I was on my way to Machanayim; but he came down to meet me at the Yarden; so I swore to him by Adonai that I would not have him put to death with the sword.

No matter; the kingdom has turned around and become my brother’s, because Adonai gave it to him. "},{"num":16,"verse":"But now I ask one favor of you; don’t deny me.” “Go on,” she said. "},{"num":17,"verse":"He said, “Please speak to Shlomo the king — for he won’t say ‘No’ to you — and ask him to give me Avishag the Shunamit as my wife.” "},{"num":18,"verse":"Bat-Sheva said, “All right, I will speak to the king on your behalf.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"So Bat-Sheva went to King Shlomo to speak to him on behalf of Adoniyah.

Ask the kingdom for him too! After all, he’s my older brother! Yes, for him, and for Evyatar the cohen and for Yo’av the son of Tz’ruyah!” "},{"num":23,"verse":"Then King Shlomo swore by Adonai, “May God do terrible things to me and worse if Adoniyah hasn’t condemned himself to death with this request!

You deserve to die; but I won’t put you to death just now; since you did carry the ark of Adonai Elohim before David my father; and you suffered together with my father in everything he suffered.” "},{"num":27,"verse":"So Shlomo forced Evyatar out of his task as cohen to Adonai, so that what Adonai had said in Shiloh about the family of ‘Eli might be fulfilled."},{"num":28,"verse":"When the news came to Yo’av, he fled to the tent of Adonai and took hold of the horns of the altar; for Yo’av had given his support to Adoniyah, even though he had not supported Avshalom.

In this way you will take away from me and my father’s family the blood which Yo’av shed for no reason. "},{"num":32,"verse":"Adonai will bring his blood back on his own head, because he struck down two men more righteous and better than he — he killed them with the sword without my father David’s awareness: Avner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Isra’el, and ‘Amasa the son of Yeter, commander of the army of Y’hudah. "},{"num":33,"verse":"In this way their blood will return on the head of Yo’av and his descendants forever; but for David, his descendants, his family and his throne there will be peace forever from Adonai.” "},{"num":34,"verse":"So B’nayah the son of Y’hoyada went up, struck him down and killed him; he was buried in his own house in the desert.
