Be strong and be a man."},{"num":3,"verse":"Guard what is owed to the Lord your God, walking in his ways and observing his laws, his commands, his judgments, and his testimonies, just as it is written in the Instruction from Moses. In this way you will succeed in whatever you do and wherever you go."},{"num":4,"verse":"So also the Lord will confirm the word he spoke to me: ‘If your children will take care to walk before me faithfully, with all their heart and all their being, then one of your own children will never fail to be on the throne of Israel.’"},{"num":5,"verse":"You should know what Joab, Zeruiah’s son, has done to me and what he did to the two generals of Israel, Abner, Ner’s son, and Amasa, Jether’s son. He murdered them, spilling blood at peacetime and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet."},{"num":6,"verse":"So act wisely: Don’t allow him to die a peaceful death."},{"num":7,"verse":"As for Barzillai’s sons from Gilead, show them kindness. Let them eat with you. When I was running away from your brother Absalom, they came to me."},{"num":8,"verse":"Now as for this Shimei, Gera’s son—a Benjaminite from Bahurim—who is with you, he cursed me viciously when I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord, ‘Surely I won’t execute you with the sword.’"},{"num":9,"verse":"But you don’t need to excuse him. You are wise and know what to do to him. Give him a violent death.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Then David lay down with his ancestors and was buried in David’s City."},{"num":11,"verse":"He ruled over Israel forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem."},{"header":"Solomon secures his throne"},{"num":12,"verse":"Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his royal power was well established."},{"num":13,"verse":"Adonijah, Haggith’s son, went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. She said, “Are you coming in peace?”"},{"num":14,"verse":"I have something to say to you.”"},{"num":15,"verse":"He said, “You know how the kingdom was mine. All Israel had appointed me as their king. Then suddenly the kingdom went to my brother as the Lord willed."},{"num":16,"verse":"Now I have just one request of you. Don’t refuse me!”"},{"num":17,"verse":"Adonijah continued, “Ask King Solomon to let me marry Abishag from Shunem—he won’t refuse you.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"Bathsheba said, “Okay; I’ll speak to the king for you.”"},{"num":19,"verse":"So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk with him about Adonijah. The king stood up to meet her and bowed low to her. Then he returned to his throne and had a throne set up for the queen mother. She sat to his right."},{"num":20,"verse":"She said, “I have just one small request for you. Don’t refuse me.”"},{"num":21,"verse":"“Let Abishag from Shunem be married to your brother Adonijah,” she said."},{"num":22,"verse":"King Solomon replied to his mother, “Why ask only for Abishag from Shunem for Adonijah? Why not ask for the entire kingdom for him? After all, he is my older brother and has the support of Abiathar the priest and Joab, Zeruiah’s son.”"},{"num":23,"verse":"King Solomon swore by the Lord, “May God do to me as he sees fit! Adonijah has made this request at the cost of his life!"},{"num":24,"verse":"Now, as surely as the Lord lives—the one who supported me, put me on the throne of my father David, and provided a royal house for me exactly as he promised—Adonijah will be executed today.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"So King Solomon sent Benaiah, Jehoiada’s son. He attacked Adonijah, and Adonijah died."},{"num":26,"verse":"The king said to the priest Abiathar, “Go to your fields at Anathoth, because you are a condemned man. However, I won’t kill you today because you carried the Lord’s chest in front of my father David and because you shared in all my father’s sufferings.”"},{"num":27,"verse":"So Solomon expelled Abiathar from the Lord’s priesthood in order to fulfill the Lord’s word that was spoken against Eli’s family at Shiloh."},{"num":28,"verse":"Now the news reached Joab because he had supported Adonijah, though he hadn’t supported Absalom. Joab ran to the Lord’s tent and grabbed the horns of the altar."},{"num":29,"verse":"King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the Lord’s tent and was now beside the altar. So Solomon sent Benaiah, Jehoiada’s son, instructing him, “Go. Attack Joab!”"},{"num":30,"verse":"Benaiah came to the Lord’s tent and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’”"},{"num":31,"verse":"The king said to him, “Do as he said. Attack him and then bury him. In doing this, you will remove from me and from my father’s royal house the guilt over the innocent blood that Joab shed."},{"num":32,"verse":"May the Lord return that bloodguilt back on his own head for attacking the two men who were better and more righteous than he was.

But my father David didn’t know about it."},{"num":33,"verse":"May the bloodguilt for their deaths return on Joab’s head and on the head of his family line forever. But may the Lord’s peace be on David, his family, and his royal house forever.”"},{"num":34,"verse":"So Benaiah, Jehoiada’s son, went and attacked Joab and killed him."},{"num":35,"verse":"In his place, the king gave leadership of the army to Benaiah, Jehoiada’s son. The king put the priest Zadok in Abiathar’s position."},{"num":36,"verse":"Then he sent for Shimei and said, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and stay in the city.
