"},{"num":6,"verse":"Now I will send my servants to you tomorrow at this time, and they shall search your palace and the houses of your courtiers. Whatever is valuable in your eyes, they shall seize in their hand and take it away.”"},{"num":7,"verse":"Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said, “Please know and see how this man is bent on evil! For he sent someone to me for my wives, my children, my silver and my gold, and I didn’t refuse him.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"All the elders and all the people said to him, “Don’t listen to him or consent.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, “Tell my lord the king: All that you sent to your servant at first, I will do, but this thing I cannot do,” The messengers departed and reported to him."},{"num":10,"verse":"Then Ben-Hadad sent word to him again saying, “May the gods do so to me and even more, if the dust of Samaria will suffice for handfuls for all the people at my feet.”"},{"num":11,"verse":"The king of Israel answered and said, “Tell him: ‘Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"On hearing this reply—while he and the other kings were drinking in the booths—he said to his servants, “Take your positions.” So they stationed themselves against the city."},{"num":13,"verse":"Then behold, a prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and said, “Thus says Adonai: Have you seen all this great multitude?

"},{"num":24,"verse":"So this is what you should do: remove the kings, each from his post, and appoint governors in their place. "},{"num":25,"verse":"Then muster an army like the army that you lost—horse for horse and chariot for chariot—and let’s fight against them in the plain, and surely we’ll be stronger than them!” He listened to their advice and acted accordingly."},{"num":26,"verse":"It came about at the turn of the year that Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and marched up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. "},{"num":27,"verse":"Now the children of Israel were mustered, given provisions, and marched against them. But when the children of Israel encamped before them, they looked like two little flocks of goats while the Arameans covered the land."},{"num":28,"verse":"Then a man of God approached the king of Israel and spoke to him saying, “Thus says Adonai: Because the Arameans have said, ‘Adonai is a God of the mountains, but He is not a God of the valleys,’ therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Adonai.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"So they encamped one over against the other seven days. On the seventh day the battle was joined, and the children of Israel struck down 100,000 of the Aramean foot soldiers in a single day.

"},{"num":31,"verse":"His officials said to him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let’s put sackcloth on our loins and ropes on our heads, and surrender to the king of Israel.
