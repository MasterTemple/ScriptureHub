Head east and hide out at the Kerith Ravine on the other side of the Jordan River. You can drink fresh water from the brook; I’ve ordered the ravens to feed you.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Elijah obeyed ’s orders. He went and camped in the Kerith canyon on the other side of the Jordan. And sure enough, ravens brought him his meals, both breakfast and supper, and he drank from the brook."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Eventually the brook dried up because of the drought. Then  spoke to him: “Get up and go to Zarephath in Sidon and live there.
