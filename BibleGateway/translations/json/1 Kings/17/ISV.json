"},{"num":4,"verse":"You will be able to drink from that brook, and I’ve commanded some crows to sustain you there.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So Elijah left and did exactly what the Lord had told him to do—he went to live near the Wadi Cherith, where it enters the Jordan River. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Crows would bring him bread and meat both in the morning and in the evening, and he would drink from the brook.
