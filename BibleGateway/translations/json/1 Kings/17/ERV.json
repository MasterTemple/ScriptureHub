[{"header":"Elijah and the Time Without Rain"},{"num":17,"verse":"Elijah was a prophet from the town of Tishbe in Gilead. He said to King Ahab, “I serve the Lord, the God of Israel.

Hide near Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan River."},{"num":4,"verse":"You can get your water from that stream, and I have commanded ravens to bring food to you there.”"},{"num":5,"verse":"So Elijah did what the Lord told him to do. He went to live near Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan River."},{"num":6,"verse":"Ravens brought Elijah food every morning and every evening, and he drank water from the stream."},{"num":7,"verse":"There was no rain, so after a while the stream became dry."},{"num":8,"verse":"Then the Lord said to Elijah,"},{"num":9,"verse":"“Go to Zarephath in Sidon and stay there. There is a widow there that I commanded to take care of you.”"},{"num":10,"verse":"So Elijah went to Zarephath. He went to the town gate and saw a woman there gathering wood for a fire. She was a widow. Elijah said to her, “Would you bring me a small cup of water to drink?”"},{"num":11,"verse":"As she was going to get the water, Elijah said, “Bring me a piece of bread too, please.”"},{"num":12,"verse":"The woman answered, “I promise you, before the Lord your God, that I have nothing but a handful of flour in a jar and a little bit of olive oil in a jug. I came here to gather a few pieces of wood for a fire to cook our last meal. My son and I will eat it and then die from hunger.”"},{"num":13,"verse":"Elijah said to the woman, “Don’t worry. Go home and cook your food as you said. But first make a small piece of bread from the flour that you have and bring it to me.
