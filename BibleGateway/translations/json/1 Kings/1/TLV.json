"},{"num":4,"verse":"The girl was very beautiful. So she became the king’s nurse and served him, but the king was not intimate with her."},{"num":5,"verse":"Now Adonijah son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: “I’ll be king!” So he prepared for himself chariots, horsemen and 50 men to run before him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"His father had not scolded him at any time by asking: “Why have you behaved this way?” He was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom."},{"num":7,"verse":"So he conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the kohen.
