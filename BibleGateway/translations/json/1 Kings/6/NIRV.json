[{"header":"Solomon Builds the Temple"},{"num":6,"verse":"Solomon began to build the temple of the Lord. It was 480 years after the Israelites came out of Egypt.

On the second floor they were nine feet wide. And on the third floor they were ten and a half feet wide. Solomon made the walls of the temple thinner as they went up floor by floor. The result was ledges along the walls. So the floor beams of the side rooms rested on the ledges. The beams didn’t go into the temple walls."},{"num":7,"verse":"All the stones used for building the temple were shaped where they were cut. So hammers, chisels and other iron tools couldn’t be heard where the temple was being built."},{"num":8,"verse":"The entrance to the first floor was on the south side of the temple. A stairway led up to the second floor. From there it went on up to the third floor. "},{"num":9,"verse":"So Solomon built the temple and finished it. He made its roof out of beams and cedar boards.

The wing tip of one cherub touched one wall. The wing tip of the other touched the other wall. The tips of their wings touched each other in the middle of the room. "},{"num":28,"verse":"Solomon covered the cherubim with gold."},{"num":29,"verse":"On the walls all around the temple he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers. He carved them on the walls of the Most Holy Room and the main hall. "},{"num":30,"verse":"He also covered the floors of those two rooms with gold."},{"num":31,"verse":"For the entrance to the Most Holy Room he made two doors out of olive wood. Each door was one-fifth of the width of the Most Holy Room. "},{"num":32,"verse":"On the two olive wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers. He covered the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold. "},{"num":33,"verse":"In the same way he made olive wood doorposts for the entrance to the main hall.
