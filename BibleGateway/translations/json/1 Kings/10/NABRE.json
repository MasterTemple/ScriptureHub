She came to Solomon and spoke to him about everything that she had on her mind. "},{"num":3,"verse":"King Solomon explained everything she asked about, and there was nothing so obscure that the king could not explain it to her. "},{"num":4,"verse":"When the queen of Sheba witnessed Solomon’s great wisdom, the house he had built, "},{"num":5,"verse":"the food at his table, the seating of his ministers, the attendance and dress of his waiters, his servers, and the burnt offerings he offered in the house of the Lord, it took her breath away.

"},{"num":7,"verse":"“I did not believe the report until I came and saw with my own eyes that not even the half had been told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report I heard.
