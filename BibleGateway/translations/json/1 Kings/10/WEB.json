[{"num":10,"verse":"When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning Yahweh’s name, she came to test him with hard questions. "},{"num":2,"verse":"She came to Jerusalem with a very great caravan, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was in her heart. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Solomon answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from the king which he didn’t tell her. "},{"num":4,"verse":"When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, "},{"num":5,"verse":"the food of his table, the sitting of his servants, the attendance of his officials, their clothing, his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to Yahweh’s house; there was no more spirit in her. "},{"num":6,"verse":"She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom. "},{"num":7,"verse":"However I didn’t believe the words until I came and my eyes had seen it. Behold, not even half was told me! Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, who hear your wisdom. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Blessed is Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, in addition to that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold, "},{"num":15,"verse":"in addition to that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people, and of the governors of the country. "},{"num":16,"verse":"King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.
