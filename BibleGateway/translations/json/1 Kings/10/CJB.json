"},{"num":2,"verse":"She arrived in Yerushalayim accompanied by a very great retinue, including camels bearing spices and gold in great abundance, and precious stones. When she appeared before Shlomo she spoke with him about everything on her heart, "},{"num":3,"verse":"and Shlomo answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from the king that he could not explain to her. "},{"num":4,"verse":"After the queen of Sh’va had seen all Shlomo’s wisdom, the palace he had built, "},{"num":5,"verse":"the food at his table, the manner of seating his officials, the manner in which his staff served him, how they were dressed, his personal servants and his burnt offering which he offered in the house of Adonai, it left her breathless. "},{"num":6,"verse":"She said to the king, “What I heard in my own country about your deeds and your wisdom is true, "},{"num":7,"verse":"but I couldn’t believe the report until I came and saw for myself. Actually, they didn’t tell me even the half of it — your wisdom and prosperity surpass the reports I heard.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"King Shlomo made 200 large shields of hammered gold; fifteen pounds of gold went into one shield. "},{"num":17,"verse":"He made 300 more shields of hammered gold, with three-and-three-quarters pounds going into one shield; the king put these in the House of the L’vanon Forest."},{"num":18,"verse":"The king also made a large throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold. "},{"num":19,"verse":"The throne had six steps, a back with a rounded top, arms on either side of the seat, two lions standing beside the arms, "},{"num":20,"verse":"and twelve more lions standing on each side of the six steps. Nothing like it had ever been made in any kingdom."},{"num":21,"verse":"All King Shlomo’s drinking vessels were of gold; and all the utensils in the House of the L’vanon Forest were of pure gold; none was of silver, for in Shlomo’s time it was regarded as having little value.
