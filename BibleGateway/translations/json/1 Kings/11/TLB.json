[{"num":11,"verse":"King Solomon married many other girls besides the Egyptian princess. Many of them came from nations where idols were worshiped—Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and from the Hittites—"},{"num":2,"verse":"even though the Lord had clearly instructed his people not to marry into those nations, because the women they married would get them started worshiping their gods. Yet Solomon did it anyway. "},{"num":3,"verse":"He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines; and sure enough, they turned his heart away from the Lord, "},{"num":4,"verse":"especially in his old age. They encouraged him to worship their gods instead of trusting completely in the Lord as his father David had done. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Milcom, the horrible god of the Ammonites. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Thus Solomon did what was clearly wrong and refused to follow the Lord as his father David did. "},{"num":7,"verse":"He even built a temple on the Mount of Olives, across the valley from Jerusalem, for Chemosh, the depraved god of Moab, and another for Molech, the unutterably vile god of the Ammonites. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Solomon built temples for these foreign wives to use for burning incense and sacrificing to their gods."},{"num":9,"verse":"Jehovah was very angry with Solomon about this, for now Solomon was no longer interested in the Lord God of Israel who had appeared to him twice to warn him specifically against worshiping other gods. But he hadn’t listened, "},{"num":11,"verse":"so now the Lord said to him, “Since you have not kept our agreement and have not obeyed my laws, I will tear the kingdom away from you and your family and give it to someone else. "},{"num":12,"verse":"However, for the sake of your father David, I won’t do this while you are still alive. I will take the kingdom away from your son. And even so I will let him be king of one tribe, for David’s sake and for the sake of Jerusalem, my chosen city.”"},{"num":14,"verse":"So the Lord caused Hadad the Edomite to grow in power. And Solomon became apprehensive, for Hadad was a member of the royal family of Edom. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Years before, when David had been in Edom with Joab to arrange for the burial of some Israeli soldiers who had died in battle, the Israeli army had killed nearly every male in the entire country. "},{"num":16,"verse":"It took six months to accomplish this, but they finally killed all except Hadad and a few royal officials who took him to Egypt (he was a very small child at the time). They slipped out of Midian and went to Paran, where others joined them and accompanied them to Egypt, and Pharaoh had given them homes and food."},{"num":19,"verse":"Hadad became one of Pharaoh’s closest friends, and he gave him a wife—the sister of Queen Tahpenes.

"},{"num":21,"verse":"When Hadad, there in Egypt, heard that David and Joab were both dead, he asked Pharaoh for permission to return to Edom."},{"num":22,"verse":"“Why?” Pharaoh asked him. “What do you lack here? How have we disappointed you?”"},{"num":23,"verse":"Another of Solomon’s enemies whom God raised to power was Rezon, one of the officials of King Hadadezer of Zobah who had deserted his post and fled the country.

"},{"num":27,"verse":"Here is the story of his rebellion: Solomon was rebuilding Fort Millo, repairing the walls of this city his father had built. Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw how industrious he was, he put him in charge of his labor battalions from the tribe of Joseph."},{"num":29,"verse":"One day as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh (who had put on a new robe for the occasion) met him and called him aside to talk to him. And as the two of them were alone in the field, "},{"num":30,"verse":"Ahijah tore his new robe into twelve parts "},{"num":31,"verse":"and said to Jeroboam, “Take ten of these pieces, for the Lord God of Israel says, ‘I will tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and give ten of the tribes to you! "},{"num":32,"verse":"But I will leave him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen above all the other cities of Israel. "},{"num":33,"verse":"For Solomon has forsaken me and worships Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians; and Chemosh, the god of Moab; and Milcom, the god of the Ammonites. He has not followed my paths and has not done what I consider right; he has not kept my laws and instructions as his father David did.
