[{"header":"Elijah’s Message to Ahab"},{"num":18,"verse":"And it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the earth.”"},{"num":2,"verse":"So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab; and there was a severe famine in Samaria. "},{"num":3,"verse":"And Ahab had called Obadiah, who was in charge of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly. "},{"num":4,"verse":"For so it was, while Jezebel massacred the prophets of the Lord, that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed them with bread and water.) "},{"num":5,"verse":"And Ahab had said to Obadiah, “Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to kill any livestock.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"So they divided the land between them to explore it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."},{"num":7,"verse":"Now as Obadiah was on his way, suddenly Elijah met him; and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, “Is that you, my lord Elijah?”"},{"num":8,"verse":"And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your master, ‘Elijah is here.’ ”"},{"num":9,"verse":"So he said, “How have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? "},{"num":10,"verse":"As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you; and when they said, ‘He is not here,’ he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they could not find you.

But I your servant have feared the Lord from my youth. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord, how I hid one hundred men of the Lord’s prophets, fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water?

"},{"num":19,"verse":"Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”"},{"header":"Elijah’s Mount Carmel Victory"},{"num":20,"verse":"So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel. "},{"num":21,"verse":"And Elijah came to all the people, and said, “How long will you falter between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.” But the people answered him not a word. "},{"num":22,"verse":"Then Elijah said to the people, “I alone am left a prophet of the Lord; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men. "},{"num":23,"verse":"Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it. "},{"num":24,"verse":"Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.”"},{"num":25,"verse":"Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.”"},{"num":26,"verse":"So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, “O Baal, hear us!” But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made."},{"num":27,"verse":"And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, “Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.” "},{"num":28,"verse":"So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them. "},{"num":29,"verse":"And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention."},{"num":30,"verse":"Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. "},{"num":31,"verse":"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, “Israel shall be your name.” "},{"num":32,"verse":"Then with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed. "},{"num":33,"verse":"And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, “Fill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.” "},{"num":34,"verse":"Then he said, “Do it a second time,” and they did it a second time; and he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time. "},{"num":35,"verse":"So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water."},{"num":36,"verse":"And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, “Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word. "},{"num":37,"verse":"Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that You are the Lord God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You again.”"},{"num":38,"verse":"Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.

The Lord, He is God!”"},{"num":40,"verse":"And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!” So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and executed them there."},{"header":"The Drought Ends"},{"num":41,"verse":"Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.” "},{"num":42,"verse":"So Ahab went up to eat and drink.
