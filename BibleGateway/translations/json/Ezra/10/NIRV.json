[{"header":"The People Admit They Have Sinned"},{"num":10,"verse":"Ezra was praying and admitting to God that his people had sinned.

"},{"num":2,"verse":"Shekaniah spoke to Ezra. Shekaniah was the son of Jehiel. He belonged to the family line of Elam. Shekaniah said, “We haven’t been faithful to our God. We’ve married women from the nations around us. In spite of that, there is still hope for Israel. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So let’s make a covenant in front of our God. Let’s promise to send away all these women and their children. That’s what you have advised us to do. Those who respect our God’s commands have given us the same advice. We want to do what the Law says. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Get up, Ezra. This matter is in your hands. Do what you need to. We will be behind you all the way.

He made them promise they would do what Shekaniah had suggested. And they made that promise. "},{"num":6,"verse":"Then Ezra left the house of God. He went to Jehohanan’s room. Jehohanan was the son of Eliashib. While Ezra was there, he didn’t eat any food. He didn’t drink any water. That’s because he was filled with sadness.
