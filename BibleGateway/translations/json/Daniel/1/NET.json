He brought them to the land of Babylonia to the temple of his god and put the vessels in the treasury of his god."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"The king commanded Ashpenaz, who was in charge of his court officials, to choose some of the Israelites who were of royal and noble descent—"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"young men in whom there was no physical defect and who were handsome, well versed in all kinds of wisdom, well educated and having keen insight, and who were capable of entering the king’s royal service—and to teach them the literature and language of the Babylonians. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So the king assigned them a daily ration from his royal delicacies and from the wine he himself drank. They were to be trained for the next three years.
