Ashpenaz was the chief of Nebuchadnezzar’s court officials. The king told him to bring him some of the Israelites. The king wanted them to serve him in his court. He wanted nobles and men from the royal family. "},{"num":4,"verse":"He was looking for young men who were healthy and handsome. They had to be able to learn anything. They had to be well educated.

"},{"num":10,"verse":"But the official refused to do what Daniel asked for. He said, “I’m afraid of the king. He is my master. He has decided what you and your three friends must eat and drink.
