[{"header":"Daniel Taken to Babylon"},{"num":1,"verse":"During the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah [605 bc], Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon [ruled 605–562 bc] came to Jerusalem and ·surrounded it with his army [besieged/pressed it]. "},{"num":2,"verse":"The Lord ·allowed Nebuchadnezzar to capture Jehoiakim king of Judah [gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand; God was in control, not Nebuchadnezzar]. Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the ·things [articles; utensils; cups, forks, and other items used in ritual; 5:2–4; Ex. 27:9; 30:27; 31:8–9; Ezra 1:9–11] from the ·Temple [house] of God, which he carried to ·Babylonia [the land of Shinar] and put in the ·temple [house of the treasury] of his ·gods [or god; probably Marduk, the chief god of Babylon]."},{"num":3,"verse":"Then King Nebuchadnezzar ordered Ashpenaz, ·his chief officer [or the chief of his eunuchs], to bring some of the ·men of Judah into his palace.
