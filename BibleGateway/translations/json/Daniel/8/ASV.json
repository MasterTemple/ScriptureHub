[{"num":8,"verse":"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. "},{"num":2,"verse":"And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai. "},{"num":3,"verse":"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself."},{"num":5,"verse":"And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. "},{"num":8,"verse":"And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven."},{"num":9,"verse":"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land. "},{"num":10,"verse":"And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual burnt-offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. "},{"num":12,"verse":"And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? "},{"num":14,"verse":"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."},{"num":15,"verse":"And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. "},{"num":16,"verse":"And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright. "},{"num":19,"verse":"And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. "},{"num":20,"verse":"The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. "},{"num":21,"verse":"And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. "},{"num":22,"verse":"And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. "},{"num":23,"verse":"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. "},{"num":24,"verse":"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do his pleasure; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people. "},{"num":25,"verse":"And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in their security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. "},{"num":26,"verse":"And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come. "},{"num":27,"verse":"And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it."}]
