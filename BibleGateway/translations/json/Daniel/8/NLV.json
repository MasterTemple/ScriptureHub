"},{"num":3,"verse":"Then I looked up and saw a ram with two horns standing by the river. The two horns were long, but one was longer than the other. And the longer one came up last. "},{"num":4,"verse":"I saw the ram pushing to the west, to the north, and to the south. No other animals could stop him or be saved from his power. He did as he pleased and made himself great."},{"num":5,"verse":"While I was watching, a male goat came from the west across the whole earth without touching the ground.

"},{"num":13,"verse":"Then I heard a holy one speaking. And another holy one said to the one that spoke, “How long will it take for the things seen in the dream to happen?
