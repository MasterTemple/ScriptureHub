As I watched, its wings were pulled off, and it was left standing with its two hind feet on the ground, like a human being. And it was given a human mind."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then I saw a second beast, and it looked like a bear. It was rearing up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And I heard a voice saying to it, “Get up! Devour the flesh of many people!”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then the third of these strange beasts appeared, and it looked like a leopard. It had four bird’s wings on its back, and it had four heads. Great authority was given to this beast."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then in my vision that night, I saw a fourth beast—terrifying, dreadful, and very strong. It devoured and crushed its victims with huge iron teeth and trampled their remains beneath its feet. It was different from any of the other beasts, and it had ten horns."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"As I was looking at the horns, suddenly another small horn appeared among them. Three of the first horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it. This little horn had eyes like human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"I continued to watch because I could hear the little horn’s boastful speech.

He explained it to me like this:"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"“These four huge beasts represent four kingdoms that will arise from the earth."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But in the end, the holy people of the Most High will be given the kingdom, and they will rule forever and ever.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, the one so different from the others and so terrifying. It had devoured and crushed its victims with iron teeth and bronze claws, trampling their remains beneath its feet."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"I also asked about the ten horns on the fourth beast’s head and the little horn that came up afterward and destroyed three of the other horns.

Then another king will arise, different from the other ten, who will subdue three of them."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"He will defy the Most High and oppress the holy people of the Most High. He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws, and they will be placed under his control for a time, times, and half a time."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"“But then the court will pass judgment, and all his power will be taken away and completely destroyed."}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Then the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will last forever, and all rulers will serve and obey him.”"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"That was the end of the vision. I, Daniel, was terrified by my thoughts and my face was pale with fear, but I kept these things to myself."}]]
