[{"header":"Chapter 7"},{"num":1,"verse":"The Beasts and the Judgment. In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, as Daniel lay in bed he had a dream, visions in his head. Then he wrote down the dream; the account began: "},{"num":2,"verse":"In the vision I saw during the night, suddenly the four winds of heaven stirred up the great sea, "},{"num":3,"verse":"from which emerged four immense beasts, each different from the others. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The first was like a lion, but with eagle’s wings. While I watched, the wings were plucked; it was raised from the ground to stand on two feet like a human being, and given a human mind. "},{"num":5,"verse":"The second beast was like a bear; it was raised up on one side, and among the teeth in its mouth were three tusks. It was given the order, “Arise, devour much flesh.” "},{"num":6,"verse":"After this I looked and saw another beast, like a leopard; on its back were four wings like those of a bird, and it had four heads. To this beast dominion was given. "},{"num":7,"verse":"After this, in the visions of the night I saw a fourth beast, terrifying, horrible, and of extraordinary strength; it had great iron teeth with which it devoured and crushed, and it trampled with its feet what was left. It differed from the beasts that preceded it. It had ten horns. "},{"num":8,"verse":"I was considering the ten horns it had, when suddenly another, a little horn, sprang out of their midst, and three of the previous horns were torn away to make room for it. This horn had eyes like human eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogantly. "},{"num":9,"verse":"As I watched,"},{"num":11,"verse":"I watched, then, from the first of the arrogant words which the horn spoke, until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the burning fire. "},{"num":12,"verse":"As for the other beasts, their dominion was taken away, but they were granted a prolongation of life for a time and a season. "},{"num":13,"verse":"As the visions during the night continued, I saw coming with the clouds of heaven"},{"num":15,"verse":"Because of this, my spirit was anguished and I, Daniel, was terrified by my visions.
