In fact, the king intended to appoint him over the entire kingdom.

But they were unable to find any such damaging evidence, because he was trustworthy and guilty of no negligence or corruption.

For the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human other than you, O king, should be thrown into a den of lions.
