"},{"num":3,"verse":"Daniel soon showed that he could do better work than the other supervisors or the governors. Because he was so outstanding, the king considered putting him in charge of the whole empire. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Then the other supervisors and the governors tried to find something wrong with the way Daniel administered the empire, but they couldn't, because Daniel was reliable and did not do anything wrong or dishonest. "},{"num":5,"verse":"They said to each other, “We are not going to find anything of which to accuse Daniel unless it is something in connection with his religion.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"So they went to see the king and said, “King Darius, may Your Majesty live forever!
