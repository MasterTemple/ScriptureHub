"},{"num":3,"verse":"I also know how you have bravely endured trials and persecutions because of my name, yet you have not become discouraged. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But I have this against you: you have abandoned the passionate love you had for me at the beginning. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Think about how far you have fallen!

"},{"num":10,"verse":"Do not yield to fear in the face of the suffering to come but be aware of this: the devil is about to have some of you thrown into prison to test your faith.

For these are the words of the one whose words pierce the hearts of men:"},{"num":13,"verse":"I know where you live—where Satan sits enthroned, yet you still cling faithfully to the power of my name. You did not deny your faith in me even in the days of my faithful martyr Antipas, who was executed in your city, where Satan lives.

In fact, you now excel in these virtues even more than at the first. "},{"num":20,"verse":"But I have this against you: you are forgiving that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is seducing my loving servants. She is teaching that it is permissible to indulge in sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. "},{"num":21,"verse":"I have waited for her to repent from her vile immorality, but she willingly refuses to do so.
