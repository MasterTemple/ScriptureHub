[{"header":"We ask your prayers for God’s work here"},{"num":1,"verse":"Finally, my brothers, do pray for us here. Pray that the Lord’s message may go forward unhindered and may bring him glory, as it has done with you. Pray, too, that we may not be embroiled with bigoted and wicked men; for all men, alas, have not faith. Yet the Lord is utterly to be depended upon by all who have faith in him, and he will give you stability and protection against all that is evil. It is he who makes us feel confident about you, that you are acting and will act in accordance with our commands. May he guide your hearts into ever deeper understanding of his love and the patient suffering of Christ."},{"header":"Remember our example: everyone should do his fair share of work"},{"num":6,"verse":"One further order we must give you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ: don’t associate with the brother whose life is undisciplined, and who despises the teaching we gave him. You know well that we ourselves are your examples here, and that our lives among you were never undisciplined. We did not eat anyone’s food without paying for it. In fact we toiled and laboured night and day to avoid being the slightest expense to any of you. This was not because we had no right to ask our necessities of you, but because we wanted to set you an example. When we were actually with you we gave you this principle to work on: “If a man will not work, he shall not eat.” Now we hear that you have some among you living quite undisciplined lives, never doing a stroke of work, and busy only in other people’s affairs. Our order to such men, indeed our appeal by the Lord Jesus Christ, is to settle down to work and eat the food they have earned themselves."},{"num":13,"verse":"And the rest of you—don’t get tired of honest work! If anyone refuses to obey the command given above, mark that man, do not associate with him until he is ashamed of himself. I don’t mean, of course, treat him as an enemy, but reprimand him as a brother."},{"header":"My blessing on you all!"},{"num":16,"verse":"Now may the Lord of peace personally give you his peace at all times and in all ways. The Lord be with you all."},{"num":17,"verse":"This is the farewell message of PAUL, written in my own writing—my “mark” on all my letters."},{"num":18,"verse":"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all."}]
