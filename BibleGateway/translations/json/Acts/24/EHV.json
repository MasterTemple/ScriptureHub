[{"header":"Paul on Trial Before Felix"},{"num":24,"verse":"Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They brought formal charges against Paul to the governor."},{"num":2,"verse":"When Paul was called in, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “We are enjoying a long period of peace because of you, most excellent Felix, and reforms are coming to this nation because of your foresight. "},{"num":3,"verse":"In every way and in every place, we acknowledge this with all gratitude. "},{"num":4,"verse":"But in order not to detain you any longer, I beg you in your kindness to give us a brief hearing. "},{"num":5,"verse":"For we have found this man to be a public menace, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the Nazarene sect. "},{"num":6,"verse":"He even tried to desecrate the temple, so we arrested him. "},{"num":8,"verse":"By examining him yourself, you will be able to learn from him about all these accusations we are bringing against him.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so."},{"num":10,"verse":"When the governor motioned to him to speak, Paul replied, “Because I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense. "},{"num":11,"verse":"You can verify for yourself that it was no more than twelve days ago when I went up to worship at Jerusalem. "},{"num":12,"verse":"They did not find me arguing with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. "},{"num":13,"verse":"And they cannot prove to you the accusations they are now making against me."},{"num":14,"verse":"“But I do confess to you that I worship the God of our fathers according to the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything written throughout the Law and in the Prophets; "},{"num":15,"verse":"and I have the same hope in God that these men have, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. "},{"num":16,"verse":"This is the reason I continue to do my best to have a clear conscience toward both God and people."},{"num":17,"verse":"“After several years, I came to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings. "},{"num":18,"verse":"While I was doing these things, they found me ceremonially purified in the temple, without a crowd or disturbance. "},{"num":19,"verse":"But there are some Jews from the province of Asia who ought to be here before you and bring charges, if they have anything against me. "},{"num":20,"verse":"Or let these men here state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin, "},{"num":21,"verse":"unless this is about the one thing I shouted while standing in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”"},{"num":22,"verse":"Then Felix, because he was rather well informed about the Way, adjourned the proceedings. He said, “When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.” "},{"num":23,"verse":"He ordered the centurion to guard Paul, but to let him have some freedom and not to prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs."},{"num":24,"verse":"Several days later, Felix appeared in public with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish.

But because he wanted to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison."}]
