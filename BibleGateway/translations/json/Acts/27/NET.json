"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"After we had sailed across the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we put in at Myra in Lycia. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"We sailed slowly for many days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus. Because the wind prevented us from going any farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there. They hoped that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When a gentle south wind sprang up, they thought they could carry out their purpose, so they weighed anchor and sailed close along the coast of Crete. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Not long after this, a hurricane-force wind called the northeaster blew down from the island. "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"When the ship was caught in it and could not head into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.

Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and steered toward the beach.
