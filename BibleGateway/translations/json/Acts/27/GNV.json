[{"num":27,"verse":"1 Paul 7, 9 foretelleth the peril of the voyage, 11 but he is not believed. 14 They are tossed to and fro with the tempest, 22, 41 and suffer shipwreck: 34 Yet all safe and sound 44 escape to land."},{"num":1,"verse":"Now when it was concluded, that we should sail into Italy, they delivered both Paul, and certain other prisoners unto a Centurion, named Julius, of the band of Augustus."},{"num":2,"verse":"And we entered into a ship of Adramyttium, purposing to sail by the coasts of Asia, and launched forth, and had Aristarchus of Macedonia, a Thessalonian, with us."},{"num":3,"verse":"And the next day we arrived at Sidon: and Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends, that they might refresh him."},{"num":4,"verse":"And

Havens, near unto the which was the city Lasea."},{"num":9,"verse":"So when much time was spent, and sailing was now jeopardous, because also the Fast was now passed, Paul exhorted them,"},{"num":10,"verse":"And said unto them, Sirs, I see that this voyage will be with hurt, and much damage, not of the lading and ship only, but also of our lives."},{"num":11,"verse":"Nevertheless the Centurion believed rather the governor and the master of the ship, than those things which were spoken of Paul."},{"num":12,"verse":"And because the haven

ship."},{"num":19,"verse":"And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship."},{"num":20,"verse":"And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay upon us, all hope that we should be saved, was then taken away."},{"num":21,"verse":"But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Candia: so should ye have gained this hurt and loss."},{"num":22,"verse":"But now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you, save of the ship only."},{"num":23,"verse":"For there stood by me this night the Angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve."},{"num":24,"verse":"Saying, Fear not, Paul: for thou must be brought before Caesar: and lo, God hath given unto thee freely, all that sail with thee."},{"num":25,"verse":"Wherefore, Sirs, be of good courage: for I believe God, that it shall be so as it hath been told me."},{"num":26,"verse":"Howbeit, we must be cast into a certain Island."},{"num":27,"verse":"And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were carried to and fro in the Adriatic sea about midnight,

fathoms."},{"num":29,"verse":"Then fearing lest they should have fallen into some rough places, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished that the day were come."},{"num":30,"verse":"Now as

when it began to be day, Paul exhorted them all to take meat, saying, This is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried, and continued fasting, receiving nothing:"},{"num":34,"verse":"Wherefore I exhort you to take meat: for this is for your safeguard: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you."},{"num":35,"verse":"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all, and brake it, and began to eat."},{"num":36,"verse":"Then were they all of good courage, and they also took meat."},{"num":37,"verse":"Now we were in the ship in all two hundred threescore and sixteen souls."},{"num":38,"verse":"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea."},{"num":39,"verse":"And when it was day, they knew not the country, but they spied a certain creek with a bank, into the which they were minded (if it were possible) to thrust in the ship."},{"num":40,"verse":"So when they had taken up the

pass, that they came all safe to land."}]
