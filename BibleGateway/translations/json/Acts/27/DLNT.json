"},{"num":3,"verse":"And on another day we put in at Sidon. And Julius, having treated Paul humanely, permitted him to obtain care, having gone to his friends. "},{"num":4,"verse":"And from there, having put-to-sea, we sailed-under-the-shelter-of Cyprus because of the winds being contrary. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And having sailed-through the open-sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra of Lycia. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And there the centurion, having found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, put us on board in it. "},{"num":7,"verse":"And in many days, sailing-slowly and with-difficulty, having come-to-be off Cnidus— the wind not permitting us to go farther— we sailed-under-the-shelter-of Crete off Salmone. "},{"num":8,"verse":"And sailing-along it with-difficulty, we came to a certain place being called Fair Havens, near to which was the city Lasea. "},{"num":9,"verse":"And a considerable time having passed, and the voyage being already dangerous because even the Fast had passed-by already, Paul was advising, "},{"num":10,"verse":"saying to them, “Men, I perceive that the voyage will-certainly be with damage and great loss— not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives”.
