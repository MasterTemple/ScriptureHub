"},{"num":3,"verse":"The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for. "},{"num":4,"verse":"And putting to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. "},{"num":5,"verse":"And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cili′cia and Pamphyl′ia, we came to Myra in Ly′cia. "},{"num":6,"verse":"There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and put us on board. "},{"num":7,"verse":"We sailed slowly for a number of days, and arrived with difficulty off Cni′dus, and as the wind did not allow us to go on, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmo′ne. "},{"num":8,"verse":"Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lase′a."},{"num":9,"verse":"As much time had been lost, and the voyage was already dangerous because the fast had already gone by, Paul advised them, "},{"num":10,"verse":"saying, “Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.” "},{"num":11,"verse":"But the centurion paid more attention to the captain and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. "},{"num":12,"verse":"And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to put to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, looking northeast and southeast, and winter there."},{"header":"The Storm at Sea"},{"num":13,"verse":"And when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close inshore.

"},{"num":16,"verse":"And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the boat; "},{"num":17,"verse":"after hoisting it up, they took measures to undergird the ship; then, fearing that they should run on the Syr′tis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven. "},{"num":18,"verse":"As we were violently storm-tossed, they began next day to throw the cargo overboard; "},{"num":19,"verse":"and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackle of the ship.

"},{"num":28,"verse":"So they sounded and found twenty fathoms; a little farther on they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms. "},{"num":29,"verse":"And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let out four anchors from the stern, and prayed for day to come. "},{"num":30,"verse":"And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow, "},{"num":31,"verse":"Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.” "},{"num":32,"verse":"Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it go."},{"num":33,"verse":"As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing.
