[{"header":"Peter and John before the Council"},{"num":4,"verse":"Peter and John were still speaking to the people when some priests, the officer in charge of the Temple guards, and some Sadducees arrived. "},{"num":2,"verse":"They were annoyed because the two apostles were teaching the people that Jesus had risen from death, which proved that the dead will rise to life. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So they arrested them and put them in jail until the next day, since it was already late.

They realized then that they had been companions of Jesus. "},{"num":14,"verse":"But there was nothing that they could say, because they saw the man who had been healed standing there with Peter and John. "},{"num":15,"verse":"So they told them to leave the Council room, and then they started discussing among themselves. "},{"num":16,"verse":"“What shall we do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone in Jerusalem knows that this extraordinary miracle has been performed by them, and we cannot deny it. "},{"num":17,"verse":"But to keep this matter from spreading any further among the people, let us warn these men never again to speak to anyone in the name of Jesus.”"},{"num":18,"verse":"So they called them back in and told them that under no condition were they to speak or to teach in the name of Jesus.
