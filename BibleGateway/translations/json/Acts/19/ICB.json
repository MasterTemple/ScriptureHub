"},{"num":7,"verse":"There were about 12 men in this group."},{"num":8,"verse":"Paul went into the synagogue and spoke out boldly for three months. He talked with the Jews and persuaded them to accept the things he said about the kingdom of God. "},{"num":9,"verse":"But some of the Jews became stubborn and refused to believe.

"},{"num":38,"verse":"We have courts of law, and there are judges. Do Demetrius and the men who work with him have a charge against anyone? They should go to the courts!
