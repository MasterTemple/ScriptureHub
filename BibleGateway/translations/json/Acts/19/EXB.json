They refused to believe and ·said evil things about [slandered; cursed] ·the Way of Jesus [the Way; another name for the Christian movement; 9:2; 18:25; 22:4] before ·all the people [the crowd]. So Paul left them, and taking the ·followers [disciples] with him, he went to the ·school [lecture hall] of a man named Tyrannus. There Paul ·talked [discussed; reasoned; debated] with people every day "},{"num":10,"verse":"for two years. Because of his work, ·everyone who lived in [the whole population of] the province of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord."},{"header":"The Sons of Sceva"},{"num":11,"verse":"God ·used Paul to do [through the hands of Paul did] some ·very special [extraordinary] miracles. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Some people took ·handkerchiefs [face cloths] and ·clothes [work aprons; or hand towels] ·that Paul had used [that had touched Paul; from his skin] and put them on the sick.
