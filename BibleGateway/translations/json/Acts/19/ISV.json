[{"header":"Paul in Ephesus"},{"num":19,"verse":"It was while Apollos was in Corinth that Paul passed through the inland districts and came to Ephesus.

"},{"num":6,"verse":"When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in foreign languages and to prophesy. "},{"num":7,"verse":"There were about twelve men in all."},{"num":8,"verse":"He went into the synagogue and spoke there boldly for three months, holding discussions and persuading those who heard him about the kingdom of God. "},{"num":9,"verse":"But when some people became stubborn, refused to believe, and slandered the Way in front of the people, Paul left them, taking his disciples away with him, and held daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. "},{"num":10,"verse":"This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the word of the Lord. "},{"num":11,"verse":"God continued to do extraordinary miracles through Paul.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"When this became known to everyone living in Ephesus, Jews and Greeks alike, they all became terrified, and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in high honor. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Many who became believers kept coming to confess and talk about what they had been doing. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Moreover, many people who had practiced occult arts gathered their books and burned them in front of everybody.
