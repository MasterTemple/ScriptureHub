"},{"num":3,"verse":"“Leave your country and your people,” God said, “and go to the land I will show you.”"},{"num":4,"verse":"‘So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. "},{"num":6,"verse":"God spoke to him in this way: “For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and ill-treated. "},{"num":7,"verse":"But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,” God said, “and afterwards they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs."},{"num":9,"verse":"‘Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him "},{"num":10,"verse":"and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt. So Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace."},{"num":11,"verse":"‘Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food. "},{"num":12,"verse":"When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers on their first visit. "},{"num":13,"verse":"On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family.

"},{"num":26,"verse":"The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, “Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?”"},{"num":27,"verse":"‘But the man who was ill-treating the other pushed Moses aside and said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? "},{"num":28,"verse":"Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?” "},{"num":29,"verse":"When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons."},{"num":30,"verse":"‘After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. "},{"num":31,"verse":"When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to get a closer look, he heard the Lord say: "},{"num":32,"verse":"“I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look."},{"num":33,"verse":"‘Then the Lord said to him, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. "},{"num":34,"verse":"I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.”"},{"num":35,"verse":"‘This is the same Moses they had rejected with the words, “Who made you ruler and judge?” He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. "},{"num":36,"verse":"He led them out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the wilderness."},{"num":37,"verse":"‘This is the Moses who told the Israelites, “God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people.” "},{"num":38,"verse":"He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us."},{"num":39,"verse":"‘But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. "},{"num":40,"verse":"They told Aaron, “Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt – we don’t know what has happened to him!” "},{"num":41,"verse":"That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and revelled in what their own hands had made. "},{"num":42,"verse":"But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon and stars. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets:"},{"num":44,"verse":"‘Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen. "},{"num":45,"verse":"After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David, "},{"num":46,"verse":"who enjoyed God’s favour and asked that he might provide a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob. "},{"num":47,"verse":"But it was Solomon who built a house for him."},{"num":48,"verse":"‘However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands.
