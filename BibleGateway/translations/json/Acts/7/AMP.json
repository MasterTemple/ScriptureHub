"},{"num":5,"verse":"But He did not give him inheritable property, not even enough ground to take a step on, yet He promised that He would give it to Him as a possession, and to his descendants after him. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And this is, in effect, what God spoke [to him]: That his descendants would be aliens (strangers) in a foreign land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years. "},{"num":7,"verse":"‘And I will judge any nation to whom they will be in bondage,’ said God, ‘and after that they will come out and serve Me [in worship] in this place.’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"And God gave Abraham a covenant [a formal agreement to be strictly observed] of [which] circumcision [was the sign]; and so [under these circumstances] Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac [became the father] of Jacob, and Jacob [became the father] of the twelve patriarchs."},{"num":9,"verse":"“The [ten elder] patriarchs, overwhelmed with jealousy, sold [their younger brother] Joseph into [slavery in] Egypt; but God was with him, "},{"num":10,"verse":"and He rescued him from all his suffering, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made Joseph governor over Egypt and over his entire household."},{"num":11,"verse":"“Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great distress and our fathers could not find food [for their households and livestock].

"},{"num":26,"verse":"Then on the next day he suddenly appeared to two of them as they were fighting, and he tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong one another?’ "},{"num":27,"verse":"But the man who was injuring his neighbor pushed Moses away, saying, ‘Who appointed you ruler and judge over us? "},{"num":28,"verse":"Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ "},{"num":29,"verse":"At this remark Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons."},{"num":30,"verse":"“After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning thorn bush.
