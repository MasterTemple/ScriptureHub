"},{"num":4,"verse":"Did it not belong to you alone? And after it was sold, was the money not at your own disposal? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."},{"num":5,"verse":"When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and gave up the spirit. And great fear came on all them that heard these things. "},{"num":6,"verse":"And the young men rose up, and put Ananias apart, and carried him out and buried him."},{"num":7,"verse":"And then, about the space of three hours after, his wife came in, unaware of what had happened. "},{"num":8,"verse":"And Peter said to her, Tell me, did you sell the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Then Peter said to her, Why have you agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and will carry you out."},{"num":10,"verse":"Then she fell down straightaway at his feet and yielded up the spirit. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carried her out and buried her by her husband."},{"num":11,"verse":"And great fear came on all the congregation, and on as many as heard these things."},{"num":12,"verse":"By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were shown among the people.

And the chief priest asked them, "},{"num":28,"verse":"saying, Did we not strictly order you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man’s blood upon us."},{"num":29,"verse":"Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought more to obey God than men. "},{"num":30,"verse":"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew, hanging him on a tree. "},{"num":31,"verse":"Him God has lifted up with his right hand, to be a ruler and a saviour, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
