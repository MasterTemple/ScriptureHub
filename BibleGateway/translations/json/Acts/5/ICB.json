The high priest questioned them. "},{"num":28,"verse":"He said, “We gave you strict orders not to go on teaching in that name. But look what you have done! You have filled Jerusalem with your teaching. You are trying to make us responsible for this man’s death.”"},{"num":29,"verse":"Peter and the other apostles answered, “We must obey God, not men!
