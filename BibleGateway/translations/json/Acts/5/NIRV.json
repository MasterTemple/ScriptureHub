He made you lie to the Holy Spirit. You have kept some of the money you received for the land. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Didn’t the land belong to you before it was sold? After it was sold, you could have used the money as you wished. What made you think of doing such a thing? You haven’t lied just to people.
