"},{"num":4,"verse":"While it was still yours, it belonged to you, didn’t it? And, when you sold it, it was still in your power! Why did you get such an idea in your heart? It isn’t humans that you’ve lied to: it’s God!’"},{"num":5,"verse":"When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. Everyone who heard about it was scared out of their wits. "},{"num":6,"verse":"The young men got up, took him away, wrapped up his body and buried him."},{"num":7,"verse":"After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened."},{"num":8,"verse":"Peter spoke to her."},{"num":9,"verse":"‘So why’, Peter answered, ‘did you agree together to put the holy spirit to the test? Look: the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door – and they will carry you out too!’"},{"num":10,"verse":"At once she fell down at his feet and died. The young men were just coming in, and they found her dead, so they took her out and buried her beside her husband.

The high priest questioned them."},{"num":28,"verse":"‘We gave you strict orders, didn’t we?’ he demanded. ‘We told you not to teach in this Name, and look what you’re doing! You have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you’re trying to bring this man’s blood on us!’"},{"num":29,"verse":"‘We must obey God, not human beings!’ responded Peter and the apostles.
