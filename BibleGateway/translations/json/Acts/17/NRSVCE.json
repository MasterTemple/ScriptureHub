[{"header":"The Uproar in Thessalonica"},{"num":17,"verse":"After Paul and Silas had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. "},{"num":2,"verse":"And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three sabbath days argued with them from the scriptures, "},{"num":3,"verse":"explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Messiah to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, “This is the Messiah, Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. "},{"num":5,"verse":"But the Jews became jealous, and with the help of some ruffians in the marketplaces they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar. While they were searching for Paul and Silas to bring them out to the assembly, they attacked Jason’s house. "},{"num":6,"verse":"When they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some believers before the city authorities, shouting, “These people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also, "},{"num":7,"verse":"and Jason has entertained them as guests. They are all acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor, saying that there is another king named Jesus.” "},{"num":8,"verse":"The people and the city officials were disturbed when they heard this, "},{"num":9,"verse":"and after they had taken bail from Jason and the others, they let them go."},{"header":"Paul and Silas in Beroea"},{"num":10,"verse":"That very night the believers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and when they arrived, they went to the Jewish synagogue. "},{"num":11,"verse":"These Jews were more receptive than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message very eagerly and examined the scriptures every day to see whether these things were so. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Many of them therefore believed, including not a few Greek women and men of high standing. "},{"num":13,"verse":"But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Beroea as well, they came there too, to stir up and incite the crowds. "},{"num":14,"verse":"Then the believers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy remained behind. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and after receiving instructions to have Silas and Timothy join him as soon as possible, they left him."},{"header":"Paul in Athens"},{"num":16,"verse":"While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and also in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Also some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers debated with him. Some said, “What does this babbler want to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign divinities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.) "},{"num":19,"verse":"So they took him and brought him to the Areopagus and asked him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? "},{"num":20,"verse":"It sounds rather strange to us, so we would like to know what it means.” "},{"num":21,"verse":"Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there would spend their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new."},{"num":22,"verse":"Then Paul stood in front of the Areopagus and said, “Athenians, I see how extremely religious you are in every way.
