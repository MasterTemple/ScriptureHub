"},{"num":2,"verse":"As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, "},{"num":3,"verse":"explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. ‘This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,’ he said. "},{"num":4,"verse":"Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women."},{"num":5,"verse":"But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the market-place, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: ‘These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, "},{"num":7,"verse":"and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.’ "},{"num":8,"verse":"When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. "},{"num":9,"verse":"Then they put Jason and the others on bail and let them go."},{"header":"In Berea"},{"num":10,"verse":"As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. "},{"num":11,"verse":"Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. "},{"num":12,"verse":"As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men."},{"num":13,"verse":"But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. "},{"num":15,"verse":"Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible."},{"header":"In Athens"},{"num":16,"verse":"While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the market-place day by day with those who happened to be there. "},{"num":18,"verse":"A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, ‘What is this babbler trying to say?’ Others remarked, ‘He seems to be advocating foreign gods.’ They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, ‘May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? "},{"num":20,"verse":"You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean.’ "},{"num":21,"verse":"(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)"},{"num":22,"verse":"Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: ‘People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. "},{"num":23,"verse":"For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown god.

"},{"num":31,"verse":"For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.’"},{"num":32,"verse":"When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, ‘We want to hear you again on this subject.’ "},{"num":33,"verse":"At that, Paul left the Council.
