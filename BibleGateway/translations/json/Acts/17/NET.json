"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But the Jews became jealous, and gathering together some worthless men from the rabble in the marketplace, they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, trying to find Paul and Silas to bring them out to the assembly.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"But when the Jews from Thessalonica heard that Paul had also proclaimed the word of God in Berea, they came there too, inciting and disturbing the crowds.

"}],[{"type":"prose","content":"Also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him, and some were asking, “What does this foolish babbler want to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods.” (They said this because he was proclaiming the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.) "}],[{"type":"prose","content":"So they took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are proclaiming?
