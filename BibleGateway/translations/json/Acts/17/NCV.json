"},{"num":2,"verse":"Paul went into the synagogue as he always did, and on each Sabbath day for three weeks, he talked with his fellow Jews about the Scriptures. "},{"num":3,"verse":"He explained and proved that the Christ must die and then rise from the dead. He said, “This Jesus I am telling you about is the Christ.” "},{"num":4,"verse":"Some of them were convinced and joined Paul and Silas, along with many of the Greeks who worshiped God and many of the important women."},{"num":5,"verse":"But some others became jealous. So they got some evil men from the marketplace, formed a mob, and started a riot. They ran to Jason’s house, looking for Paul and Silas, wanting to bring them out to the people. "},{"num":6,"verse":"But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers to the leaders of the city. The people were yelling, “These people have made trouble everywhere in the world, and now they have come here too! "},{"num":7,"verse":"Jason is keeping them in his house. All of them do things against the laws of Caesar, saying there is another king, called Jesus.”"},{"num":8,"verse":"When the people and the leaders of the city heard these things, they became very upset.

"},{"num":11,"verse":"These people were more willing to listen than the people in Thessalonica. The Bereans were eager to hear what Paul and Silas said and studied the Scriptures every day to find out if these things were true. "},{"num":12,"verse":"So, many of them believed, as well as many important Greek women and men. "},{"num":13,"verse":"But the people in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God in Berea, too. So they came there, upsetting the people and making trouble. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The believers quickly sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea. "},{"num":15,"verse":"The people leading Paul went with him to Athens.

"},{"num":17,"verse":"In the synagogue, he talked with the Jews and the Greeks who worshiped God. He also talked every day with people in the marketplace."},{"num":18,"verse":"Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers argued with him, saying, “This man doesn’t know what he is talking about. What is he trying to say?” Others said, “He seems to be telling us about some other gods,” because Paul was telling them about Jesus and his rising from the dead. "},{"num":19,"verse":"They got Paul and took him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said, “Please explain to us this new idea you have been teaching.

"},{"num":23,"verse":"As I was going through your city, I saw the objects you worship. I found an altar that had these words written on it: to a god who is not known. You worship a god that you don’t know, and this is the God I am telling you about! "},{"num":24,"verse":"The God who made the whole world and everything in it is the Lord of the land and the sky.

And God has proved this to everyone by raising that man from the dead!”"},{"num":32,"verse":"When the people heard about Jesus being raised from the dead, some of them laughed. But others said, “We will hear more about this from you later.” "},{"num":33,"verse":"So Paul went away from them. "},{"num":34,"verse":"But some of the people believed Paul and joined him.
