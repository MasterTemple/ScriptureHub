[{"num":17,"verse":"After leaving Philippi and passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came to Thessalonica. There was a Jewish synagogue there. "},{"num":2,"verse":"As he had done in other cities, Paul attended the synagogue and presented arguments, based on the Hebrew Scriptures, that the Anointed had to suffer and rise from the dead."},{"num":4,"verse":"Some of the ethnically Jewish people from the synagogue were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas. Even more devout Greeks who had affiliated with Judaism came to believe—along with quite a few of the city’s leading women. "},{"num":5,"verse":"Seeing this movement growing, the unconvinced Jewish people became protective and angry. They found some ruffians hanging out in the marketplaces and convinced them to help start a riot. Soon a mob formed, and the whole city was seething with tension. The mob was going street by street, looking for Paul and Silas—who were nowhere to be found. Frustrated, when the mob came to the house of a man named Jason, now known as a believer, they grabbed him and some other believers they found there and dragged them to the city officials."},{"num":8,"verse":"Of course, this disturbed the crowd at large and the city officials especially, "},{"num":9,"verse":"so they demanded bail from Jason and the others before releasing them."},{"num":10,"verse":"The believers waited until dark and then sent Paul and Silas off to Berea. When they arrived, they went to the synagogue."},{"num":11,"verse":"The Jewish people here were more receptive than they had been in Thessalonica. They warmly and enthusiastically welcomed the message and then, day by day, would check for themselves to see if what they heard from Paul and Silas was truly in harmony with the Hebrew Scriptures. "},{"num":12,"verse":"Many of them were convinced, and the new believers included—as in Thessalonica—quite a few of the city’s leading Greek women and important men also. "},{"num":13,"verse":"Reports got back to Thessalonica that Paul and Silas were now spreading God’s message in Berea; the Jewish people who had incited the riot in Thessalonica quickly came to Berea to do the same once again. "},{"num":14,"verse":"The believers sent Paul away. A small group escorted him, first to the coast, and then all the way to Athens. Silas and Timothy, however, remained in Berea. Later they received instructions from Paul to join him in Athens as soon as possible."},{"num":16,"verse":"So Paul found himself alone for some time in Athens. He would walk through the city, feeling deeply frustrated about the abundance of idols there. "},{"num":17,"verse":"As in the previous cities, he went to the synagogue. Once again, he engaged in debate about Jesus with both ethnic Jews and devout Greek-born converts to Judaism. He would even wander around in the marketplace, speaking with anyone he happened to meet. "},{"num":18,"verse":"Eventually he got into a debate with some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers. Some were dismissive from the start."},{"num":19,"verse":"This stirred their curiosity, because the favorite pastime of Athenians (including foreigners who had settled there) was conversation about new and unusual ideas. So they brought him to the rock outcropping known as the Areopagus, where Athens’ intellectuals regularly gathered for debate, and they invited him to speak."},{"num":32,"verse":"When they heard that last phrase about resurrection from the dead, some shook their heads and scoffed, but others were even more curious."},{"num":33,"verse":"Paul left at that point, "},{"num":34,"verse":"but some people followed him and came to faith, including one from Areopagus named Dionysius, a prominent woman named Damaris, and others."}]
