"},{"num":3,"verse":"They came asking him for a favor—that he would transfer Paul from Caesarea to Jerusalem—all the while plotting to ambush and kill Paul along the way."},{"num":4,"verse":"Festus responded to their request by informing them that he planned to return to Caesarea shortly. "},{"num":5,"verse":"He told them, “Your leaders can come with me to Caesarea. If this man has broken any laws, you can bring charges against him there.”"},{"num":6,"verse":"After Festus had stayed in Jerusalem no more than eight to ten days, he left for Caesarea. The day after he arrived, he convened the court and took his seat on the bench as judge over the proceedings.

I’ve committed no offense against Jewish law, or against the temple, or against Caesar.”"},{"num":9,"verse":"Festus, because he wanted to curry favor with the Jews, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go with me to Jerusalem and be tried for these charges?”"},{"num":10,"verse":"Paul replied, “I am standing here before Caesar’s tribunal. This is where I should be tried. As you well know, I have done no harm to the Jews. "},{"num":11,"verse":"If I have committed a crime worthy of death, I won’t seek to escape the death penalty.

"},{"num":15,"verse":"When I was in Jerusalem, the leading priests and Jewish elders pressed charges against him and demanded that I issue a guilty verdict against him. "},{"num":16,"verse":"I explained to them that it is not our Roman custom to condemn any man before he has an opportunity to face his accusers and present his defense. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So they returned here with me. I didn’t postpone the trial, but convened the court the very next day and ordered the man to be brought before me. "},{"num":18,"verse":"I listened to their accusations against him, but they were not what I expected to hear, for he had committed no crime.

"},{"num":20,"verse":"Because I was perplexed about how to proceed, I asked him if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem to stand trial on these charges.
