"},{"num":14,"verse":"While they were staying there several days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a man left behind as a prisoner by Felix. "},{"num":15,"verse":"When I was in Jerusalem, the ruling kohanim and elders of the Judeans brought charges against him, asking for a judgment against him. "},{"num":16,"verse":"I answered them that it is not Roman practice to turn over anyone before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense concerning the charges. "},{"num":17,"verse":"So when they came together here, I did not delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat and ordered the man to be brought in. "},{"num":18,"verse":"When the accusers stood up, they were not bringing a charge of what crimes I suspected. "},{"num":19,"verse":"Instead, they had certain issues with him about their own religion and about a certain Yeshua, who had died, whom Paul claimed to be alive."},{"num":20,"verse":"“Since I was at a loss as to how to investigate these matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem to be tried there in regard to them.
