They talked much against him. But they could not prove that the things they said were true."},{"num":8,"verse":"Paul spoke for himself. He said, `I have done no wrong to the law, or to the temple, or against Caesar the ruler of the Romans.'"},{"num":9,"verse":"Festus wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he said to Paul, `Will you go to Jerusalem and let me judge you there about these things?'"},{"num":10,"verse":"Paul said, `I am standing in Caesar's court.

Then he has a chance to speak for himself."},{"num":17,"verse":"So they came here with me. I did not wait. The very next day I sat on my chair in the court and had the man brought in."},{"num":18,"verse":"When they stood up, they did not say the wrong things against him that I thought they would."},{"num":19,"verse":"But instead, they had a quarrel with him about the things they believe in.
