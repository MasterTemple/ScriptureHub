[{"num":12,"verse":"Back in Jerusalem, hard times came to the disciples. King Herod violently seized some who belonged to the church with the intention of mistreating them.

He taps Peter on the side, awakening him."},{"num":9,"verse":"Peter does so, but he is completely dazed. He doesn’t think this is really happening—he assumes he is dreaming or having a vision. "},{"num":10,"verse":"They pass the first guard. They pass the second guard. They come to the iron gate that opens to the city. The gate swings open for them on its own, and they walk into a lane.
