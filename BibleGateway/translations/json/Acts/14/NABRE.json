In Iconium they entered the Jewish synagogue together and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks came to believe, "},{"num":2,"verse":"although the disbelieving Jews stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers. "},{"num":3,"verse":"So they stayed for a considerable period, speaking out boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the word about his grace by granting signs and wonders to occur through their hands. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The people of the city were divided: some were with the Jews; others, with the apostles. "},{"num":5,"verse":"When there was an attempt by both the Gentiles and the Jews, together with their leaders, to attack and stone them, "},{"num":6,"verse":"they realized it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding countryside, "},{"num":7,"verse":"where they continued to proclaim the good news."},{"num":8,"verse":"Paul and Barnabas at Lystra. At Lystra there was a crippled man, lame from birth, who had never walked.

"},{"num":11,"verse":"When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they cried out in Lycaonian, “The gods have come down to us in human form.” "},{"num":12,"verse":"They called Barnabas “Zeus” and Paul “Hermes,” because he was the chief speaker. "},{"num":13,"verse":"And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, for he together with the people intended to offer sacrifice."},{"num":14,"verse":"The apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their garments when they heard this and rushed out into the crowd, shouting, "},{"num":15,"verse":"“Men, why are you doing this? We are of the same nature as you, human beings.
