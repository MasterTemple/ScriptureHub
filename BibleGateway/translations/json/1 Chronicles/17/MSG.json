I’m going to set aside a place for my people Israel and plant them there so they’ll have their own home and not be knocked around anymore; nor will evil nations afflict them as they always have, even during the days I set judges over my people Israel.

You established for yourself a people—your very own Israel!—your people forever. And you, , became their God.So now, great , this word that you have spoken to me and my family, guarantee it forever! Do exactly what you’ve promised!

You, my God, have told me plainly, “I will build you a house.” That’s how I was able to find the courage to pray this prayer to you. , being the God you are, you have spoken all these wonderful words to me. As if that weren’t enough, you’ve blessed my family so that it will continue in your presence always. Because you have blessed it, , it’s  blessed—blessed for good!"}]]
