[{"num":25,"verse":"David and the heads of the Levites, also known as the commanders of the army, selected for the service some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun. These men were expected to serve in the temple by prophesying with lyres, harps, and cymbals. These are the singers who performed these duties in order of their descent. "},{"num":2,"verse":"The sons of Asaph (Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah) were directed by Asaph who prophesied because the king appointed him that duty. "},{"num":3,"verse":"The six sons of Jeduthun (Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah) were directed by their father Jeduthun who used the harp to prophesy, as well as to testify about the Eternal. "},{"num":4,"verse":"The 14 sons of Heman the kingâ€™s prophet were Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. His many sons and three daughters gave Heman prominence before God. "},{"num":6,"verse":"All these were directed by their father to sing with cymbals, harps, and lyres in the temple of the Eternal. These three families, 288 of whom were musically skilled, worked in the temple singing to the Eternal, but they served the king."},{"num":8,"verse":"All of these men, the weak and the mighty, the students and the teachers, used a system of lots to determine their duties. These are the singers who performed in the temple in order of their duties: "},{"num":9,"verse":"Joseph (son of Asaph) drew the first lot; and the other singers drew lots in this order, second through 24th: Gedaliah, Zaccur, Izri, Nethaniah, Bukkiah, Jesharelah, Jeshaiah, Mattaniah, Shimei, Azarel, Hashabiah, Shubael, Mattithiah, Jeremoth, Hananiah, Joshbekashah, Hanani, Mallothi, Eliathah, Hothir, Giddalti, Mahazioth, and finally, Romamti-ezer. Each man who drew a lot represented 12 men, including his sons, his brothers, and himself, and these 24 groups served in the temple two weeks each year as the Levites did."}]
