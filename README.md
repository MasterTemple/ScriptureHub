# ScriptureHub
This is basically BibleHub but with a new UI.

# How to Use

<!-- ### Navigation
Left: The Selected Passage in Several Translations
Right: C -->

## Searching
Valid Search Queries Appear as Follows: `John 1`, `John 1:1`, `John 1:1-51`

You may also add the preferred translation at the end of the verse, `John 1:1 NKJV`, and it will move that translation to the top, as well as preview that translation in the `Context Section`.

**Note: Capitalization does not matter!**

Searching for `john 1:1-3 nasb` works. The search bar will auto capitalize it to `John 1:1-3 NASB` as you type.


# Preview
Visit [here](https://mastertemple.github.io/ScriptureHub) to preview this site. It will take a second or two to load because it's just a link to an HTML preview site, but after that loading everything else will be fine.

# Bugs
Most things should work, however, I am aware that most verse translations (on the left or in the `Context` section) do not work for the prophets and poetry. Old Testament Narrative and the entire New Testament should work. The interlinear and commentaries should work for all verses, however some commentaries might have incorrect spacing.
