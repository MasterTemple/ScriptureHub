When it is said that he can \"do nothing\" of himself, it is meant that such is the union subsisting between the Father and the Son that he can do nothing \"independently\" or separate from the Father. Such is the nature of this union that he can do nothing which has not the concurrence of the Father, and which he does not command. In all things he must, from the necessity of his nature, act in accordance with the nature and will of God. Such is the intimacy of the union, that the fact that \"he\" does anything is proof that it is by the concurring agency of God.
