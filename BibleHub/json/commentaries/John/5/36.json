But the sense in which Dr. Whitby takes the words, seems to connect them more naturally with the preceding verse: thus, “Nor are you to expect that the Father should testify of me otherwise than by his works, for that which was granted to your fathers belongs not to you, namely, to see his glory and hear his voice out of the midst of the fire.

It is impossible to dissociate these \"works \"from those great miracles which ought to command assent to his claims, even if, alas! his bare words are not sufficiently convincing.

The entire work, reaching special expression in certain typical acts and deeds, was greater than the verbal testimony which John bare to his mission. All that John said was true, but Christ's \"works\" prove it. John 5:36",
