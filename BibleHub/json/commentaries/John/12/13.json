The words of the twenty-fifth verse were sung during that feast, when the altar of burnt-offering was solemnly compassed; that is, once on each of the first six days of the feast, and seven times on the seventh day. This seventh day was called \"the Great Hosanna,\" and not only the prayers for the feast, but even the branches of trees, including the myrtles which were attached to the palm branch, were called \"Hosannas.\"",
