If a call to expose ourselves to danger be clear, we may hope God will enable us to honour him; if it be not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame ourselves. They said nothing concerning the miracles of Jesus, by which he had done so much good, and which proved his doctrine. Thus the enemies of Christ, whilst they quarrel with his truth, wilfully shut their eyes against it. He appeals to those who heard him. The doctrine of Christ may safely appeal to all that know it, and those who judge in truth bear witness to it. Our resentment of injuries must never be passionate.

These two statements are extremely interesting. His wishing to \"see the end,\" of issue of these proceedings, was what led him into the palace, for he evidently feared the worst. But once in, the serpent coil is drawn closer; it is a cold night, and why should not he take advantage of the fire as well as others? Besides, in the talk of the crowd about the all-engrossing topic, he may pick up something which he would like to hear. \"And as Peter was beneath in the palace\" (Mr 14:66). Matthew (Mt 26:69) says, \"sat without in the palace.\" According to Oriental architecture, and especially in large buildings, as here, the street door—or heavy folding gate through which single persons entered by a wicket kept by a porter—opened by a passage or \"porch\" (Mr 14:68) into a quadrangular court, here called the \"palace\" or hall, which was open above, and is frequently paved with flagstones. In the center of this court the \"fire\" would be kindled (in a brazier). At the upper end of it, probably, was the chamber in which the trial was held, open to the court and not far from the fire (Lu 22:61), but on a higher level; for Mark (Mr 14:66) says the court was \"beneath\" it. The ascent was, perhaps, by a short flight of steps. This explanation will make the intensely interesting details more intelligible.",

The passover was always in the spring of the year, when nights are commonly cold, as they are generally observed to be at the vernal equinox: this night might be remarkably cold; which seems to be suggested by the Persic version, which reads, \"for it was cold that night\"; and the Ethiopic version, \"for the cold of that night was great\"; and adds what is neither in the text, nor true, \"for the country was cold\". The Arabic version, as it should seem, very wrongly renders it, \"for it was winter\"; since the passover was never kept in the winter season, but always in the spring, in the month Nisan: the winter season, with the Jews, were half the month of Chisleu, all Tebeth, and half Shebet (o); though this is to be observed in favour of that version, that the Jews distinguish their winter into two parts; the one they call  which, as the gloss says, is the strength of winter, the coldest part of it, and which lasts the time before mentioned; and the other they call  which is the end of winter, and when the cold is not so strong; and half Nisan is taken into this; for they say that half Shebat, all Adar, and half Nisan, are reckoned to this part of winter: so that, according to this account, the fourteenth of Nisan, which was the day on which the passover was killed; or at least the fifteenth, which was now begun, was the last day of winter, and so just secures the credit of the above version.
