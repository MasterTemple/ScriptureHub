The cold-bloodedness of this speech was only exceeded by the deed itself. \"And Judas went before them [Lu 22:47], and forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master, and kissed Him\" (Mt 26:49; compare Ex 4:27; 18:7; Lu 7:45). The impudence of this atrocious deed shows how thoroughly he had by this time mastered all his scruples. If the dialogue between our Lord and His captors was before this, as some interpreters think it was, the kiss of Judas was purely gratuitous, and probably to make good his right to the money; our Lord having presented Himself unexpectedly before them, and rendered it unnecessary for any one to point Him out. But a comparison of the narratives seems to show that our Lord's \"coming forth\" to the band was subsequent to the interview of Judas. \"And Jesus said unto him, Friend\"—not the endearing term \"friend\" (in Joh 15:15), but \"companion,\" a word used on occasions of remonstrance or rebuke (as in Mt 20:13; 22:12)—\"Wherefore art thou come?\" (Mt 26:50). \"Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss\"—imprinting upon the foulest act the mark of tenderest affection? What wounded feeling does this express! Of this Jesus showed Himself on various occasions keenly susceptible—as all generous and beautiful natures do.",
