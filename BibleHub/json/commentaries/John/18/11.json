Matthew adds to the address to Peter the following:—\"For all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword\" (Mt 26:52)—that is, 'Those who take the sword must run all the risks of human warfare; but Mine is a warfare whose weapons, as they are not carnal, are attended with no such hazards, but carry certain victory.' \"Thinkest thou that I cannot now\"—even after things have proceeded so far—\"pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me\"—rather, \"place at My disposal\"—\"more than twelve legions of angels\"; with allusion, possibly, to the one angel who had, in His agony, \"appeared to Him from heaven strengthening Him\" (Lu 22:43); and in the precise number, alluding to the twelve who needed the help, Himself and His eleven disciples. (The full complement of a legion of Roman soldiers was six thousand). \"But how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that thus it must be?\" (Mt 26:53, 54). He could not suffer, according to the Scripture, if He allowed Himself to be delivered from the predicted death. \"And He touched his ear and healed him\" (Lu 22:51); for \"the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them\" (Lu 9:56), and, even while they were destroying His, to save theirs.",
