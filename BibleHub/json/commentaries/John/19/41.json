The embalming was done by Nicodemus, a secret friend to Christ, though not his constant follower. That grace which at first is like a bruised reed, may afterward resemble a strong cedar. Hereby these two rich men showed the value they had for Christ's person and doctrine, and that it was not lessened by the reproach of the cross. We must do our duty as the present day and opportunity are, and leave it to God to fulfil his promises in his own way and his own time. The grave of Jesus was appointed with the wicked, as was the case of those who suffered as criminals; but he was with the rich in his death, as prophesied, Isa 53:9; these two circumstances it was very unlikely should ever be united in the same person. He was buried in a new sepulchre; therefore it could not be said that it was not he, but some other that rose. We also are here taught not to be particular as to the place of our burial. He was buried in the sepulchre next at hand. Here is the Sun of Righteousness set for a while, to rise again in greater glory, and then to set no more.",

Not its being \"hewn out of a rock\" (Mr 15:46), accessible only at the entrance, which doubtless would impress them with its security and suitableness. But it was \"a new sepulchre\" (Joh 19:41), \"wherein never man before was laid\" (Lu 23:53): and Matthew (Mt 27:60) says that Joseph laid Him \"in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock\"—doubtless for his own use, though the Lord had higher use for it. Thus as He rode into Jerusalem on an ass \"whereon never man before had sat\" (Mr 11:2), so now He shall lie in a tomb wherein never man before had lain, that from these specimens it may be seen that in all things He was \"SEPARATE FROM SINNERS\" (Heb 7:26).
