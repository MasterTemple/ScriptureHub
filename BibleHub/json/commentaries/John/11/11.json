A true Christian, when he dies, does but sleep; he rests from the labours of the past day. Nay, herein death is better than sleep, that sleep is only a short rest, but death is the end of earthly cares and toils. The disciples thought that it was now needless for Christ to go to Lazarus, and expose himself and them. Thus we often hope that the good work we are called to do, will be done by some other hand, if there be peril in the doing of it. But when Christ raised Lazarus from the dead, many were brought to believe on him; and there was much done to make perfect the faith of those that believed. Let us go to him; death cannot separate from the love of Christ, nor put us out of the reach of his call. Like Thomas, in difficult times Christians should encourage one another. The dying of the Lord Jesus should make us willing to die whenever God calls us.",

Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may wake him out of sleep—Illustrious title! \"Our friend Lazarus.\" To Abraham only is it accorded in the Old Testament, and not till after his death, (2Ch 20:7; Isa 41:8), to which our attention is called in the New Testament (Jas 2:23). When Jesus came in the flesh, His forerunner applied this name, in a certain sense, to himself (Joh 3:29); and into the same fellowship the Lord's chosen disciples are declared to have come (Joh 15:13-15). \"The phrase here employed, \"our friend Lazarus,\" means more than \"he whom Thou lovest\" in Joh 11:3, for it implies that Christ's affection was reciprocated by Lazarus\" [Lampe]. Our Lord had been told only that Lazarus was \"sick.\" But the change which his two days' delay had produced is here tenderly alluded to. Doubtless, His spirit was all the while with His dying, and now dead \"friend.\" The symbol of \"sleep\" for death is common to all languages, and familiar to us in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, however, a higher meaning is put into it, in relation to believers in Jesus (see on [1830]1Th 4:14), a sense hinted at, and clearly, in Ps 17:15 [Luthardt]; and the \"awaking out of sleep\" acquires a corresponding sense far transcending bare resuscitation.",
