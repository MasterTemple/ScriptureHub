And the root of this is your unbelief: did you receive and believe the word that I have spoken to you, you would do otherwise; but although the sound of my word pierceth your ears, and then you receive a little of it, yet it passeth not into your hearts, it hath no place within you; you do not believe it, you are not affected with it, it doth not dwell in you as it ought to do, so that you are not turned into the likeness and obedience of it. Men may be professors and members of the church of God, in whom yet the word of God hath no rooting, and findeth no true place; so as that their condition may be sad enough. ",

The parasite, describing the effect of the medicine, says that the doctor wondered where such a mess had place (ἐχώρησε).

The rendering of the A.V. is not supported by usage, though Field (\"Otium Norvicense\") cites an undoubted instance of that sense from the Epistles of Alciphron, a post-Christian writer, who relates the story of a parasite returning gorged from a banquet and applying to a physician, who administered an emetic. The parasite, describing the effect of the medicine, says that the doctor wondered where such a mess had place (ἐχώρησε). For the rendering of the Rev., compare Aristophanes: πῶς οὖν οὐ χωρεῖ τοὔργον; \"How is it that the work makes no progress?\" (\"Peace,\" 472). Plutarch, ἐχώρει διὰ τῆς πόλεως ὁ λόγος, \"the word: (or report) spread (or advanced) through the city (\"Caesar,\" 712). ",
