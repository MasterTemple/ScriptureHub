In proportion as other great moral prophets have set their own standard high, they have become conscious of their own defects; and from Moses to St. Paul, from Augustine to St. Francis, the saintliest men have been the most alive to their own departures from their ideas of right. The standard of Jesus is higher than that of any other, and he appears nevertheless absolutely without need of repentance, above the power of temptation, beyond the range of conviction. True, the Jews brought a charge of madness and folly upon him immediately; but, so far from convincing him or mankind, they stand forever covered with the shame of their own incompetence to apprehend his message or himself.

He is from God; they are from God's great enemy. The moral perfection of Jesus as the God-Man is absolutely necessary to his character as \"God's Lamb,\" as \"the Only Begotten,\" \"the Son,\" and as \"the Judge,\" of the human race.
