But if circumcision is allowed, why not a deed of mercy? This is the practice and precept of your rulers.

Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite.
