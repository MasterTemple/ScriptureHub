If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came … Say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest—The whole force of this reasoning, which has been but in part seized by the commentators, lies in what is said of the two parties compared. The comparison of Himself with mere men, divinely commissioned, is intended to show (as Neander well expresses it) that the idea of a communication of the Divine Majesty to human nature was by no means foreign to the revelations of the Old Testament; but there is also a contrast between Himself and all merely human representatives of God—the one \"sanctified by the Father and sent into the world\"; the other, \"to whom the word of God (merely) came,\" which is expressly designed to prevent His being massed up with them as only one of many human officials of God. It is never said of Christ that \"the word of the Lord came to Him\"; whereas this is the well-known formula by which the divine commission, even to the highest of mere men, is expressed, as John the Baptist (Lu 3:2). The reason is that given by the Baptist himself (see on [1825]Joh 3:31). The contrast is between those \"to whom the word of God came\"—men of the earth, earthy, who were merely privileged to get a divine message to utter (if prophets), or a divine office to discharge (if judges)—and \"Him whom (not being of the earth at all) the Father sanctified (or set apart), and sent into the world,\" an expression never used of any merely human messenger of God, and used only of Himself.",

The parenthesis (Joh 10:35), \"and the Scripture cannot be broken,\" referring to the terms used of magistrates in the eighty-second Psalm, has an important bearing on the authority of the living oracles. \"The Scripture, as the expressed will of the unchangeable God, is itself unchangeable and indissoluble\" [Olshausen].
