My highest joy, therefore, is, that men cheerfully submit to the Messiah, and pay him all due honour.” Thus John was so far from regretting the advancement of Christ and his interest: as his disciples did, that he rejoiced in it, expressing his joy by an elegant, well-known, and expressive similitude. As if he had said, “Do all men come to him? It is well: whither else should they go? Has he got the throne in men’s affections? Who else should have it? It is his right. To whom should the bride be brought but to the bridegroom? The Word was made flesh, that the disparity of nature might not be a bar to the union; provision is made for the purifying of the church, that the defilement of sin might be no bar. Christ espouses the church to himself: he has the bride, for he has her love and her promise.” All that John had done in preaching and baptizing, he had done as the friend of the bridegroom, to introduce him to the bride, recommend him to her affections, prepare her for him, and in other respects do him honour and service; and now that he was come, had gained her love, and betrothed her to himself; John had what he wished for, and rejoiced. Thus faithful ministers, as friends of the bridegroom, recommend him to the affections and choice of mankind; and the espousing of souls to Christ in faith and love, is the fulfilling of their joy.",

The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness.
