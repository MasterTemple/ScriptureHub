Instead of resenting such effrontery the blessed Lord gave him in pity the last opportunity to escape, he puts the morsel sopped in the acid wine, the bread of fellowship, into his very lips, and the miscreant received it.

The kindred verb ψωμίζω, rendered feed, occurs Romans 12:20; 1 Corinthians 13:3. See also Septuagint, Psalm 79:5; Psalm 80:16. According to its etymology, the verb means to feed with morsels; and it was used by the Greeks of a nurse chewing the food and administering it to an infant. So Aristophanes: \"And one laid the child to rest, and another bathed it, and another fed (ἐψώμισεν) it\" (\"Lysistrate,\" 19, 20). This sense may possibly color the word as used in Romans 12:20 : \"If thine enemy hunger, feed (ψώμιζε) him;\" with tender care. In 1 Corinthians 13:3, the original sense appears to be emphasized: \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor (ψωμίσω).\" This idea is that of doling away in morsels. Dean Stanley says: \"Who that has witnessed the almsgiving in a Catholic monastery, or the court of a Spanish or Sicilian bishop's or archbishop's palace, where immense revenues are syringed away in farthings to herds of beggars, but must feel the force of the Apostle's half satirical ψωμίσω?\"",
