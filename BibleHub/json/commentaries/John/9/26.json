In the work of grace in the soul, though we cannot tell when, and how, and by what steps the blessed change was wrought, yet we may take the comfort, if we can say, through grace, Whereas I was blind, now I see. I did live a worldly, sensual life, but, thanks be to God, it is now otherwise with me, Eph 5:8. The unbelief of those who enjoy the means of knowledge and conviction, is indeed marvellous. All who have felt the power and grace of the Lord Jesus, wonder at the wilfulness of others who reject him. He argues strongly against them, not only that Jesus was not a sinner, but that he was of God. We may each of us know by this, whether we are of God or not. What do we? What do we for God? What do we for our souls? What do we more than others?",

Many extraordinary things happen in all ages: several things of that kind are also reported without good foundation. Therefore it would be advantageous that the True, in such cases as these, should be distinguished from the False, and the Certain from the Doubtful, by the most searching investigation which it is possible to make. But indeed the unbelieving world conceives it to be for its own interest that nothing should be altogether evident, and cleared of every difficulty. Thus, as we may see, under the pretext of its being only the result of an accumulation of tricks, the truth itself can be avoided.—V. g.",

The fact of the supernatural change is practically conceded to the obstinacy of the man's reiterated declaration, and the identification of his person by others. Westcott here differs from the majority of recent expositors, and supposes that the \"questions suggest that they were willing to believe if the facts were not decisive against belief.\" But the answer of the man proves that he saw the cunning of his antagonists, and was irritated by their conspicuous design to twist the infinite benefit that he had received into the material of a charge against his Benefactor.
