It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, for thy word's sake, is here said to be, \"for thy servant's sake,\" ver. 19. Jesus Christ is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa 42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that the promises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they are yea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all these great things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if by faith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. For this blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when we feel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.",

The words ונוראות גּדלּות are either to be subordinated in a loose connection to the clause, to define the way in which God has made Himself a name (cf. Ew. 283), or connected with שׂוּם in a pregnant sense: \"to make Thee a name, (doing) great and fearful things.\" But, on the other hand, the converse expression in Samuel, \"fearful things for Thy land, before Thy people which Thou redeemedst to Thee from Egypt (from) the nations and their gods,\" is explained in Chronicles by the interpolation of לגרשׁ: \"fearful things, to drive out before Thy people, which ... nations.\" The divergences cannot be explained by the hypothesis that both texts are mutilated, as is sufficiently shown by the contradictions into which Thenius and Bertheau have fallen in their attempts so to explain them.",
