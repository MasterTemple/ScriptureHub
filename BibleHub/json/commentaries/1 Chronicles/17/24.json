The words ונוראות גּדלּות are either to be subordinated in a loose connection to the clause, to define the way in which God has made Himself a name (cf. Ew. 283), or connected with שׂוּם in a pregnant sense: \"to make Thee a name, (doing) great and fearful things.\" But, on the other hand, the converse expression in Samuel, \"fearful things for Thy land, before Thy people which Thou redeemedst to Thee from Egypt (from) the nations and their gods,\" is explained in Chronicles by the interpolation of לגרשׁ: \"fearful things, to drive out before Thy people, which ... nations.\" The divergences cannot be explained by the hypothesis that both texts are mutilated, as is sufficiently shown by the contradictions into which Thenius and Bertheau have fallen in their attempts so to explain them.",
