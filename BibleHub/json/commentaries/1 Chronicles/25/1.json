We must take pains with our hearts to bring and keep them to this work, and to engage all that is within us in it. It is probable, Heman, Asaph, and Jeduthun were bred up under Samuel, and had their education in the schools of the prophets, of which he was the founder and president. Then they were pupils, now they come to be masters. Those that would be eminent must begin early and take time to prepare themselves. This good work, of singing God’s praises, Samuel revived and set on foot, but lived not to see it brought to the perfection in which it appears here. Solomon perfects what David began. So David perfects what Samuel began. Let each in their day do what they can for God and his church, though they cannot carry it so far as they would; when they are gone, God can out of stones raise up others, who shall build upon their foundation, and bring forth the top-stone.",
