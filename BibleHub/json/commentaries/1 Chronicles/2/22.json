Jair, inheriting his property, was his lineal representative; and accordingly this is expressly stated to be the case; for the village group of \"Havoth-Jair\" was awarded to him in that tribe, in consequence of his valiant and patriotic exploits. This arrangement, however, took place previous to the law (Nu 36:1-13), by which it was enacted that heiresses were to marry in their own tribe. But this instance of Jair shows that in the case of a man obtaining an inheritance in another tribe it required him to become thoroughly incorporated with it as a representative of the family through which the inheritance was received. He had been adopted into Manasseh, and it would never have been imagined that he was other than \"a son of Manasseh\" naturally, had not this passage given information supplementary to that of the passage in Numbers.",

Machir is distinguished from other men of the same name (cf. 2 Samuel 9:4; 2 Samuel 17:27) by the addition, father of Gilead. Segub the son of Hezron and the daughter of Machir begat Jair. This Jair, belonging on his mother's side to the tribe of Manasseh, is set down in Numbers 32:40., Deuteronomy 3:14, as a descendant of Manasseh. After Moses' victory over Og king of Bashan, Jair's family conquered the district of Argob in Bashan, i.e., in the plain of Jaulan and Hauran; and to the conquered cities, when they were bestowed upon him for a possession by Moses, the name Havvoth-jair, i.e., Jair's-life, was given. Cf. Numbers 32:41 and Deuteronomy 3:14, where this name is explained. These are the twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead, i.e., Pera.",
