But אשּׁה may be, under the circumstances, to some extent justified by the supposition that Azubah is called indefinitely \"woman,\" because Caleb had several wives. ואת־וריעות gives no suitable meaning. The explanation of Kimchi, \"with Azubah a woman, and with Jerioth,\" cannot be accepted, for only the sons of Azubah are hereafter mentioned; and the idea that the children of the other wives are not enumerated here because the list used by the chronicler was defective, is untenable: for after two wives had been named in the enumeration of the children of one of them, the mother must necessarily have been mentioned; and so, instead of בּניה, we should have had עזוּבה בּני. Hiller and J. H. Michaelis take ואת as explicative, \"with Azubah a woman, viz., with Jerioth;\" but this is manifestly only the product of exegetical embarrassment. The text is plainly at fault, and the easiest conjecture is to read, with the Peschito and the Vulgate, את אשׁתּו instead of ואת אשּׁה, \"he begat with Azubah his wife, Jerioth (a daughter); and these are her sons.\" In that case אשּׁה would be added to עזוּבה, to guard against עזוּבה being taken for acc. obj.
