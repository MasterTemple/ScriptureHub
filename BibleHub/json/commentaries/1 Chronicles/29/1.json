Those who would draw others to good, must lead the way themselves.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe palace - The original word here used is the Hebrew form of a Persian word, and generally designates the residence of the Persian monarch Esther 1:2, Esther 1:5; Esther 2:3, Esther 2:8; Nehemiah 1:1; Daniel 8:2. It is only here and in 1 Chronicles 29:19 that it is applied to the temple. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 291Ch 29:1-9. David Causes the Princes and People to Offer for the House of God.1, 2. Solomon … is yet young and tender—Though Solomon was very young when he was raised to the sovereign power, his kingdom escaped the woe pronounced (Ec 10:16). Mere childhood in a prince is not always a misfortune to a nation, as there are instances of the government being wisely administered during a minority. Solomon himself is a most illustrious proof that a young prince may prove a great blessing; for when he was but a mere child, with respect to his age, no nation was happier. His father, however, made this address before Solomon was endowed with the divine gift of wisdom, and David's reference to his son's extreme youth, in connection with the great national undertaking he had been divinely appointed to execute, was to apologize to this assembly of the estates—or, rather, to assign the reason of his elaborate preparations for the work.David, by his example and entreaty, 1 Chronicles 29:1-5, causes the princes and people to offer willingly, 1 Chronicles 27:6-9. David’s thanksgiving and prayer, 1 Chronicles 29:10-19. The people having blessed God and sacrificed, make Solomon king, 1 Chronicles 29:20-25. David’s reign and death, 1 Chronicles 29:26-30.  Is yet young and tender,  comparatively; for he was now married, as appears by comparing 2 Chronicles 9:30 12:13. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleFurthermore, David the king said unto all the congregation,.... Having finished what he had to say to Solomon, he addressed the congregation again: Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen; both to be king, and to build the temple is yet young and tender; see 1 Chronicles 22:5. and the work is great; both of governing so great a people, and of building so magnificent a temple, especially the latter is meant: for the palace is not for man; for any mortal king, though ever so great: but for the Lord God; the Targum is,\"but for the Word of the Lord God,''who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords; and therefore is to be built as with the greatest exactness, according to the pattern he himself has given, so with the greatest splendour and magnificence. Geneva Study BibleFurthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the {a} LORD God.(a) Therefore it should be excellent in all points.",
