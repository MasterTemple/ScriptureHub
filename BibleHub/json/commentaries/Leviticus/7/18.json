Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day,.... Any part of it, even the least: it shall not be accepted; as a sacrifice well pleasing to God; he will take no delight in it, or express any satisfaction therein; but, on the contrary, reject it with abhorrence: neither shall it be imputed to him that offereth it; the Targum of Jonathan adds, for merit or righteousness; it shall not be accounted a righteous action, or the offerer receive any benefit by it: it shall be an abomination; to God, the flesh being kept so long, through a sordid and stubborn disposition: and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity; it shall not be forgiven him; he shall bear the punishment of it.
