The introductory formula, \"Command the children of Israel that they fetch (bring),\" shows that the command relates to an offering on the part of the congregation, a sacrificial gift, with which Israel was to serve the Lord continually.

The offering of oil, therefore, for the preparation of the candlestick, and that of fine flour for making the loaves to be placed before Jehovah, formed part of the service in which Israel sanctified its life and labour to the Lord its God, not only at the appointed festal periods, but every day; and the law is very appropriately appended to the sanctification of the Sabbaths and feast-days, prescribed in ch. 23.
