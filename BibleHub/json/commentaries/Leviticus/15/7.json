These laws remind us that God sees all things, even those which escape the notice of men. The great gospel duties of faith and repentance are here signified, and the great gospel privileges of the application of Christ's blood to our souls for our justification, and his grace for our sanctification.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThis chapter would seem to take its place more naturally before Leviticus 12:1-8, with the subject of which it is inmediately connected. Compare especially Leviticus 12:2 with Leviticus 15:19. It stands here between two chapters, with neither of which has it any close connection. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary2. When any man hath a running issue—This chapter describes other forms of uncleanness, the nature of which is sufficiently intelligible in the text without any explanatory comment. Being the effects of licentiousness, they properly come within the notice of the legislator, and the very stringent rules here prescribed, both for the separation of the person diseased and for avoiding contamination from anything connected with him, were well calculated not only to prevent contagion, but to discourage the excesses of licentious indulgence.Matthew Poole's Commentary He that toucheth the flesh,  that is, any part of his body; the word flesh being taken otherwise here than  Leviticus 15:2; as the same word is frequently used in Scripture in differing significations in the same chapter, and sometimes in the same verse, as  Matthew 8:22. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue,.... Shall also be unclean, even any part of his flesh, or member of his body: the Jewish canon is (y), he that toucheth one that has an issue, or he that has an issue touches him, or anyone moves him that has an issue, or he moves him, defiles food, and drink, and washing vessels by touching, but not by bearing; and particularly touching the issue itself is instanced in, and such a man's spittle, &c. are defiled: shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even; as before. See Gill on Leviticus 15:5. (y) Zabim, c. 5. sect. 1, 7.
