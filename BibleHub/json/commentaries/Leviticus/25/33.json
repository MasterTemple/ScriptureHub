        "text": "The words אח ועיר are an explanatory apposition - \"and that in the town of his possession,\" - and do not mean \"whatever he had sold of his house-property or anything else in his town,\" for the Levites had no other property in the town besides the houses, but \"the house which he had sold, namely, in the town of his possession.\" This implies that the right of reversion was only to apply to the houses ceded to the Levites in their own towns, and not to houses which they had acquired in other towns either by purchase or inheritance. The singular היא is used after a subject in the plural, because the copula agrees with the object (see Ewald, 319c). As the Levites were to have no hereditary property in the land except the houses in the towns appointed for them, it was necessary that the possession of their houses should be secured to them for all time, if they were not to fall behind the other tribes.",
