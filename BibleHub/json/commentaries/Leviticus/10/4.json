It was necessary that those who suffered so signally for the transgression of the Divine institutions should be buried by men whose allegiance to God’s law was unimpeachable.",

Whenever we worship God, we come nigh unto him, as spiritual priests. This ought to make us very serious in all acts of devotion. It concerns us all, when we come nigh to God, to do every religious exercise, as those who believe that the God with whom we have to do, is a holy God.
