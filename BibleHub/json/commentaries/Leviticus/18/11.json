Such incestuous alliances Moses wisely prohibited, and his laws form the basis upon which the marriage regulations of this and other Christian nations are chiefly founded. This verse contains a general summary of all the particular prohibitions; and the forbidden intercourse is pointed out by the phrase, \"to approach to.\" In the specified prohibitions that follow, all of which are included in this general summary, the prohibited familiarity is indicated by the phrases, to \"uncover the nakedness\" [Le 18:12-17], to \"take\" [Le 18:17, 18], and to \"lie with\" [Le 18:22, 23]. The phrase in this sixth verse, therefore, has the same identical meaning with each of the other three, and the marriages in reference to which it is used are those of consanguinity or too close affinity, amounting to incestuous connections.",
