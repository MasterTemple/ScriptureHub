His head, resembling that of a calf, was adorned with a crown, and his arms were extended in the attitude of embracing those who approached him.

The fire-worshippers asserted that all children who did not undergo this purifying process would die in infancy; and the influence of this Zabian superstition was still so extensively prevalent in the days of Moses, that the divine lawgiver judged it necessary to prohibit it by an express statute.",
