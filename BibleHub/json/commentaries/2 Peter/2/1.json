Girdle the tree and it will die, and save you the trouble of felling it. But not only does Christianity never condemn slavery, though it was in dead antagonism to all its principles, and could not possibly survive where its principles were accepted, but it also takes this essentially immoral relation and finds a soul of goodness in the evil thing, which serves to illustrate the relation between God and man, between Christ and us. It does with slavery as it does with war, uses what is good in it as illustrating higher truths, and trusts to the operation, the slow operation of its deepest principles for its destruction.",

That is the picture, in another region, of the relation which Jesus Christ bears to men, though, alas, it is not the picture of the relation which men bear to Christ.

Jesus Christ’s slave is everybody else’s master. And it is the highest honour that a man can have to bow himself before that Lord, and to take His yoke upon him and learn of Him.

It is perfectly true that creation gives rights to the Creator. It is perfectly true that if we believe, as I think the New Testament teaches, that He, who before His name was Jesus was the Eternal Word of God, was the Agent of all Creation, and therefore has rights. But Christ’s heart does not care for rights of that sort. It wants something far deeper, far tenderer, far closer than any such. And He comes to us with the language that is the language of love over all the universe, as between man and woman, as between man and man, as between man and God, as between God and man, upon His lips, and says, ‘Thou must love Me, for I have died for thee.’ Yes, brother; the only ground upon which absolute possession of a man can be rested is the ground of prior absolute surrender to Him. Christ must give Himself to me before He can ask me to give myself to Him. So all that was apparently harsh in the relationship, as I have been trying to set it forth to you, melts away and disappears. No owner ever owned a slave as truly as a loving woman owns her husband, or a loving husband his wife, because the ownership is the expression of perfect love on both sides. And that is the golden bond that binds men’s souls to Christ in a submission which, the more abject it is, the more elevating it is, just because ‘He loved me, and gave Himself for me.’",

A man that is not Christ’s slave has a far worse slavery in submitting to these tyrant sins that have tempted him with the notion of how fine it is to break through these old-womanly restraints and conventional fads of a narrow morality, and to have his fling, and do as he likes and follow nature. Ay, some of you have been doing that, and could write a far better commentary than any preacher ever wrote, out of your own experience, on the great words, ‘Whilst they promised them liberty, they themselves are the slaves of corruption!’ Young men, is that true about any of you--that you came here into Manchester to a situation, and lonely lodgings, comparatively innocent, and that somebody said, ‘Oh, do not be a milksop! come along and see life,’ and you thought it was fine to shake off the shackles that your poor old mother used to try to put upon your limbs?

You can do it by word, and perhaps some of us are not guiltless in that respect. You can do it by paring down the character and office of Jesus Christ, and minimising the importance of His sacrifice from the world’s sins, and thinking of Him, not as the Owner that bought us, but as the Master that teaches us. You can do it by cowardly hiding of your colours and being too shamefaced, too sensitive to the curled lip of the man that works at the next bench, or sits at the next desk, or the student that is beside you, or somebody else whose opinion you esteem, which prevents you from saying like a man, ‘I belong to Jesus Christ, and whomsoever other people serve, as for me, I am going to serve Him.’ And you can do it, and many of you are doing it, by simply ignoring His claims, refusing to turn to Him, not yielding up your will to Him, not turning your heart to Him, not setting your dependence upon Him. Is it not a shame that men, whose hearts will glow with thankfulness when another man, especially if he is a superior, comes to them with some gift, valuable, but nothing as compared with the transcendent gift that Christ brings, will yet let Him die for them and not care anything about Him? I can understand the vehement antagonism that some people have to Christ and Christianity, but what I cannot understand is the attitude of the immense mass of people that come to services like this, who profess to believe that Jesus Christ’s love for them brought Him to the cross, and yet will not even pay the poor tribute of a little interest and a momentary inclination of heart towards Him. ‘Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by,’ that Jesus Christ died for you? He bought you for His own. Let me beseech you to ‘yield yourselves’ servants, slaves of Christ, and then you will be free, and you will hear Him say in the very depth of your hearts, ‘Henceforth I call you not slaves, but friends.’",

The same discoveries were made to the Apostles Peter, John, and Jude, who, as well as Paul, published them in their writings, that the faithful might oppose these false teachers, and confute their errors, as soon as they appeared. Peter, therefore, here records the revelation which was made to him concerning the false teachers who were to arise in the church, and concerning their destructive ways. But, lest the prospect of these great evils should grieve the faithful too much, as suggesting a fear that God had forsaken his church, he observes, by way of preface, that such a thing was not unexampled; because that, together with many true prophets, there were also many false ones in God’s ancient church, which, however, God had not therefore forsaken, but continued to superintend and take care of it.

Let us take care we give no occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the holy name whereby we are called, or to speak evil of the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. These seducers used feigned words, they deceived the hearts of their followers. Such are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides upon them. God's usual method of proceeding is shown by examples. Angels were cast down from all their glory and dignity, for their disobedience. If creatures sin, even in heaven, they must suffer in hell. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin. See how God dealt with the old world. The number of offenders no more procures favour, than their quality. If the sin be universal, the punishment shall likewise extend to all. If in a fruitful soil the people abound in sin, God can at once turn a fruitful land into barrenness, and a well-watered country into ashes. No plans or politics can keep off judgments from a sinful people. He who keeps fire and water from hurting his people, Isa 43:2, can make either destroy his enemies; they are never safe. When God sends destruction on the ungodly, he commands deliverance for the righteous. In bad company we cannot but get either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others be troubles to us. Yet it is possible for the children of the Lord, living among the most profane, to retain their integrity; there being more power in the grace of Christ, and his dwelling in them, than in the temptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, with all their terrors or allurements. In our intentions and inclinations to commit sin, we meet with strange hinderances, if we mark them When we intend mischief, God sends many stops to hinder us, as if to say, Take heed what you do. His wisdom and power will surely effect the purposes of his love, and the engagements of his truth; while wicked men often escape suffering here, because they are kept to the day of judgment, to be punished with the devil and his angels.",

Whitby, Benson, Slade, and many others, maintain that this refers to the Father as having originated the plan by which men are redeemed; and the same opinion is held, of necessity, by those who deny the doctrine of general atonement.

This also in the textplainly relates to what went before: q.d. Together with thoseprophets which were sent by God, there were likewise false prophets,such as were not sent of him.Among the people;  the people of Israel.Even as there shall be false teachers;  teachers of false doctrine,Matthew 7:15 Acts 20:29.Among you;  among you Jewish, as well as among the GentileChristians; or, among you as Christians and God’s people under the NewTestament, in opposition to the people of God under the Old.Who shall privily bring in: the Greek word signifies either tobring in slily and craftily, under specious pretences, and withoutbeing observed, Galatians 2:4 Judges 1:4; or, to bring in over and above,or beside the doctrine of the gospel, which they did not renounce; orboth may be implied.Damnable heresies;  Greek, heresies of destruction, i.e.destructive, such as lead to destruction, viz. eternal, or damnation.Even denying;  either in their words or their practices, eitherdirectly, or by consequence of their doctrines or actions; they thatprofess they know God, but contradict that profession in their lives,are said to deny him, Titus 1:16.The Lord;  either:1. God the Father, so called, Luke 2:29 Acts 4:24, &c., and probablyRevelation 6:10; nor is there any necessity, but, Judges 1:4, theword may be understood of God the Father. Or rather:2.

Denying God that bought them, or acquired them and made them his,viz. by calling them out of the darkness and gross wickedness ofthe world, to the knowledge of Christ and the gospel, and thefellowship of his church. In this general sense the word buying issometimes taken, Isaiah 55:1 Revelation 3:18. Or:2. Denying God that bought the people of Israel (whereof these falseteachers that should be among the Christian Jews were to be a part)out of Egypt, to make them his peculiar people, whereof they wouldboast themselves, and yet by their wicked practices deny that Godthat bought them; the words seem to be taken out of Deu 32:6:Is not he thy Father that hath bought thee? As likewise from2 Peter 2:5 of that chapter. Peter calls them spots,  2 Peter 2:13of this chapter.But if we understand it of Christ, which seems most probable, thesense is, either:1. That Christ bought or redeemed them, (in which sense the word issometimes taken), in that by his death he purchased the continuanceof their lives, and the staying of their execution, and rescuedthem from that present destruction which, without Christ’sinterposition, had seized on them, as it had likewise on the wholevisible creation immediately upon the apostacy of mankind. Or:2. This is spoken not only of their pretences, that they shouldprofess themselves redeemed by Christ, but in the style of thevisible church, which should judge them to be so till they declaredthe contrary by their wicked actions; and it likewise holds true ina forensical or judicial style, according to which whosoeverprofesseth himself to be redeemed by Christ, and yet denies him inhis deeds, is said to deny the Lord that bought him; it being alikeas to the greatness of the crime, whether he be really redeemed,or, professing himself to be so, denies his Redeemer.And bring upon themselves swift destruction;  shall hasten theirown destruction, it may be temporal in this world; to be sure, eternalin the other. It may be calledswift,  as coming upon themunawares, and when they think least of it, as 1 Thessalonians 5:3.",
