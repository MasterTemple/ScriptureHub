Ezekiel's posture showed reverence, but his standing up would be a posture of greater readiness and fitness for business. God will speak to us, when we stand ready to do what he commands us. As Ezekiel had not strength of his own, the Spirit entered into him. God is graciously pleased to work in us whatever he requires of us. The Holy Spirit sets us upon our feet, by inclining our wills to our duty. Thus, when the Lord calls upon the sinner to awake, and attend to the concerns of his soul, the Spirit of life and grace comes with the call. Ezekiel is sent with a message to the children of Israel. Many might treat his message with contempt, yet they should know by the event that a prophet had been sent to them.

They have rebelled against God in this, that they, like their fathers, have separated themselves from Jehovah down to this day (as regards פּשׁע בּ, see on Isaiah 1:2; and עצם היּום הזּה, as in the Pentateuch; cf. Leviticus 23:14; Genesis 7:13; Genesis 17:23, etc.).

This shamelessness springs from hardness of heart. To these hardened sinners Ezekiel is to announce the word of the Lord. Whether they hear it or not (אם־ואם, sive-sive, as in Joshua 24:15; Ecclesiastes 11:3; Ecclesiastes 12:14), they shall in any case experience that a prophet has been amongst them.

Ezekiel, therefore, is not to be prevented by fear of them and their words from delivering a testimony against their sins. The ἁπάξ λεγόμενα, סרבים and סלּונים, are not, with the older expositors, to be explained adjectively: \"rebelles et renuentes,\" but are substantives. As regards סלּון, the signification \"thorn\" is placed beyond doubt by סלּון in Ezekiel 28:24, and סרב in Aramaic does indeed denote \"refractarius;\" but this signification is a derived one, and inappropriate here. סרב is related to צרב, \"to burn, to singe,\" and means \"urtica,\" \"stinging-nettle, thistle,\" as Donasch in Raschi has already explained it. אותך is, according to the later usage, for אתּך, expressing the \"by and with of association,\" and occurs frequently in Ezekiel. Thistles and thorns are emblems of dangerous, hostile men. The thought is strengthened by the words \"to sit on (אל for על) scorpions,\" as these animals inflict a painful and dangerous wound. For the similitude of dangerous men to scorpions, cf. Sir. 26:10, and other proof passages in Bochart, Hierozoic. III. p. 551f., ed. Rosenmll. ",

            "text": ", and סרב in Aramaic does indeed denote \"refractarius;\" but this signification is a derived one, and inappropriate here. סרב is related to צרב, \"to burn, to singe,\" and means \"urtica,\" \"stinging-nettle, thistle,\" as Donasch in Raschi has already explained it. אותך is, according to the later usage, for אתּך, expressing the \"by and with of association,\" and occurs frequently in Ezekiel. Thistles and thorns are emblems of dangerous, hostile men. The thought is strengthened by the words \"to sit on (אל for על) scorpions,\" as these animals inflict a painful and dangerous wound. For the similitude of dangerous men to scorpions, cf. Sir. 26:10, and other proof passages in Bochart, Hierozoic. III. p. 551f., ed. Rosenmll. ",
