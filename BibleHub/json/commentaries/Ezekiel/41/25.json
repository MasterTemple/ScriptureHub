Under the term מקצעותיו, its corner-pieces, the horns projecting at the corners, or the horn-shaped points, are probably included, as the simple mention of the corners appears superfluous, and the horns, which were symbolically significant features in the altar, would certainly not have been wanting. There is something strange in the occurrence of וארכוּ before and along with קירות, as the length is already included in the walls, and it would not be appropriately said of the length that it was of wood. ארכוּ is therefore certainly a copyist's error for אדנוּ, ἡ βάσις αὐτοῦ (lxx), its stand or pedestal. The angel describes this altar as the \"table which stands before Jehovah\" - in perfect harmony with the epithet already applied to the sacrifices in the Pentateuch, the \"bread (לחם) of God,\" though not \"because the altar table was intended to combine the old table of shewbread and the altar of incense\" (Bttcher).
