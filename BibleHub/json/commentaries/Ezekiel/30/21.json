A man with a broken arm might be cured and fight again; but it was not to be so with Pharaoh. His arm was not to be bound with a roller (the equivalent of the modern process of putting it in \"splints\"). The Hebrew word for \"roller\" is not found elsewhere, and Ezekiel's use of it is one of the instances of his knowledge of surgery.
