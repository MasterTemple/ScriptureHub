For the application of the expression \"land of the covenant\" to the Holy Land is never met with either in the Old or New Testament, and cannot be inferred, as Hitzig supposes, from Psalm 74:20 and Daniel 11:28, or supported in any way from either the epithet \"the land of promise\" in Hebrews 11:9, or from Acts 3:25, where Peter calls the Jews \"the children of the prophets and of the covenant.\" We therefore agree with Schmieder in regarding ארץ as signifying a definite region, though one unknown to us, in the vicinity of Egypt, which was inhabited by a tribe that was independent of the Egyptians, yet bound to render help in time of war.
