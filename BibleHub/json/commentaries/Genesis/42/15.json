And with his harsh mode of addressing them, Joseph had no intention whatever to administer to his brethren \"a just punishment for their wickedness towards him,\" for his heart could not have stooped to such mean revenge; but he wanted to probe thoroughly the feelings of their hearts, \"whether they felt that they deserved the punishment of God for the sin they had committed,\" and how they felt towards their aged father and their youngest brother.",
