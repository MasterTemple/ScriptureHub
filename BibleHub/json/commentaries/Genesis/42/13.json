Not seeing his brother Benjamin, he suspected that they had made away with him, and he gave them occasion to speak of their father and brother. God, in his providence, sometimes seems harsh with those he loves, and speaks roughly to those for whom yet he has great mercy in store. Joseph settled at last, that one of them should be left, and the rest go home and fetch Benjamin. It was a very encouraging word he said to them, I fear God; as if he had said, You may be assured I will do you no wrong; I dare not, for I know there is one higher than I. With those that fear God, we may expect fair dealing.",

This little sentence, however, cannot be uttered by them, or heard by Joseph, without emotion. \"By the life of Pharaoh.\" Joseph speaks in character, and uses an Egyptian asseveration. \"Send one of you.\" This proposal is enough to strike terror into their hearts. The return of one would be a heavy, perhaps a fatal blow to their father. And how can one brave the perils of the way? They cannot bring themselves to concur in this plan. Sooner will they all go to prison, as accordingly they do. Joseph is not without a strong conviction of incumbent duty in all this. He knows he has been put in the position of lord over his brethren in the foreordination of God, and he feels bound to make this authority a reality for their moral good.",

And with his harsh mode of addressing them, Joseph had no intention whatever to administer to his brethren \"a just punishment for their wickedness towards him,\" for his heart could not have stooped to such mean revenge; but he wanted to probe thoroughly the feelings of their hearts, \"whether they felt that they deserved the punishment of God for the sin they had committed,\" and how they felt towards their aged father and their youngest brother.",
