Whatever is the matter of our rejoicing, ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. Fresh favours should quicken us to praise God for former favours; Now will I praise the Lord more and better than I have done.

He therefore recompenses her for the lack of her husband's affections by giving her children, while Rachel was barren. \"Reuben\" - behold a son. \"The Lord hath looked on my affliction.\" Leah had qualities of heart, if not of outward appearance, which commanded esteem. She had learned to acknowledge the Lord in all her ways. \"Simon\" - answer. She had prayed to the Lord, and this was her answer. \"Levi\" - union, the reconciler. Her husband could not, according to the prevailing sentiments of those days, fail to be attached to the mother of three sons. \"Judah\" - praised. Well may she praise the Lord; for this is the ancestor of the promised seed. It is remarkable that the wife of priority, but not of preference, is the mother of the seed in whom all nations are to be blessed. Levi the reconciler is the father of the priestly tribe.
