Chariots and horsemen accompany them as a guard on the way. \"The threshing-floor of Atari, or of the buck-thorn.\" This is said to be beyond Jordan. Deterred, probably, by some difficulty in the direct route, they seem to have gone round by the east side of the Salt Sea. \"A mourning of seven days.\" This is a last sad farewell to the departed patriarch. Abel-Mizraim. This name, like many in the East, has a double meaning. The word Abel no doubt at first meant mourning, though the name would be used by many, ignorant of its origin, in the sense of a meadow. \"His sons carried him.\" The main body of the procession seems to have halted beyond the Jordan, and awaited the return of the immediate relatives, who conveyed the body to its last resting-place. The whole company then returned together to Egypt.",

First servants led the way, carrying tables laden with fruit, cakes, flowers, vases of ointment, wine and other liquids, with three young geese and a calf for sacrifice, chairs and wooden tablets, napkins, and other things. Then others followed bearing daggers, bows, fans, and the mummy cases in which the deceased and his ancestors had been kept previous to burial. Next came a table of offerings, fauteuils, couches, boxes, and a chariot. After these men appeared with gold vases and more offerings. To these succeeded the bearers of a sacred boat and the mysterious eye of Osiris, as the god of stability. Placed in the consecrated boat, the hearse containing the mummy of the deceased was drawn by four oxen and by seven men, under the direction of a superintendent who regulated the march of the funeral. Behind the hearse followed the male relations and friends of the deceased, who either beat their breasts, or gave token of their sorrow by their silence and solemn step as they walked, leaning on their long sticks; and with these the procession closed.

        "text": "After the king's permission had been obtained, the corpse was carried to Canaan, attended by a large company. With Joseph there went up \"all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,\" i.e., the leading officers of the court and state, \"and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house,\" i.e., all the members of the families of Joseph, of his brethren, and of is deceased father, \"excepting only their children and flocks; also chariots and horsemen,\" as an escort for the journey through the desert, \"a very large army.\" The splendid retinue of Egyptian officers may be explained, in part from the esteem in which Joseph was held in Egypt, and in part from the fondness of the Egyptians for such funeral processions (cf. Hengst. pp. 70, 71). ",
