The prohibition applies to the eating of flesh with blood in it, whether of living animals, as is the barbarous custom in Abyssinia, or of slaughtered animals from which the blood has not been properly drained at death. This prohibition presented, on the one hand, a safeguard against harshness and cruelty; and contained, on the other, \"an undoubted reference to the sacrifice of animals, which was afterwards made the subject of command, and in which it was the blood especially that was offered, as the seat and soul of life (see note on ",

God would avenge or inflict punishment for every murder, - not directly, however, as He promised to do in the case of Cain, but indirectly by giving the command, \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,\" and thus placing in the hand of man His own judicial power. \"This was the first command,\" says Luther, \"having reference to the temporal sword. By these words temporal government was established, and the sword placed in its hand by God.\" It is true the punishment of the murderer is enjoined upon \"man\" universally; but as all the judicial relations and ordinances of the increasing race were rooted in those of the family, and grew by a natural process out of that, the family relations furnished of themselves the norm for the closer definition of the expression \"man.\" Hence the command does not sanction revenge, but lays the foundation for the judicial rights of the divinely appointed \"powers that be\" (",
