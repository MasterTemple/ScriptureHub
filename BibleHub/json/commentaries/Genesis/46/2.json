The latter identifies the speaker with the God of his father, and therefore, with the God of eternity, of creation, and of covenant. \"Fear not to go down into Mizraim.\" This implies both that it was the will of God that he should go down to Egypt, and that he would be protected there. \"A great nation.\"",

At first the prospect of paying a personal visit to Joseph had been viewed with unmingled joy. But, on calmer consideration, many difficulties appeared to lie in the way. He may have remembered the prophecy to Abraham that his posterity was to be afflicted in Egypt and also that his father had been expressly told not to go [Ge 15:13; 26:2]; he may have feared the contamination of idolatry to his family and their forgetfulness of the land of promise.
