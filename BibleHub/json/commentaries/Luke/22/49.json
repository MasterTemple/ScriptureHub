Jesus here gave an illustrious example of his own rule of doing good to those that hate us, as afterwards he did of praying for those that despitefully use us. Corrupt nature warps our conduct to extremes; we should seek for the Lord's direction before we act in difficult circumstances.

Every word is emphatic. \"Betrayest\" thou - dost thou violate all thy obligations of fidelity, and deliver thy Master up to death?

Betrayest thou \"the Son of man\" - the Messiah, the hope of the nations, the desire of all people, the world's Redeemer?
