Jesus here gave an illustrious example of his own rule of doing good to those that hate us, as afterwards he did of praying for those that despitefully use us. Corrupt nature warps our conduct to extremes; we should seek for the Lord's direction before we act in difficult circumstances. Christ was willing to wait for his triumphs till his warfare was accomplished, and we must be so too. But the hour and the power of darkness were short, and such the triumphs of the wicked always will be.",

Every word is emphatic. \"Betrayest\" thou - dost thou violate all thy obligations of fidelity, and deliver thy Master up to death? Betrayest \"thou\" - thou, so long with him, so much favored, so sure that this is the Messiah? Betrayest thou \"the Son of man\" - the Messiah, the hope of the nations, the desire of all people, the world's Redeemer? Betrayest thou the Son of man \"with a kiss\" - the sign of friendship and affection employed in a base and wicked purpose, intending to add deceit, disguise, and the prostitution of a mark of affection to the \"crime of treason?\" Every word of this must have gone to the very soul of Judas.
