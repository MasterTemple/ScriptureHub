But Christ, as he despises the contempt of the proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble. Pharisees would silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot; for as God can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham, and turn the stony heart to himself, so he can bring praise out of the mouths of children.

So joyful is the event which they celebrate - the coming of the Messiah - that it is not fit that I should attempt to impose silence on them. The expression here seems to be \"proverbial,\" and is not to be taken literally. Proverbs are designed to express the truth \"strongly,\" but are not to be taken to signify as much as if they were to be interpreted literally. The sense is, that his coming was an event of so much importance that it \"ought\" to be celebrated in some way, and \"would\" be celebrated. It would be impossible to restrain the people, and improper to attempt it. The language here is strong proverbial language to denote that fact. We are not to suppose, therefore, that our Saviour meant to say that the stones were \"conscious\" of his coming, or that God would \"make\" them speak, but only that there was \"great joy\" among the people; that it was \"proper\" that they should express it in this manner, and that it was not fit that he should attempt to repress it.
