Christ invited himself to Zaccheus' house. Wherever Christ comes he opens the heart, and inclines it to receive him. He that has a mind to know Christ, shall be known of him. Those whom Christ calls, must humble themselves, and come down. We may well receive him joyfully, who brings all good with him. Zaccheus gave proofs publicly that he was become a true convert. He does not look to be justified by his works, as the Pharisee; but by his good works he will, through the grace of God, show the sincerity of his faith and repentance. Zaccheus is declared to be a happy man, now he is turned from sin to God. Now that he is saved from his sins, from the guilt of them, from the power of them, all the benefits of salvation are his. Christ is come to his house, and where Christ comes he brings salvation with him. He came into this lost world to seek and to save it. His design was to save, when there was no salvation in any other. He seeks those that sought him not, and asked not for him.Barnes' Notes on the BibleMurmured - Found fault, complained.To be a guest - To remain with, or to be entertained by.A man that is a sinner - All publicans they regarded as great sinners, and the \"chief\" of the publicans, therefore, they regarded as especially wicked. It would appear also from Zacchaeus' confession that his character \"had been\" that of an oppressive man.

Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary7. to be guest—or lodge: something more than \"eating with\" such (Lu 15:2).a sinner—that was one but a minute ago, but now is not. This mighty change, however, was all unknown to them. But they shall know it presently. \"Sinner\" would refer both to his office, vile in the eyes of a Jew, and to his character, which it is evident was not good.Matthew Poole's Commentary All here must not be taken for every individual person, that is not to be presumed either of all the inhabitants of Jericho, or, much less, of all that were in Christ’s company: amongst others Mary Magdalene was at this time in his company, who had no reason to murmur at that. But of what sort of people were these murmurers? The voice is the voice of Pharisees, who had often quarrelled at Christ for this, and of their disciples; for there were multitudes of the Jews that had drunk in the superstitions of that faction, and were more afraid of keeping company with sinners, than themselves being so; of having fellowship with their excommunicates in their houses, than of having fellowship with their, or greater, works of darkness. Our Saviour had before answered this cavil, he will now come to show them they were mistaken in the man; that he whom they counted a sinner, was a better man than themselves generally were. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd when they saw it,.... The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions read, \"when they all saw this\"; that is, as the Persic version, rather paraphrasing than translating, says, \"the men and the multitude that were with him\"; the \"pharisaical\" sort, the priests and Levites, of which there were great numbers in Jericho;  See Gill on Luke 10:31. They all murmured; as the Scribes and Pharisees did, at his eating with publicans and sinners, Luke 15:2. Saying, that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner; a notorious one, an abandoned profligate creature; one of the worst of sinners, as being a publican, and the chief of them; who had amassed vast riches to himself, by extortion and oppression; and they thought it was not agreeable to the character of an holy man, and a venerable prophet, which Christ bore, to go into such a man's house, eat at his table; and have familiar conversation with him; see Matthew 9:10. Geneva Study Bible{2} And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.(2) The world forsakes the grace of God, and yet is unwilling that it should be bestowed upon others.",
