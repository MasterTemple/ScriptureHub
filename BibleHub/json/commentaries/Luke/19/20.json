Those that are called to Christ, he furnishes with gifts needful for their business; and from those to whom he gives power, he expects service. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, 1Co 12:7. And as every one has received the gift, so let him minister the same, 1Pe 4:10. The account required, resembles that in the parable of the talents; and the punishment of the avowed enemies of Christ, as well as of false professors, is shown. The principal difference is, that the pound given to each seems to point out the gift of the gospel, which is the same to all who hear it; but the talents, distributed more or less, seem to mean that God gives different capacities and advantages to men, by which this one gift of the gospel may be differently improved.",

So many people employ their talents, their learning, their property, their influence. They \"have\" them; they \"keep\" them; but they never \"use\" them in the service of the Lord Jesus; and, in regard to their influence on the church or the world, it would be the same if God had never conferred on them these talents.

The third falls altogether into a different catalogue. He is a believer who has not found the state of grace offered by Jesus so brilliant as he hoped; a legal Christian, who has not tasted grace, and knows nothing of the gospel but its severe morality. It seems to him that the Lord gives very little to exact so much. \"Surely,\" such a one argues, \"the Lord should be satisfied with us if we abstain from doing ill, from squandering our talent.\" The Master's answer is singularly to the point: \"The more thou knowest that I am austere, the more thou shouldest have tried to satisfy me!\" The Christian who lacks the experience of grace ought to be the most anxious of workers.
