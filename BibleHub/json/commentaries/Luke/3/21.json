Eph.,' 18, beginning of the second century) writes, \"He was baptized that, by his submission to the rite, he might purify the water.\" Jerome, in the same strain, says, \"He did not so much get cleansing from baptism, as impart cleansing to it.\" It would seem that Jesus, in submitting to the rite himself, did it with the intention of sanctifying the blessed sacrament in the future.
