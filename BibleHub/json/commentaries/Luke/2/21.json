Yet in this naming of Him \"Saviour,\" in the act of circumcising Him, which was a symbolical and bloody removal of the body of sin, we have a tacit intimation that they \"had need\"—as John said of His Baptism—rather to be circumcised by Him \"with the circumcision made without hands, in the putting off of the body [of the sins] of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ\" (Col 2:11), and that He only \"suffered it to be so, because thus it became Him to fulfil all righteousness\" (Mt 3:15). Still the circumcision of Christ had a profound bearing on His own work—by few rightly apprehended. For since \"he that is circumcised is a debtor to do the whole law\" (Ga 5:3), Jesus thus bore about with Him in His very flesh the seal of a voluntary obligation to do the whole law—by Him only possible in the flesh since the fall. And as He was \"made under the law\" for no ends of His own, but only \"to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons\" (Ga 4:4, 5), the obedience to which His circumcision pledged Him was a redeeming obedience—that of a \"Saviour.\" And, finally, as \"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law\" by \"being made a curse for us\" (Ga 3:13), we must regard Him, in His circumcision, as brought under a palpable pledge to be \"obedient unto death, even the death of the cross\" (Php 2:8).",
