If she could not afford a lamb, the mother had to bring another turtle dove or young pigeon; and, if even this was beyond her means, then a portion of fine flour, but without the usual fragrant accompaniments of oil and frankincense, as it represented a sin offering (Le 12:6-8; 5:7-11). From the intermediate offering of \"a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons,\" we gather that Joseph and the Virgin were in poor circumstances (2Co 8:9), though not in abject poverty. Being a first-born male, they \"bring him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord.\" All such had been claimed as \"holy to the Lord,\" or set apart to sacred uses, in memory of the deliverance of the first-born of Israel from destruction in Egypt, through the sprinkling of blood (Ex 13:2). In lieu of these, however, one whole tribe, that of Levi, was accepted, and set apart to occupations exclusively sacred (Nu 3:11-38); and whereas there were two hundred seventy-three fewer Levites than first-born of all Israel on the first reckoning, each of these first-born was to be redeemed by the payment of five shekels, yet not without being \"presented (or brought) unto the Lord,\" in token of His rightful claim to them and their service (Nu 3:44-47; 18:15, 16). It was in obedience to this \"law of Moses,\" that the Virgin presented her babe unto the Lord, \"in the east gate of the court called Nicanor's Gate, where she herself would be sprinkled by the priest with the blood of her sacrifice\" [Lightfoot]. By that Babe, in due time, we were to be redeemed, \"not with corruptible things as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ\" (1Pe 1:18, 19), and the consuming of the mother's burnt offering, and the sprinkling of her with the blood of her sin offering, were to find their abiding realization in the \"living sacrifice\" of the Christian mother herself, in the fulness of a \"heart sprinkled from an evil conscience,\" by \"the blood which cleanseth from all sin.\"",
