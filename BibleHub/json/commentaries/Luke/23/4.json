They probably mentioned Galilee, either to alarm Pilate, the Galileans being notorious for sedition and rebellion; or to influence him, knowing that he was prejudiced against the people of that country. Pilate, hearing of Galilee, asked whether the prisoner came out of that country? and, being informed that he did, he ordered him to be carried away immediately to Herod, who was then in Jerusalem. Perhaps he supposed that the prince, in whose dominions the sedition was said to have been raised, could be a better judge of the affair than he. Moreover, as Herod was a Jew, expert in the religion and customs of his country, the governor imagined, that he might have had influence with the priests to desist. Or, if at their solicitation he should condemn Jesus, Pilate thought to escape the guilt and infamy of putting an innocent person to death. He might also propose to regain Herod’s friendship, formerly lost, perhaps by encroaching on his privileges. But whatever was his motive, the king, who had of a long time desired to see Jesus, rejoiced at this opportunity; for he hoped he should have the pleasure of seeing him work some miracle or other. Nevertheless, because Herod had disregarded the admonitions of John the Baptist, and had been guilty of the heinous crime of putting him to death, Jesus, liberal as he was of his miracles to the poor and afflicted, would not work them to gratify the curiosity of a tyrant, nor so much as answered one of his questions, though, ",
