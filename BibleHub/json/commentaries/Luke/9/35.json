In our greatest glories on earth, let us remember that in this world we have no continuing city. What need we have to pray to God for quickening grace, to make us lively! Yet that the disciples might be witnesses of this sign from heaven, after awhile they became awake, so that they were able to give a full account of what passed. But those know not what they say, that talk of making tabernacles on earth for glorified saints in heaven.",

While Jesus was praying, or perhaps after he closed, they fell asleep. \"While\" they were sleeping his countenance was changed, and Moses and Elias appeared.
