It is for the glory of God if we follow Jesus, as those will do whose eyes are opened. We must praise God for his mercies to others, as well as for mercies to ourselves.

Or, in the words of Dr. Morrison, \"the case seems to have begun as he entered into the city, but it culminated in all likelihood as he departed.\" A later explanation, apparently preferred by Godet and Farrar, is that, as Josephus and Eusebius distinguish between the old and the new Jericho - the old town on the ancient site, and the new Herodian town which had sprung up at a little distance from it - the blind man might, according to some traditions, have been healed as Jesus was leaving old Jericho; according to others, as he was entering the new town. The fact of SS. Mark and Luke only mentioning one blind man is easily explained. There was one evidently (as we shall suggest further on), a well-known character in Christian story - Bartimaeus.
