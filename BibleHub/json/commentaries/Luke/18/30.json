Many who are loth to leave Christ, yet do leave him. After a long struggle between their convictions and their corruptions, their corruptions carry the day. They are very sorry that they cannot serve both; but if one must be quitted, it shall be their God, not their wordly gain. Their boasted obedience will be found mere outside show; the love of the world in some form or other lies at the root. Men are apt to speak too much of what they have left and lost, of what they have done and suffered for Christ, as Peter did. But we should rather be ashamed that there has been any regret or difficulty in doing it.",

This He calls \"manifold more\"—\"an hundredfold more\"—than what they sacrificed. Our Lord was Himself the first to exemplify this new adjustment of His own relationships. (See on [1689]Mt 12:49, 50; and [1690]2Co 6:14-18.) But this \"with persecutions\"; for how could such a transfer take place without the most cruel wrenches to flesh and blood? but the persecution would haply follow them into their new and higher circle, breaking that up too!

In this sense certainly the promise has been illustriously fulfilled [Calvin, Grotius, Lightfoot, &c.].
