Not, What shall become of such and such? But, What shall I do, and what will become of me? Strive to enter in at the strait gate. This is directed to each of us; it is, Strive ye. All that will be saved, must enter in at the strait gate, must undergo a change of the whole man. Those that would enter in, must strive to enter. Here are awakening considerations, to enforce this exhortation. Oh that we may be all awakened by them! They answer the question, Are there few that shall be saved? But let none despond either as to themselves or others, for there are last who shall be first, and first who shall be last.

Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary28, 29. (See Mt 8:11, 12). Also see on [1663]Mt 13:42.Matthew Poole's Commentary This is a sentence which our Saviour often made use of, and not always to the same purpose. See Poole on \"Matthew 19:30\". See Poole on \"Matthew 20:16\". See Poole on \"Mark 10:31\". As to the sense of them here, it is plain. Our Saviour here foretells the conversion of the Gentiles; but yet I do not take the Gentiles to be all who are intended under the notion of the last,  but divers others also. Men who, both in their opinion of themselves, and in reality with respect to privilege, are the first,  whether in respect of gifts, or office, or the means of grace, or profession, will many of them be the last,  that is, furthest off from the kingdom of God; and many who are the last,  upon these accounts will in the day of judgment be first, that is, appear so, as having more of the favour of God, and be so, taken to heaven, when the others shall be cast to hell, Matthew 11:20-24. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd behold, there are last which shall be first,.... The Gentiles, the most mean and abject, afar from God, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, called last of all; these shall be first, and sit down among patriarchs and prophets, men of the first rank here on earth, in the kingdom of heaven, and enjoy the same glory and happiness with them: and there are first which shall be last: the Jews, who were first the visible professing people of God, to whom the oracles of God, and outward privileges and ordinances were given; who had the Messiah first sent to them, and the Gospel first preached among them; these shall be last, be rejected and despised, and shut out of the kingdom of heaven, they thought themselves heirs of, and expected to enjoy; see Matthew 19:30.
