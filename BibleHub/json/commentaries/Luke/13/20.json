The parable of \"the Leaven\" sets forth, perhaps, rather the inward growth of the kingdom, while \"the Mustard Seed\" seems to point chiefly to the outward. It being a woman's work to knead, it seems a refinement to say that \"the woman\" here represents the Church, as the instrument of depositing the leaven. Nor does it yield much satisfaction to understand the \"three measures of meal\" of that threefold division of our nature into \"spirit, soul, and body,\" (alluded to in 1Th 5:23) or of the threefold partition of the world among the three sons of Noah (Ge 10:32), as some do. It yields more real satisfaction to see in this brief parable just the all-penetrating and assimilating quality of the Gospel, by virtue of which it will yet mould all institutions and tribes of men, and exhibit over the whole earth one \"Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.\" (See on [1658]Re 11:15).",
