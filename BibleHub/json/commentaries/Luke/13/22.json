And is the Christian Church in general in a much better state than the Jewish Church was then in? Can professing Christians enter heaven without being conformed in principle and practice to the doctrine of Christ, any more than the Jews could enter it without a conformity to that of Moses and the prophets? But our Lord’s exhortation here implies another thing, namely, that the few that do enter in at this gate, do not enter without much opposition and difficulty. For this reason, also, he terms the gate ",

It being a woman's work to knead, it seems a refinement to say that \"the woman\" here represents the Church, as the instrument of depositing the leaven. Nor does it yield much satisfaction to understand the \"three measures of meal\" of that threefold division of our nature into \"spirit, soul, and body,\" (alluded to in 1Th 5:23) or of the threefold partition of the world among the three sons of Noah (Ge 10:32), as some do. It yields more real satisfaction to see in this brief parable just the all-penetrating and assimilating quality of the Gospel, by virtue of which it will yet mould all institutions and tribes of men, and exhibit over the whole earth one \"Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.\" (See on [1658]Re 11:15).",
