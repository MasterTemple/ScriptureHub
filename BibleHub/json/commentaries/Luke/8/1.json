Still I cannot but observe, that preaching the gospel, and thereby showing the glad tidings of salvation, (the principal means to bring men to the kingdom of God, whether that in this life, or the kingdom of glory in the life which is to come), was Christ’s great work. His working miracles was but subservient to this, and for the confirmation of the doctrine which he preached; hence, when a people showed a contempt of his word, he refused to work any miracles before them. How any one can dream, that either praying, or government, or administering sacraments, or any thing else, should be more the work of a minister of Christ than preaching, may justly amaze any thinking soul that ever read the gospel. Christ went every where about preaching, and the twelve were with him,  sometimes hearing, (as his disciples), sometimes preaching; some women also were with him, such as had been healed of evil spirits and other diseases. Mary Magdalene was one, out of whom he had cast seven devils, that is, many devils. Most think she had her name from Magdala, a city in Galilee, where she was bred, or dwelt. It is a great error to think she was the Mary mentioned John 11:1-57, the sister of Lazarus; she lived in Bethany, near to Jerusalem. Yet it is plain from Mark 16:1-20 that she was at Jerusalem at the time of Christ’s death and resurrection; but so were many that followed him from Galilee, Mark 15:41 Luke 23:49. And Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward. Christ hath his elect in all places, his Joseph in Pharaoh’s court, his Daniel and three children in Nebuchadnezzar’s court, his saints in Nero’s household, Philippians 4:22, his Joanna in Herod’s family. This was that Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee, he who put John the Baptist to death, and himself with his soldiers mocked Christ; possibly his steward was as bad, but his wife was one that followed Christ, knowing that though her husband had power over her body, he had none over her soul. And they ministered to him of their substance. They were not ashamed to be seen following of Christ, though doubtless they met with scoffs enough. Nor were they ashamed to be reproached for their former failing; nor was Christ, because of their former lives, or the life of some of them, to have them following him. It is a glory to Christ, and to the church of Christ, to have great sinners brought to him, and brought into it; the only shame is to such as, being in the church, or pretending at least to be Christians, are debauchees still. Christ did not give himself for a people that were pure and holy, without spot or wrinkle, but that he might sanctify them and cleanse them, with the washing of water by the word,  Ephesians 5:25-27. Following Christ they ministered to him. This was according to Christ’s doctrine, Matthew 10:10, and his apostles after him, 1 Corinthians 9:11 2 Corinthians 8:9 Galatians 6:6. Some of them might be virgins, some widows, some wives, who had an allowance for themselves from their husbands; however, it could be no robbery to give of what was their husbands’ to him who was the Lord of all, which either their husbands or they possessed. Nor was Christ ashamed to live upon the baskets of others, while he was providing spiritual food for the souls of all, 2 Corinthians 8:9. ",
