But let us beware of spiritual pride, which has been the destruction of many. Our Lord rejoiced at the prospect of the salvation of many souls. It was fit that particular notice should be taken of that hour of joy; there were few such, for He was a man of sorrows: in that hour in which he saw Satan fall, and heard of the good success of his ministers, in that hour he rejoiced. He has ever resisted the proud, and given grace to the humble. The more simply dependent we are on the teaching, help, and blessing of the Son of God, the more we shall know both of the Father and of the Son; the more blessed we shall be in seeing the glory, and hearing the words of the Divine Saviour; and the more useful we shall be made in promoting his cause.",

(2) There it was merely \"at that time\" (or season) that He spoke thus, meaning with a general reference to the rejection of His gospel by the self-sufficient; here, \"In that hour Jesus said,\" with express reference probably to the humble class from which He had to draw the Seventy, and the similar class that had chiefly welcomed their message. \"Rejoice\" is too weak a word. It is \"exulted in spirit\"—evidently giving visible expression to His unusual emotions; while, at the same time, the words \"in spirit\" are meant to convey to the reader the depth of them. This is one of those rare cases in which the veil is lifted from off the Redeemer's inner man, that, angel-like, we may \"look into it\" for a moment (1Pe 1:12). Let us gaze on it with reverential wonder, and as we perceive what it was that produced that mysterious ecstasy, we shall find rising in our hearts a still rapture—\"Oh, the depths!\"",
