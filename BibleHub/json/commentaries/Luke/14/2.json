The \"dropsy\" acquires different names, from the different parts it afflicts, or the different parts the waters are collected in; that of the \"abdomen\", or lower belly, called simply and absolutely \"dropsy\", is particularly denominated \"ascites\"; that of the whole habit of the body, \"anasarca\", or \"leucophlegmatia\"; that of the head, \"hydrocephalus\"; that of the scrotum, \"hydrocele\".---There is also a species of this disease, supposed to be caused instead of water, by a collection of wind, called \"tympanites\"; and by Hippocrates, the \"dry dropsy\": we also meet with dropsies of the breast, pericardium, uterus, ovaries, &c. The causes of dropsies in general, are whatever may obstruct the serous part of the blood, so as to make it stagnate in the vessels; or burst the vessels themselves, so as to let the blood out among the membranes; or weaken and relax the tone of the vessels; or this the blood, and make it watery; or lessen perspiration. These causes are various, viz. sometimes acute diseases, scirrhous tumours of any of the more noble viscera, excessive evacuations, particularly haemorrhages, hard drinking, &c. The \"ascites\", or \"water dropsy\" of the \"abdomen\", is the most usual case, and what we particularly call the \"dropsy\": its symptoms are tumours, first of the feet and legs, and afterwards of the \"abdomen.\" which keep continually growing; and if the belly be struck or shook, there is heard a quashing of water: add to this, three other attendants, viz. a dyspnoea, intense thirst, and sparing urine; with which may be numbered heaviness, listlessness, costiveness, a light fever, and an emaciation of the body (i). Such we must suppose to be the case of this man, and that he was now in such a condition, as to be thought incurable. ",
