It may be noted that in accordance with the characteristic sternness of ancient education, both words have a tinge of severity in them.

In this, as in other cases, Christianity gradually softened this stern authority of the father—so strikingly exemplified in the old Roman law—by the idea suggested in the addition of the phrase “of the Lord.” The children belong not to the parent only, but to Christ, taken into His arms in baptism, and sealed as His little ones.

Many set their children against religion; but this does not excuse the children's disobedience, though it may be awfully occasion it.

So Plato: \"Education (παιδεία) is the constraining and directing of youth toward that right reason which the law affirms, and which the experience of the best of our elders has agreed to be truly right\" (\"Laws,\" 659). In scriptural usage another meaning has come into it and its kindred verb παιδεύειν, which recognizes the necessity of correction or chastisement to thorough discipline. So Leviticus 26:18; Psalm 6:1; Isaiah 53:5; Hebrews 12:5-8. In Acts 7:22 παιδεύω occurs in the original classical sense: \"Moses was instructed (ἐπαιδεύθη) in all the wisdom,\" etc. The term here covers all the agencies which contribute to moral and spiritual training. Discipline is better than Rev., chastening. Νουθεσία admonition occurs only here, 1 Corinthians 10:11, and Titus 3:10. The kindred verb νουθετέω to warn or admonish, is found only in Paul's letters, with the single exception of Acts 20:31 (see note). Its distinctive feature is training by word of mouth, as is shown by its classical usage in connection with words meaning to exhort or teach. Xenophon uses the phrase νουθετικοὶ λόγοι admonitory words. Yet it may include monition by deed. Thus Plato, speaking of public instruction in music, says that the spectators were kept quiet by the admonition of the wand (ῥάβδου νουθέτησις, \"Laws,\" 700). He also uses the phrase πληγαῖς νουθετεῖν to admonish with blows. It includes rebuke, but not necessarily. Trench happily illustrates the etymological sense (νοῦς the mind, τίθημι to put): \"Whatever is needed to cause the monition to be laid to heart.\" Admonition is a mode of discipline, so that the two words nurture and admonition stand related as general and special.",
