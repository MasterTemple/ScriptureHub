Ministers did not give themselves. Compare with the list here, 1Co 12:10, 28. As the apostles, prophets, and evangelists were special and extraordinary ministers, so \"pastors and teachers\" are the ordinary stated ministers of a particular flock, including, probably, the bishops, presbyters, and deacons. Evangelists were itinerant preachers like our missionaries, as Philip the deacon (Ac 21:8); as contrasted with stationary \"pastors and teachers\" (2Ti 4:5). The evangelist founded the Church; the teacher built it up in the faith already received. The \"pastor\" had the outward rule and guidance of the Church: the bishop. As to revelation, the \"evangelist\" testified infallibly of the past; the \"prophet,\" infallibly of the future. The prophet derived all from the Spirit; the evangelist, in the special case of the Four, recorded matter of fact, cognizable to the senses, under the Spirit's guidance. No one form of Church polity as permanently unalterable is laid down in the New Testament though the apostolical order of bishops, or presbyters, and deacons, superintended by higher overseers (called bishops after the apostolic times), has the highest sanction of primitive usage. In the case of the Jews, a fixed model of hierarchy and ceremonial unalterably bound the people, most minutely detailed in the law. In the New Testament, the absence of minute directions for Church government and ceremonies, shows that a fixed model was not designed; the general rule is obligatory as to ceremonies, \"Let all things be done decently and in order\" (compare Article XXXIV, Church of England); and that a succession of ministers be provided, not self-called, but \"called to the work by men who have public authority given unto them in the congregation, to call and send ministers into the Lord's vineyard\" [Article XXIII]. That the \"pastors\" here were the bishops and presbyters of the Church, is evident from Ac 20:28; 1Pe 5:1, 2, where the bishops' and presbyters' office is said to be \"to feed\" the flock. The term, \"shepherd\" or \"pastor,\" is used of guiding and governing and not merely instructing, whence it is applied to kings, rather than prophets or priests (Eze 34:23; Jer 23:4). Compare the names of princes compounded of \"pharnas,\" Hebrew, \"pastor,\" Holophernes, Tis-saphernes (compare Isa 44:28).",
