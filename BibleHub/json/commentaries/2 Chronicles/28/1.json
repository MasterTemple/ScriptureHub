(Comp. 2 Kings 16)PRELIMINARY NOTICES OF THE LENGTH AND CHARACTER OF THE REIGN (2Chronicles 28:1-4).(1) Ahaz was twenty years old.—The verse is identical with 2Kings 16:2; LXX., Syriac, and Arabic, “twenty and five.” (See 2Chronicles 29:1.)The Lord.—Add his God. So some MSS. and Syriac; also Kings. The Assyrian monuments call Ahaz Yahuhazi, i.e., Jehoahaz, of which Ahaz may be a familiar abridgment. (Comp. Nathan, Jonathan.)Benson Commentary2 Chronicles 28:1-4. He did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord —Nay, he did a great deal that was wrong, very wrong, and that toward God, toward his own soul, and toward his people. He walked in the way of the revolted Israelites, and the devoted Canaanites; made molten images and worshipped them, contrary to the second commandment; nay, he made them for Baalim, contrary to the first. He forsook the temple of the Lord, and sacrificed, and burned incense on the hills, and under every green tree, in imitation of the neighbouring idolaters. And, to complete his wickedness, as one perfectly divested of all natural affection, as well as of all religion, and perfectly devoted to the service and interest of the great enemy of mankind, he burned his children in the fire to Moloch — Not thinking it enough to dedicate them to that infernal fiend, by causing them to pass through the fire. Such is the absolute sway which the prince of the power of the air sometimes exercises over the children of disobedience! But of his true character and complicated wickedness, see notes on 2 Kings 16:1-4; 2 Kings 16:10-18. ÷2Ch 28:1-27 A.M. 3263. — B.C. 741.Ahaz reigns ill, 2 Chronicles 28:1-4. Is smitten by the Syrians and Israelites, 2 Chronicles 28:5-8; who send back the captives they had taken, 2 Chronicles 28:9-15. Ahaz sends for help to the king of Assyria, but in vain, 2 Chronicles 28:16-21. Yet he continues in idolatry, 2 Chronicles 28:22-25; and dies, 2 Chronicles 28:26, 2 Chronicles 28:27.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary28:1-27 The wicked reign of Ahaz in Judah. - Israel gained this victory because God was wroth with Judah, and made them the rod of his indignation. He reminds them of their own sins. It ill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God, if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it be remembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellow man, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with the word of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law of love and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage, without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should do unto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, they grow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release the prisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who will not humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled by his judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those are wicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespass yet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. But no marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when they mistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress of wickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon a sinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThis chapter is supplemental in character, The writer seems to assume that the narrative of Kings (marginal reference) is known, and is mainly anxious to add points which the author of that narrative has omitted. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 282Ch 28:1-21. Ahaz, Reigning Wickedly, Is Afflicted by the Syrians.1-4. Ahaz was twenty years old—(See on [459]2Ki 16:1-4). This prince, discarding the principles and example of his excellent father, early betrayed a strong bias to idolatry. He ruled with an arbitrary and absolute authority, and not as a theocratic sovereign: he not only forsook the temple of God, but embraced first the symbolic worship established in the sister kingdom, and afterwards the gross idolatry practised by the Canaanites.Ahaz reigning ill, 2 Chronicles 28:1-4, is smitten by the Syrians, and by the Israelites, 2 Chronicles 28:5-7, who carry away captives; which, by the advice of a prophet, they return, 2 Chronicles 28:8-15. Ahaz sendeth to the king of Assyria for help against the Philistines and Edomites, but obtainth none, 2 Chronicles 28:16-21. His great idolatry, 2 Chronicles 28:22-25. he dieth, and Hezekiah is king, 2 Chronicles 28:26,27.  No text from Poole on this verse. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAhaz was twenty years old when he began to reign,.... These verses are much the same with 2 Kings 16:2, only in 2 Chronicles 28:2 it is said, he made also molten images for Baalim; the several Baals or idols of the nations round about, as well as served Jeroboam's calves; see Judges 2:11, and he is said in 2 Chronicles 28:3, to burn incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom; to Molech, the god of the Ammonites, who was worshipped there.  See Gill on 2 Kings 16:2, 2 Kings 16:3, 2 Kings 16:4. Geneva Study BibleAhaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:",
