        "text": "XV.ASA’S REFORMATION OF RELIGION.(a) ADDRESS OF THE PROPHET AZARIAH BEN ODED (2Chronicles 15:1-7).This section also is peculiar to the Chronicle.(1) And the Spirit of God.—Literally, And Azariah son of Oded, there fell upon him spirit of God (i.e., a holy inspiration). The prophet is unknown, except from this chapter. The name Oded comprises the same radical letters as Iddo (2Chronicles 9:29; 2Chronicles 12:15); but whether the same prophet or another be meant, is beyond decision.Benson Commentary2 Chronicles 15:1-2. The Spirit of God came upon Azariah — Both to instruct him what to say, and to enable him to say it plainly and boldly. And he went out to meet Asa — Now returning victorious, with his army, from the war with the Ethiopians. And he said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa and all Judah, &c. — He does not come out to meet them in order to compliment them, or congratulate their success, but to excite them to their duty: which is the proper business of God’s ministers, even with princes and the greatest men. The Lord is with you — To defend you against all your enemies, as ye now have seen, and may hereafter expect; while ye be with him — While ye persist in that good course upon which you have entered. For the continuance of his presence with you depends upon your perseverance in the way of your duty. If you seek him he will be found of you — If you sincerely desire his favour, and seek it in the way he hath appointed, especially by prayer and supplication, and complying with his will in all things, you shall obtain it: but if you forsake him — And his commandments and ordinances of worship; he will forsake you — And then you will be undone, and will find that your present triumphs were no security to you. Let not this victory, then, make you presumptuous, or self- confident: for you are upon your good behaviour; and if you leave God, he will leave and destroy you, after he has done you all this good.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary15:1-19 The people make a solemn covenant with God. - The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa had not courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance and acceptance. He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. The people, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each for himself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiring after him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of our religion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all the heart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowed and shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery.Barnes' Notes on the BibleOded is by some identified with Iddo, the prophet and historian of the two preceding reigns. In the Hebrew the two names differ very slightly. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 152Ch 15:1-15. Judah Makes a Solemn Covenant with God.1. Azariah the son of Oded—This prophet, who is mentioned nowhere else, appears at this stage of the sacred story in the discharge of an interesting mission. He went to meet Asa, as he was returning from his victorious pursuit of the Ethiopians, and the congratulatory address here recorded was publicly made to the king in presence of his army.Asa, with Judah and many of Israel, moved by Azariah the prophet, renew a solemn covenant with God, 2 Chronicles 15:1-15. He removeth Maachah his mother for her idolatry; bringeth the hallowed things again into the temple; and enjoyeth a long peace, 2 Chronicles 15:16-19.  No text from Poole on this verse. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded,.... The same with Iddo, as Hillerus (h) thinks; and some suppose this to be the name of the son as well as the father, but called Azariah, to distinguish him from him, see 2 Chronicles 15:8 on whom came, as the Targum, the spirit of prophecy, instructing him what to say to Asa; and the Jews say (i) he is the same with Iddo, and he the same that was sent to Jeroboam, to reprove him for the altar he built. (h) Onomastic, Sacr. p. 458. (i) In Hieron. Trad. Heb. in Paralipom. fol. 84. L. & 85. A. Geneva Study BibleAnd the Spirit of God came upon {a} Azariah the son of Oded:(a) Who was called Obed as his father was, 2Ch 15:8.",

To impress the people deeply with this truth, Azariah draws a powerful picture of the times when a people is forsaken by God, when peace and security in social intercourse disappear, and the terrors of civil war prevail. Opinions as to the reference intended in this portrayal of the dreadful results of defection from God have been from antiquity very much divided. Tremell. and Grot., following the Targ., take the words to refer to the condition of the kingdom of the ten tribes at that time; others think they refer to the past, either to the immediately preceding period of the kingdom of Judah, to the times of the defection under Rehoboam and Abijah, before Asa had suppressed idolatry (Syr., Arab., Raschi), or to the more distant past, the anarchic period of the judges, from Joshua's death, and that of the high priest Phinehas, until Eli and Samuel's reformation (so especially Vitringa, de synag. vet. p. 335ff.). Finally, still others (Luther, Clericus, Budd., etc.) interpret the words as prophetic, as descriptive of the future, and make them refer either to the unquiet times under the later idolatrous kings, to the times of the Assyrian or Chaldean exile (Kimchi), or to the condition of the Jews since the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans up till the present day. Of these three views, the first, that which takes the reference to be to the present, i.e., the state of the kingdom of the ten tribes at that time, is decidedly erroneous; for during the first thirty years of the existence of that kingdom no such anarchic state of things existed as is portrayed in vv. 5 and 6, and still less could a return of the ten tribes to the Lord at that time be spoken of (",
