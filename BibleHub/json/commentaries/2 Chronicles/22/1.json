Syriac: “For all the elder the troop had destroyed them; for the Arabs came and destroyed the camp of Israel.”Benson CommentaryA.M. 3119. — B.C. 885.Ahaziah’s wicked reign, 2 Chronicles 22:1-4. Being confederate with Joram, he is slain by Jehu, 2 Chronicles 22:5-9. Athaliah destroys the seed royal, and usurps the kingdom, 2 Chronicles 22:10-12.2 Chronicles 22:1. The band of men had slain all the eldest — A cruel sort of men, who came along with the Arabians, and therefore slew those whom the Arabians had spared, and only carried into captivity. Or the Philistines may be intended, who accompanied the Arabians in this expedition, (2 Chronicles 21:16,) and who lived near the kingdom of Judah, and therefore wished to destroy all the branches of the royal family, lest, if any of them survived, they should afterward gain strength, and revenge themselves upon them for plundering their country, and carrying so many of the seed royal away captive.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary22:1-12 The reign of Ahaziah, Athaliah destroys the royal family. - The counsel of the ungodly ruins many young persons when they are setting out in the world. Ahaziah gave himself up to be led by evil men. Those who advise us to do wickedly, counsel us to our destruction; while they pretend to be friends, they are our worst enemies. See and dread the mischief of bad company. If not the infection, yet let the destruction be feared, Re 18:4. We have here, a wicked woman endeavouring to destroy the house of David, and a good woman preserving it. No word of God shall fall to the ground. The whole truth of the prophecies that the Messiah was to come from David, and thereby the salvation of the world, appeared to be now hung upon the brittle thread of the life of a single infant, to destroy whom was the interest of the reigning power. But God had purposed, and vain were the efforts of earth and hell.Barnes' Notes on the BibleNot in the sepulchres of the kings - Compare the similar treatment of Joash 2 Chronicles 24:25 and Ahaz 2 Chronicles 28:27. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 222Ch 22:1-9. Ahaziah Succeeding Jehoram, Reigns Wickedly.1. the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah … king—or Jehoahaz (2Ch 21:17). All his older brothers having been slaughtered by the Arab marauders, the throne of Judah rightfully belonged to him as the only legitimate heir.Ahaziah is made king; reigneth wickedly, 2 Chronicles 22:1-4. In his confederacy with Joram the son of Ahab he is slain by Jehu, 2 Chronicles 22:5-9. Athaliah destroyeth all the seed royal, save Joash, who was hid, and usurpeth the kingdom, 2 Chronicles 22:10-12.  Men that came with the Arabians; either, 1. A cruel sort of men who came along with the Arabians, and therefore slew those whom the Arabians had spared, and only carried into captivity. Or, 2. The Philistines, who did accompany the Arabians in this expedition, 2 Chronicles 21:16, who lived near the kingdom of Judah, and therefore thought to make as sure work as they could in destroying all the branches of the royal family, who otherwise, they expected, would recover strength, and revenge themselves upon them. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead,.... He being the only surviving one of the sons of Jehoram, the same with Jehoahaz, 2 Chronicles 21:17 who was saved when the rest were taken captive and slain, by his mother Athaliah, and he made his escape, and that she also escaped is clear from 2 Chronicles 22:10. for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp; that is, of the Philistines, 2 Chronicles 21:16, which band seems to be a band or company of thieves and robbers, as the Septuagint, cruel and barbarous, as the action ascribed to them shows: for they had slain all the eldest; sons of Jehoram; the Philistines and Arabians only carried them away captives, but those slew them in cold blood: so Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned; being declared his successor by the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Geneva Study BibleAnd the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the {a} Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.(a) Meaning the Philistines.",
