(Comp. 2Kings 15:32-38.)LENGTH AND CHARACTER OF THE REIGN.PUBLIC WORKS (2Chronicles 27:1-4).(1) Jotham was twenty and five years old.—Word for word as 2Kings 15:33, only adding Jotham.Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.—Perhaps the high priest Zadok of 1Chronicles 6:12. (Comp. 2Chronicles 22:11.)Benson CommentaryA.M. 3246. — B.C. 758.Jotham reigns well and prospers, 2 Chronicles 27:1-6. The conclusion of his reign, 2 Chronicles 27:7-9.2 Chronicles 27:2. He did that which was right, &c. — He did according to all his father Uzziah did, except in his miscarriages. We must not imitate those we have the greatest esteem for, any further than they do well; and their failings must be warnings to us, to walk more circumspectly.2 Chronicles 27:3. He built the high gate, &c. — Otherwise called the new gate. He repaired it, for it was built before, 2 Chronicles 11:5. On the wall of Ophel he built much — Ophel was a tower upon or near the wall of Jerusalem, which probably he fortified, as his father had other towers.2 Chronicles 27:5-6. He fought also with the Ammonites — Who, it seems, endeavoured to shake off the yoke, which from David’s time had been put upon them. So Jotham became mighty — In wealth, and power, and influence upon the neighbouring nations, who courted his friendship, and feared his displeasure; because he prepared his ways, &c. — Or, directed his ways, his counsels, and actions, by the rule of God’s law. The more steadfast we are in religion, the more mighty we are both for the resistance of that which is evil, and for the performance of that which is good.2 Chronicles 27:9. And Jotham slept with his fathers — He died in the midst of his days, being only forty-one years of age, finishing his course too soon, as we may be ready to say, considering his great usefulness, but finishing it with honour, and having the happiness of not outliving his reputation, as his last three mentioned predecessors outlived theirs. And Ahaz his son reigned in his stead — Whose character, in all respects, was the reverse of his. “When that wealth and powers,” says Henry, “which wise men have done good with, devolves upon fools, that will do hurt with it, it is lamentable, and shall be for a lamentation.” Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary27:1-9 Jotham's reign in Judah. - The people did corruptly. Perhaps Jotham was wanting towards the reformation of the land. Men may be very good, and yet not have courage and zeal to do what they might. It certainly casts blame upon the people. Jotham prospered, and became mighty. The more stedfast we are in religion, the more mighty we are, both to resist evil, and to do good. The Lord often removes wise and pious rulers, and sends others, whose follies and vices punish a people that valued not their mercies.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThis short chapter runs parallel with 2 Kings marginal reference), and is taken mainly from the same source or sources which it amplifies.
