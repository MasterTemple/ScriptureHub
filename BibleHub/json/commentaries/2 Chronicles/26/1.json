(Comp. 2Kings 14:21-22; 2Kings 15:2-3.)(1) Then.—And.Uzziah.—So the chronicler always names him, except in one place (1Chronicles 3:12), where the name Azariah appears, as in 2Kings 14:21; 2Kings 15:1; 2Kings 15:6, &c. In 2Kings 15:13; 2Kings 15:30; 2Kings 15:32; 2Kings 15:34, Uzziah occurs (though there also the LXX. reads Azariah, thus making the usage of Kings uniform); as also in the headings of the prophecies of Hosea, Amos, and Isaiah. It is not, therefore, to be regarded either as a popular abbreviation or a transcriber’s blunder, as Schrader and others suggest. In the Assyrian inscriptions of Tiglathpileser II this king is uniformly called Azriyahu, i.e., Azariah. Clearly, therefore, he was known by both names; but to foreigners chiefly by the latter. (Comp. Azareel—Uzziel, 1Chronicles 25:4; 1Chronicles 25:18.)Benson Commentary2 Chronicles 26:1. The people of Judah took Uzziah — Called also Azariah, 2 Kings 14:21; both names signifying the same thing, the strength, or help of God. Of this and 2 Chronicles 26:1; 2 Chronicles 26:3-4, see notes on 2 Kings 14:21-22; and 1 Kings 15:2-3.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary26:1-15 As long as Uzziah sought the Lord, and minded religion, God made him to prosper. Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperity is his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, and kept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God, every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless the indolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will never suffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughout all the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makes truly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself to sports, but delighted in husbandry.Barnes' Notes on the BibleUzziah - This form of the name is found uniformly in Chronicles (except 1 Chronicles 3:12) and in the prophets. The writer of Kings prefers the form Azariah. Uzziah has been regarded as a phonetic corruption of the real name used by the common people. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 262Ch 26:1-8. Uzziah Succeeds Amaziah and Reigns Well in the Days of Zechariah.1. Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah—(See on [453]2Ki 14:21; [454]2Ki 15:1).Uzziah is made king; reigneth well in the days of Zechariah, and prospereth, 2 Chronicles 26:1-15. He invadeth the priest’s office; is smitten with a leprosy, 2 Chronicles 26:16-21. He dieth, and Jotham succeedeth him, 2 Chronicles 26:22,23.  Uzziah;  called also Azariah, 2 Kings 14:21; both names signifying the same thing, God’s strength, or help. See of this, and 2 Chronicles 26:2-4, on 2 Kings 14:21,22 15:2,3. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleThen all the people of Judah took Uzziah,.... Of this and the three following verses, see the notes on 2 Kings 14:21 where Uzziah is called Azariah. See Gill on 2 Kings 14:21, 2 Kings 14:22, 2 Kings 15:2, 2 Kings 15:3 Geneva Study BibleThen all the people of Judah took {a} Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.(a) Called also Azariah.",
