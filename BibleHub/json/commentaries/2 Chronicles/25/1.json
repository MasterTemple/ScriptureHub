EXECUTION OF THE MURDERERS OF JOASH (2Chronicles 25:1-4).(1, 2) Amaziah . . . the Lord.—So 2Kings 14:2.But not with a perfect heart.—This is a brief equivalent of the words of the older text: “only not like David his father: according to all that Joash his father had done, he did.” The reference to Joash is omitted, perhaps because that king appears to less advantage in the Chronicles than ill Kings. In fact, the chronicler’s estimate of both princes is less favourable than that of the older historian. Such differences are perfectly natural, and it is needless to attempt to “reconcile” or eliminate them.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary25:1-13 Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Many do what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work for repentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to his honour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage was sustain in his service, will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we are called to part with any thing for God and our religion, it should satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convinced sinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denying obedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do for the hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy we lose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? What shall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour to quiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices are necessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is given up for his sake.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThis chapter is evidently taken to a large extent from the same document as Kings (see the marginal reference and the notes). At the same time it contains large and important additions; e. g. 2 Chronicles 25:5-10, 2 Chronicles 25:13-16. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 252Ch 25:1-4. Amaziah Begins to Reign Well.1. Amaziah was twenty and five years old, &c.—(See 2Ki 14:1-6).Amaziah beginneth to reign well; slayeth his father’s murderers, 2 Chronicles 25:1-4. Having hired an army of Israelites against the Edomites, at the word of a prophet he dismisseth them, 2 Chronicles 25:5-10; and with his own people overthroweth the Edomites: the Israelites in their return home spoil, 2 Chronicles 25:11-13. Amaziah serveth the gods of Edom, and despiseth the admonition of the prophet, 2 Chronicles 25:14-16. He provoketh Joash to his overthrow, 2 Chronicles 25:17-21. His reign; he is slain by conspiracy, 2 Chronicles 25:25-28.  Of this verse, and ver. 2-4, See Poole \"2 Kings 14:1\", etc. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAmaziah was twenty five years old when he began to reign,....
