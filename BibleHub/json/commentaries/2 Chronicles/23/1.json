        "text": "XXIII.THE FALL OF ATHALIAH, AND SUCCESSION OF JOASH.(Comp. 2Kings 11:4-20.)(1) Jehoiada strengthened himself.—Showed himself strong or courageous, behaved boldly (1Samuel 4:9). The chronicler has substituted a favourite expression (hithchazzaq) for the term used in Kings, “Jehoiada sent.”The captains of hundreds.—Their names, added here, are not given in 2Kings 11:4. On the other hand, Kings reads, “the captains of the hundreds of the Carians (or body-guard) and the Runners (or couriers, i.e., royal messengers) “—terms which were probably obscure to the chronicler.Azariah . . . and Azariah.—Heb.,’Azaryāh . . . and ‘Azaryāhû. (Comp. 2Chronicles 21:2.) These names are introduced in the chronicler s well-known manner (by the prefix le, marking the object of the verb). His style is very visible in the additions to the narrative as compared with Kings.Benson Commentary2 Chronicles 23:1. And took the captains of hundreds — Not all, but those here following, in whom he put most trust. But the contents of this chapter, in general, having occurred 2 Kings 11., where they are explained, little need be said on them here.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary23:12-20 A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy might direct Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram's crimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. But no marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance, by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty of misery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin of their health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoram here stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that the controversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethren to strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David's house must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings, because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may be afflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements, and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease, even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick and solitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under the curse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorable case. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyes of those who have but little religion.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe five names do not occur in Kings; only, and incidentally, the five divisions of the royal guard (2 Kings 11:5 note). Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 232Ch 23:1-11. Jehoiada Makes Joash King.1. in the seventh year Jehoiada … took the captains of hundreds, &c.—(See on [446]2Ki 11:4; [447]2Ki 11:17). The five officers mentioned here had been probably of the royal guard, and were known to be strongly disaffected to the government of Athaliah.Jehoiada maketh Joash king, 2 Chronicles 23:1-11. Athaliah is slain, 2 Chronicles 23:12-15. The pure worship of God is restored, 2 Chronicles 23:16-21.  Took the captains of hundreds;  not all, but those here following, in whom he put most trust. But this chapter is almost all taken out of 2 Kings 11, where it is explained. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleThe contents of this chapter are the same with 2 Kings 11:4 and need no other explanation than what may be found in the notes there, to which the reader is referred.See Gill on 2 Kings 11:4.
