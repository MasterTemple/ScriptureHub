In our verse it is the lower part of the capital, the circumvolution, with the chain net-work and the pomegranates, which is spoken of. From this, Bertheau concludes that דּביר must signify the same as the more usual שׂבכה, viz., \"the lattice-work which was set about the top of the pillars, and served to fasten the pomegranates,\" and that bdbyr has arisen out of בּרביד by a transposition of the letters. בּרביד (chains) should be read here.
