Nor is it known whether he belonged to the royal family, or to the nobles of the land, but as the selection was made from that class it is probable. Those who were at first carried into captivity were selected exclusively from the more elevated classes of society, and there is every reason to believe that Daniel belonged to a family of rank and consequence. The Jews say that he was of the royal family, and was descended from Hezekiah, and cite his history in confirmation of the prophecy addressed by Isaiah to that monarch, \"Of thy sons which shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon,\" ",

The versions present no difficulty here, only the Septuagint adds a clause to bring this verse into harm(my with ver. 3: the Septuagint rendering is, \"And there were of the race of the sons of Israel that came from Judaea, Daniel, Ananias, Mishael, and Azarias.\" That they were of \"the children of Judah\" seems to exclude the possibility of these four belonging to any other tribe, all the more that the whole children of Israel are spoken of in the third verse. The version which we find in the Septuagint leaves the matter tree. At the same time, the addition is one that is so naturally suggested by the third verse, that we cannot claim that the reading of the Septuagint is the more probable. The names of the four companions all occur elsewhere, and, as is usual with Hebrew names, all are significant. Daniel means either \"Judge of God\" or \"God my Judge.\" As Hebrew grammar is now, the latter is the meaning; but there was an older form of the construct state, which appears in proper names like \"Gabriel,\" which makes it probable that \"Judge of God\" or \"Divine Judge\" is the meaning intended to be conveyed.
