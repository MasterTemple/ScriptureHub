All this may well be applied to the doom of every sinner. At death, the sinner's days are numbered and finished; after death is the judgment, when he will be weighed in the balance, and found wanting; and after judgment the sinner will be cut asunder, and given as a prey to the devil and his angels. While these things were passing in the palace, it is considered that the army of Cyrus entered the city; and when Belshazzar was slain, a general submission followed. Soon will every impenitent sinner find the writing of God's word brought to pass upon him, whether he is weighed in the balance of the law as a self-righteous Pharisee, or in that of the gospel as a painted hypocrite.",

Herodotus (vi. 98) says, that it is equivalent to ἑρξίης  herxiēs, \"one who restrains,\" but Hesychius says that it is the same as φρόνιμος  phronimos - \"prudent.\" Grotefend, who has found it in the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis, as Darheush, or Darjeush (\"Heeren's Ideen,\" i. 2, p. 350), makes it to be a compound word, the first part being an abbreviation of Dara, \"Lord,\" and the latter portion coming from kshah, \"king.\" Martin reads the name Dareiousch Vyschtasponea on the Persepolitan inscriptions; that is, Darius, son of Vishtaspo. Lassen, however, gives Darhawus Vistaspaha, the latter word being equivalent to the Gustasp of the modern Persian, and meaning \"one whose employment is about horses.\" See Anthon's \"Class.
