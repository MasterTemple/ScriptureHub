Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta carries the repetition yet further, and inserts, \"And his heart shall be changed from the heart of 't man, and the heart of a beast shall be given him.\" In this the process already begun in the text of the Massoretes is carried a little further.
