This, probably, is the true reading. The Peshitta agrees with the Massoretic pretty closely, \"He shall stretch  his hand over the countries, and the land of Egypt shall escape from his hands.\" The Vulgate has nothing to justify remark. Probably this verse, in the way it is rendered by Theodotion, is a portion of the lost vision of Daniel. The vagueness of \"countries\" stands in contrast to the definiteness of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, and is thus suspicious. Help was always expected from Egypt in the time when Assyria and Babylonia successively claimed the subjection of the Holy Land. Daniel 11:42",
