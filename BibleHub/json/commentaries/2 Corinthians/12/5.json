Then he saw with open vision; now he walks by faith and not by the thing seen.

We are not capable, nor is it fit we should yet know, the particulars of that glorious place and state. He did not attempt to publish to the world what he had heard there, but he set forth the doctrine of Christ. On that foundation the church is built, and on that we must build our faith and hope.

But it seems to me that the connection requires that we should understand it of a person, and that the passage is partly ironical. Paul speaks in the third person.
