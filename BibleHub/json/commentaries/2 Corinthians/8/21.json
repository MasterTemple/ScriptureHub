It is needful, in the first place, to act uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight of men should also be attended to.

The sentiment is, that we are to see to it beforehand that all our conduct shall be comely or honest.

His idea is, that he meant so to conduct in the whole transaction as that his conduct should be approved by God, but that it should also be regarded as beautiful or correct in the sight of people. He knew how much his own usefulness depended on an irreproachable character. He, therefore, procured the appointment of one who had the entire confidence of the churches to travel with him. But there is no reason for confining this to the particular case under consideration. It seems to have been the leading maxim of the life of Paul, and it should be of ours.
