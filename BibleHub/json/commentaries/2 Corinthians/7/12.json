But the words, \"unto you,\" thus, would be rather obscure; still the obscurity of the genuine reading may have been the very reason for the change being made by correctors into the reading of English Version. Alford explains the reading: \"He wrote in order to bring out their zeal on his behalf (that is, to obey his command), and make it manifest to themselves in God's sight, that is, to bring out among them their zeal to regard and obey him.\" But some of the oldest manuscripts and versions (including the Vulgate and old Italian) support English Version. And the words, \"to you,\" suit it better than the other reading. 2Co 2:4, \"I wrote … that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you,\" plainly accords with it, and disproves Alford's assertion that English Version is inconsistent with the fact as to the purpose of his letter. His writing, he says, was not so much for the sake of the individual offender, or the individual offended, but from his \"earnest care\" or concern for the welfare of the Church.",
