If it be supposed that he meant to speak seriously, the sense will be, \"If the false teacher could recommend a better Saviour than I have done, or a Spirit better able to sanctify and save, then there would be a propriety in your receiving him and tolerating his doctrines.\" If the former, then the sense will be, \"You cannot well bear with me; but if a man comes among you preaching a false Saviour, and a false Spirit, and a false doctrine. then you bear with him without any difficulty.\"",

To me it seems probable, however, that Paul spoke seriously, and that our translation has expressed the true sense.
