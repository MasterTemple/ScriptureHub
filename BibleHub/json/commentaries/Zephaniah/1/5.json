The expressions are figurative, speaking every where desolation; the land shall be left without inhabitants. The sinners to be consumed are, the professed idolaters, and those that worship Jehovah and idols, or swear to the Lord, and to Malcham. Those that think to divide their affections and worship between God and idols, will come short of acceptance with God; for what communion can there be between light and darkness? If Satan have half, he will have all; if the Lord have but half, he will have none. Neglect of God shows impiety and contempt. May none of us be among those who draw back unto perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.",

These \"worshiped,\" as they thought, \"the Lord,\" bound themselves solemnly by oath to Him, but with a reserve, joining a hateful idol to Him, in that they, by a religious act, owned it too as god. The act which they did was in direct words, or by implication, forbidden by God. The command to \"swear by the Lord\" implied that they were to swear by none else. It was followed by the prohibition to go after other gods. (Deuteronomy 6:13-14; Deuteronomy 10:30, compare Isaiah 65:16; Jeremiah 4:2). Contrariwise, to swear by other gods was forbidden as a part of their service. \"Be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the Law of Moses, neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, but cleave unto the Lord your God\" (Joshua 23:6-8; compare Amos 8:14). \"How shall I pardon thee for this? Thy children have forsaken Me, and have sworn by those who are no gods\" Jeremiah 5:7. \"They taught My people to swear by Baal\" Jeremiah 12:16. They thought perhaps that in that they professed to serve God, did the greater homage to Him, professed and bound themselves to be His, (such is the meaning of \"swear to the Lord\") they might, without renouncing His service, do certain things, \"swear by their king,\" although in effect they thereby owned hint also as god. To such Elijah said, \"How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow Him; but if Baal, then follow him\" 1 Kings 18:21; and God by Jeremiah rejects with abhorrence such divided service. \"Ye trust in lying words, which will not profit. Will ye steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods, and come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My name, saying, We are delivered to do all these abominations\" Jeremiah 7:8-10. And Hosea, \"Neither go ye to Beth-aven, and swear there, The Lord liveth\" Hosea 4:15.",
