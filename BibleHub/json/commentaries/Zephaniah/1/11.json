The Jewish royal family shall be reckoned with for their pride and vanity; and those that leap on the threshold, invading their neighbours' rights, and seizing their possessions. The trading people and the rich merchants are called to account. Secure and careless people are reckoned with. They are secure and easy; they say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil; that is, they deny his dispensing rewards and punishments. But in the day of the Lord's judgment, it will clearly appear that those who perish, fall a sacrifice to Divine justice for breaking God's law, and because they have no interest by faith in the Redeemer's atoning sacrifice.",

Striking is it, that Scripture saith not, 'who dwell in the valley or in the alley,' but who \"dwell in the mortar,\" because as corn, when the pestle striketh, is bruised, so the army of the enemy shall rush down upon you\" (Jerome). The place intended is probably so much of the valley of the Tyropoeon, which intersected Jerusalem from north to south, as was enclosed by the second wall, on the north, and the first wall on the south. The valley  \"extended as far as the fountain of Siloam,\" and united with the valley of Jehoshaphat a little below Ophel. It was  \"full of houses,\" and, from its name as well as from its situation, it was probably the scene of petty merchandise, where the occasions in which men could and did break the law and offend God, were the more continual, because they entered into their daily life, and were a part of it. The sound of the pestle was continually heard there; another sound should thereafter be heard, when they should not bruise, but be themselves bruised. The name \"Maktesh\" was probably chosen to express how their false hopes, grounded on the presence of God's temple among them while by their sins they profaned it, should be turned into true fears. They had been and thought themselves \"Mikdash,\" \"a holy place,. sanctuary;\" they should be Maktesh , wherein all should be utterly bruised in pieces.",
