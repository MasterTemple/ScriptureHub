Alford thinks the narrative in Ge 6:2 is alluded to, not the fall of the devil and his angels, as he thinks \"giving themselves over to fornication\" (Jude 7) proves; compare Greek, \"in like manner to these,\" namely, to the angels (Jude 6). It seems to me more natural to take \"sons of God\" (Ge 6:2) of the Sethites, than of angels, who, as \"spirits,\" do not seem capable of carnal connection. The parallel, 2Pe 2:4, plainly refers to the fall of the apostate angels. And \"in like manner to these,\" Jude 7, refers to the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, \"the cities about them\" sinning \"in like manner\" as \"they\" did [Estius and Calvin]. Even if Greek \"these,\" Jude 7, refer to the angels, the sense of \"in like manner as these\" will be, not that the angels carnally fornicated with the daughters of men, but that their ambition, whereby their affections went away from God and they fell, is in God's view a sin of like kind spiritually as Sodom's going away from God's order of nature after strange flesh; the sin of the apostate angels after their kind is analogous to that of the human Sodomites after their kind. Compare the somewhat similar spiritual connection of whoremongers and covetousness. The apocryphal book of Enoch interprets Ge 6:2 as Alford. But though Jude accords with it in some particulars, it does not follow that he accords with it in all. The Hebrews name the fallen angels Aza and Azael.",
