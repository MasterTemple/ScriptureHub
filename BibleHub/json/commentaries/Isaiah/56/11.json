Their soul lives and moves in the lowest parts of their nature; it is nothing but selfish avarice, self-indulgent greediness, violent restlessness of passion, that revolves perpetually around itself. With the words \"and these are shepherds,\" the range of the prophet's vision is extended to the leaders of the nation generally; for when the prophet adds as an exclamation, \"And such (hi  equals  tales) are shepherds!\" he applies the glaring contrast between calling and conduct to the holders of both offices, that of teacher and that of ruler alike. For, apart from the accents, it would be quite at variance with the general use of the personal pronoun המה, to apply it to any other persons than those just described (viz., in any such sense as this: \"And those, who ought to be shepherds, do not know\"). Nor is it admissible to commence an adversative minor clause with והמה, as Knobel does, \"whereas they are shepherds;\" for, since the principal clause has  הכלבים (dogs) as the subject, this would introduce a heterogeneous mixture of the two figures, shepherds' dogs and shepherds. We therefore take רעים והמה as an independent clause: \"And it is upon men of such a kind, that the duty of watching and tending the nation devolves!\" These רעים (for which the Targum reads רעים) are then still further described: they know not to understand, i.e., they are without spiritual capacity to pass an intelligible judgment (compare the opposite combination of the two verbs in ",
