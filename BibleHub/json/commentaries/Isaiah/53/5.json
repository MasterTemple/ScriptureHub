We are saved from the ruin, to which by sin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement was to be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Our sins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet, the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. By his sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, to mortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We may well endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem all things but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.",

'And he shall build the house of the sanctuary which was defiled on account of our sins, and which was delivered on account of our iniquities. And in his doctrine, peace shall be multiplied to us. And when we obey his words, our sins shall be remitted to us.' The Syriac renders it in a remarkable manner, 'He is slain on account of our sins,' thus showing that it was a common belief that the Messiah would be violently put to death.

The obvious idea would be that there would be some act of piercing, some penetrating wound that would endanger or take life. Applied to the actual sufferings of the Messiah, it refers undoubtedly to the piercing of his hands, his feet, and his side. The word 'tormented,' in the margin, was added by our translators because the Hebrew word might be regarded as derived from חול  chûl, to writhe, to be tormented, to be pained - a word not unfrequently applied to the pains of parturition. But it is probable that it is rather to be regarded as derived from חלל  châlal, \"to pierce, or to wound.\"",

The word itself, which follows the form of mūsâd (Isaiah 28:16), signifies primarily being chastised (from yâsar  equals  vâsar, constringere, coercere), and included from the very outset the idea of practical chastisement, which then passed over into that of admonition in words, of warning by example, and of chastity as a moral quality. In the case before us, in which the reference is to a sufferer, and to a mūsâr resting upon him, this can only mean actual chastisement.

The connection of the words is the same as that of חיּים תּוכחת in Proverbs 15:31. As the latter signifies \"reproof leading to life,\" so the former signifies \"the chastisement which leads to our peace.\" It is true that the suffix belongs to the one idea, that that has grown up through this combination of the words, like berı̄th shelōmı̄, \"my peace-covenant\" (Isaiah 54:10); but what else could our \"peace-chastisement\" be, than the chastisement that brings us peace, or puts us into a state of salvation? This is the idea involved in Stier's rendering, \"restoring chastisement,\" and Hofmann's, \"the chastisement wholesome for us.\" The difference in the exposition simply lies in the view entertained of the mūsâr, in which neither of these commentators will allow that there is any idea of a visitation of justice here. But according to our interpretation, the genitive שׁלומנו, which defines the mūsâr so far as its object and results are concerned, clearly shows that this manifestation of the justice of God, this satisfaction procured by His holiness, had His love for its foundation and end. It was our peace, or, what is more in accordance with the full idea of the word, our general well-being, our blessedness, which these sufferings arrived at and secured (the synonyms of shâlōm are tōbh and yeshū‛âh, Isaiah 52:7). In what follows, \"and by His stripes (chăbhūrâh  equals  chabbūrâh, Isaiah 1:6) we have been healed,\" shâlōm is defined as a condition of salvation brought about by healing. \"Venustissimum ὀξύμωρον,\" exclaims Vitringa here.
