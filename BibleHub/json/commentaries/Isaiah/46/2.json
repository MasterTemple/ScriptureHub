But their worshippers cannot help them; both the idols and the idolaters are gone into captivity. Let not God's people be afraid of either. Those things from which ungodly men expect safety and happiness, will be found unable to save them from death and hell. The true God will never fail his worshippers. The history of the life of every believer is a kind of abstract of the history of Israel. Our spiritual life is upheld by his grace, as constantly as our natural life by his providence. And God will never leave them. The Author will be the Finisher of their well-being, when, by decays, they need help as much as in infancy. This promise to Israel, enfeebled and grown old as a nation, is applicable to every aged follower of Christ. When compassed about with infirmities, and perhaps those around begin to grow weary of you, yet I am He that I have promised to be, He that you would have me to be. I will bear you up; carry you on in your way, and carry you home at last. If we learn to trust in and love him, we need not be anxious about our remaining days or years; he will still provide for us and watch over us, both as the creatures of his power, and as new-created by his Spirit.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThey stoop - Bel, and Nebo, and all the Babylonian gods (see Isaiah 46:1).They could not deliver the burden - The word 'burden' here, probably means the load of metal, wood, and stone, of which the idols were composed. The gods whom the Babylonians worshipped had not even power to protect the images which were made to represent them, and which had now become a heavy burden to the animals and wains which were carrying them away. They could not rescue them from the hands of the conqueror; and how unable were they, therefore, to defend those who put their trust in them. The Vulgate renders this, 'They could not deliver him that bare them.' The Septuagint, 'You are carrying them like a burden bound on the weary, faint, and hungry; who are all without strength, and unable to escape from battle; and as for them, they are carried away captives!'But themselves - Margin, as Hebrew, 'Their soul.' The sense is, that the gods thus worshipped, so far from being able to defend those who worshipped them, had themselves become captive, and were borne to a distant land. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary2. deliver—from the enemies' hands.burden—their images laid on the beasts (Isa 46:1).themselves—the gods, here also distinguished from their images.Matthew Poole's Commentary They;  either, 1. The idols, of whom these words are used, Isaiah 46:1. Or, 2. The Babylonians, who are sufficiently implied in that expression, their idols, Isaiah 46:1. They bow down together;  either, 1. One as well as another; or, 2. The Babylonians and their idols together, neither could help the other. They could not deliver the burden;  either, 1. The idols could not deliver themselves, who were now a burden to the beasts, and carried away by them; or, 2. The Babylonians could not deliver their idols, which he now had called burdens. And this sense seems most probable from the following clause, which clearly speaks of the same persons or things; but themselves, &c., Heb. their souls; for although the soul is here put for the person, as it commonly is, yet that title is never given to any idol or lifeless thing, but only to such creatures as have or had souls within their bodies. So the meaning of this and the foregoing verse is this, that neither the Babylonians nor their idols could either save themselves or one another, but both are bowed down and gone into captivity together. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleThey stoop, they bow together,.... Either the beasts under their burdens, or other idols besides those mentioned; or rather the Babylonians themselves, who were obliged to submit to the conquerors: they could not deliver the burdens; the idols could not save themselves from being laid as burdens upon the beasts, any more than they could save their worshippers: so the Targum understands this and the preceding clause of them; \"they are cut off, and cut to pieces together, they could not deliver those that carried them;'' or else the Babylonians are designed, who could not save their gods from being used in this shameful manner: but themselves are gone into captivity, or \"their souls\" (m); what were as dear to them as their own souls, their idols; to whom also souls may be ascribed by way of derision, being inanimate as well as irrational; and it is not unusual for idols to be said to be carried captive; hence those words of Tertullian, \"manent et simulachra caplira\": or rather the Babylonians, who went into captivity themselves, and so could not save their idols: thus they who had led captive the Jews are led captive themselves; and thus it will be with mystical Babylon, Revelation 13:10. (m) \"et animae eorum\", V. L. Munster, Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius. Geneva Study Bible{c} They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but {d} themselves have gone into captivity.(c) The beasts that carried the idols fell down under their burden.(d) He derides the idols, who had neither soul nor sense.",
