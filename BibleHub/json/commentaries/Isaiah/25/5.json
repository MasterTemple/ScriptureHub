        "text": "The branch of the terrible ones . . .—Better, the song. The Hebrew noun is a rare one, but is found in this sense in Song Song of Solomon 2:12. The triumph song of the dread oppressors is thought of as blighting the world like a spell of evil; but this also is to be brought low, and hushed in silence.Benson CommentaryIsaiah 25:5. Thou shall bring down the wise of strangers — The tumultuous noise, as the word properly signifies; the rage and furious attempts of those heathen nations that fought against God’s people. As the heat in a dry place — With as much ease as thou dost allay the heat of a dry place, by the shadow of thy clouds, or by the rain which falls from black and shadowy clouds. Here again, as in Isaiah 25:2, instead of strangers, Bishop Lowth reads, the proud. The branch of the terrible ones — Their arm or power, as a branch is the arm of a tree; shall be brought low — Shall be humbled and broken.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary25:1-5 However this might show the deliverance of the Jews out of captivity, it looked further, to the praises that should be offered up to God for Christ's victories over our spiritual enemies, and the comforts he has provided for all believers. True faith simply credits the Lord's testimony, and relies on his truth to perform his promises. As God weakens the strong who are proud and secure, so he strengthens the weak that are humble, and stay themselves upon him. God protects his people in all weathers. The Lord shelters those who trust in him from the insolence of oppressors. Their insolence is but the noise of strangers; it is like the heat of the sun scorching in the middle of the day; but where is it when the sun is set? The Lord ever was, and ever will be, the Refuge of distressed believers. Having provided them a shelter, he teaches them to flee unto it.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThou shalt bring down the noise - The tumult; the sound which they make in entering into battle; or the note of triumph, and the sound of revelry. The phrase may refer either to their shout of exultation over their vanquished foes; or to the usual sound of revelry; or to the hum of business in a vast city.Of strangers - Of foreigners (see the note at Isaiah 25:2).As the heat in a dry place - The parallelism here requires that we should suppose the phrase 'with the shadow of a cloud' to be supplied in this hemistich, as it is obscurely expressed in our translation by the word 'even,' and it would then read thus:As the beat in a dry place (by the shadow of a cloud),The noise of the strangers shalt thou humble;As the heat by the shadow of a cloud,The exultation of the formidable ones shalt thou bring low.The idea thus is plain. Heat pours down intensely on the earth, and if unabated would wither up every green thing, and dry up every stream and fountain. But a cloud intervenes, and checks the burning rays of the sun. So the wrath of the 'terrible ones,' the anger of the Babylonians, raged against the Jews. But the mercy of God interposed. It was like the intervening of a cloud to shut out the burning rays of the sun. It stayed the fury of their wrath, \"and rendered them impotent to do injury, just as the intense burning rays of the sun are completely checked by an interposing cloud.The branch of the terrible ones - This is a very unhappy translation. The word זמיר  zâmiyr is indeed used to denote a branch, or bough, as derived from זמר  zâmar, \"to prune a vine;\" but it also has the I sense of \"a song;\" a song of praise, or a song of exultation, from a second signification of זמר  zâmar, \"to sing; perhaps\" from the song with which the work of the vineyard was usually accompanied. See the verb used in this sense in Judges 5:3; Psalm 9:12; Psalm 30:5; Psalm 47:7; and the word which occurs here (zamir) used in the sense of a song in Psalm 119:54; 2 Samuel 23:1; Job 35:10. Here it is undoubtedly used in the sense of a song, meaning either a shout of victory or of revelry; and the idea of the prophet is, that this would be brought low by the destruction of Babylon, and by the return of the captive Jews to their own land. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary5. Translate, \"As the heat in a dry land (is brought down by the shadow of a cloud, so) thou shalt bring down the tumult (the shout of triumph over their enemies) of strangers (foreigners); and as the heat by the shadow of the cloud (is brought low), so the branch (the offspring) of the terrible ones shall be brought low.\" Parkhurst translates the Hebrew for \"branch,\" the exulting song. Jerome translates the last clause, \"And as when the heat burns under a cloud, thou shalt make the branch of the terrible ones to wither\"; the branch withering even under the friendly shade of a cloud typifies the wicked brought to ruin, not for want of natural means of prosperity, but by the immediate act of God.Matthew Poole's Commentary The noise;  the tumultuous noise, as the word properly signifies, which he called their blast in the foregoing verse; by which he means their rage and furious attempts, which are commonly managed with much noise and clamour. Of strangers;  of those strange and heathen nations that fought against God’s people. Even the heat with the shadow of a cloud;  with as much ease as thou dost in the course of thy common providence allay the heat of a dry season and place, either by the shadow of thy clouds, or by the rain which falleth from black and shadowy clouds. The branch;  the arm or power, as a branch is the arm of a tree. Or, the prince or commanders; for the word branch is sometimes put for a person of eminent place and power, as Psalm 80:15 Isaiah 4:2 Zechariah 3:8 6:12. But others render the word, the song, as it is used, Song of Solomon 2:12, their jovial and triumphant song. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleThou shalt bring down the noise of strangers,.... Such as are strangers to God and godliness, to Christ, his Gospel, and truths, to the Spirit and his operations of grace; the clamour and noise of such against true religion, and the professors of it, their persecuting rage and fury, this the Lord in his own time will bring down, and cause to cease, and it shall be heard no more: as the heat in a dry place: which parches the earth, and burns and dries up the grass and fruits of it; to which persecution is compared: even the heat with the shadow of a cloud; as that is brought down, and caused to cease by the shadow of a cloud, sheltering from the scorching beams of the sun, and by letting down rain, which moistens the earth; so the Lord protects his people from the fury of persecution, and abates it by the interposition of his power and providence; and at last puts an end to it: the branch of the terrible ones shall be made low; meaning the most eminent of them; a branch being put for a most eminent person, Isaiah 4:2 perhaps the pope of Rome is meant, the head of the antichristian party, the principal of the terrible persecutors, who shall be brought low and destroyed by Christ, at his coming. Some render it, \"the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low\" (d); it will be brought a note lower; their triumphing will be at an end; the voice of harpers and musicians, of pipers and trumpeters, will be heard no more among them; but instead thereof weeping and howling, Revelation 18:9. (d)   \"cantus fortium humiliabitur, vel humiliabit se\", Vatablus; see Cant. ii. 12. Geneva Study BibleThou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the {f} heat in a dry place; {g} even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.(f) Meaning, that as the heat is abated by the rain, so shall God bring down the rage of the wicked.(g) As a cloud shades from the heat of the sun, so God will assuage the rejoicing of the wicked against the godly.",
