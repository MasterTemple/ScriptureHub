The \"point\" of this comparison is, that as the lion that \"was intent on his purpose\" could not be frightened from it by numbers, so it would be with Yahweh, who \"was equally intent on his purpose\" - the defense of the city of Jerusalem. It does not mean, of course, that the purpose of God and of the lion resembled each other, but merely that there was similar \"intensity of purpose,\" and similar adherence to it notwithstanding all opposition.
