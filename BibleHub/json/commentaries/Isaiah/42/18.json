For their sins they were spoiled of all their possessions. This fully came to pass in the destruction of the Jewish nation. There is no resisting, nor escaping God's anger. See the mischief sin makes; it provokes God to anger. And those not humbled by lesser judgments, must expect greater. Alas! how many professed Christians are blind as the benighted heathen! While the Lord is well-pleased in saving sinners through the righteousness of Christ he will also glorify his justice, by punishing all proud despisers.

In view of this, and of the great truths which he had uttered, he calls on them to hear, to be alarmed, to return to God, and assures them that for these sins they exposed themselves to, and must experience, his sore displeasure.

But this view seems to be strained. It requires \"deaf\" and \"blind' to be taken in completely different senses in the two consecutive verses, 18 and 19. Probably Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne are right in taking the whole passage of captive Israel, and especially of that \"outer circle\" which was least deserving of God's favour and most open to rebuke and reproach. These \"blind\" and \"deaf\" ones are warned that it is high time for them to unclose their eyes  and open their ears, and are reminded that all their recent and present sufferings arise from their former \"blindness\" and disobedience.
