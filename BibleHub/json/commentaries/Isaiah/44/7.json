Those that serve God he will own. He will help them over difficulties, and in their services. Water is the emblem of the Holy Spirit; as water refreshes, cleanses, and makes the earth fruitful, so do his influences the soul. This gift of the Holy Ghost is the great blessing, the plentiful pouring out of which God kept for the latter days. Where God gives his Spirit, he will give all other blessings. Hereby shall be a great increase of the church; thus it shall be spread to distant places. Was there any other Rock, or Protector, that could defend them? None besides could foretell these things to come, of which God by his prophets gave notice. All was set in order in the Divine predictions, as well as in the Divine purposes. Could any other have done so? Who can compare with Israel's Redeemer and King?Barnes' Notes on the BibleAnd who, as I-- This verse contains an argument to prove that he is God. In proof of this, he appeals to the fact that he alone can predict future events, and certainly declare the order, and the time in which they will come to pass (see the notes at Isaiah 41:21-23; Isaiah 44:9-10).Shall call - That is, call forth the event, or command that to happen which he wills - one of the highest possible exhibitions of power. See a similar use of the word call in Isaiah 46:2; Isaiah 48:15.And shall declare it - Declare, or announce with certainty the future event.And set it in order - Arrange it; secure the proper succession and place (see the notes at Isaiah 41:22). The word used here (ערך  ‛ârak) denotes properly \"to place in a row; set in order; arrange.\" It is of the same signification as the Greek τάσσω  tassō or τάττω  tattō, and is applied to placing the wood upon the altar in a proper manner (Genesis 22:9); or to placing the showbread in proper order on the table Leviticus 24:8; and especially to setting an army in order, or putting it in battle array Genesis 14:8; Judges 20:20, Judges 20:22; 1 Samuel 17:2. Here it means, that God would arrange the events in a proper order - as an army is marshalled and arrayed for battle. There should be no improper sequences of events; no chance; no hap-hazard; no confusion. The events which take place under his government, occur in proper order and time, and so as best to subserve his plans.For me - In order to execute my plans, and to promote my glory. The events on earth are for God. They are such as he chooses to ordain, and are arranged in the manner which he chooses.Since I appointed the ancient people - 'From my constituting the people of old;' that is, God had given them intimations of future events from the very period when he in times long past, had selected and appointed them as his people. They were, therefore, qualified to be his witnesses Isaiah 44:8.And the things that are coming, let them show - (See the notes at Isaiah 41:22-23). Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary7. Who but God can predict future events and declare also the order and time of each (see on [795]Isa 41:22, 23; [796]Isa 45:21)?call—\"openly proclaim\" (Isa 40:6) things to come [Maurer]. Or, \"call forth\" the event; command that it happen (Isa 46:11; 48:15), [Barnes].set … in order—There is no chance or confusion; all events occur in the order best fitted to subserve God's plans.for me—It is FOR God that all things exist and take place (Re 4:11). But Maurer translates, \"Let him set it forth (Job 37:19) to me.\"since … ancient people—I have given the Jews predictions of the future ever since I appointed them as My people in ancient times; therefore they were qualified to be His witnesses (Isa 44:8). As to their being God's \"ancient (everlasting) people,\" see De 32:7-9; Jer 31:3; the type of the redeemed Church (Eph 1:4).Matthew Poole's Commentary Who,  which of all the heathen gods, as I, shall call, and shall declare? shall by his powerful call or word cause it to be, and by his infinite foreknowledge declare that it shall be. Or, shall publish and declare; two words expressing the same thing, as is usual. It;  that which shall come to pass, whatsoever it be; which is easily understood out of the following clause. Set it in order;  orderly relate all future events in the same manner as they shall happen. For me,  Heb. to me, so as I may hear it, and thereby be convinced of their Divinity. Since I appointed the ancient people;  since the time that I appointed or called the Israelites to be my people, whom he calleth the ancient people, because they were his people long before this time; or, as the words may be rendered, the everlasting people, because he determined that he would never totally and finally cast them off and destroy them, as he would do other nations. But the words are and may well be otherwise rendered, since I constituted or made (as this word is elsewhere rendered) the people of the world since I first made man upon earth, as the LXX. and others understand it. Let them give me an account of any of their predictions of future events from the beginning of the world to this day. The things that are coming, and shall come;  such things as are near at hand, and such as are to come hereafter. Unto them;  unto their worshippers; who consult their oracles about future events, as I have told them unto thee, O Jacob, as it follows in the next verse. So the pronoun relative is put for the antecedent, which is left to be understood out of the following clause. Or, to or for themselves, in their own defence. Although these words might have been omitted in the translation, as being insignificant; such pronouns being oft redundant in the Hebrew language, as Genesis 12:1, and oft elsewhere, as also in the Greek and Latin. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd who as I shall call,.... Which of the idols of the Gentiles can do as the king of Israel, the Lord of hosts has done? call things that are not, as though they were? call all creatures into being? call men by their names before they were born, as Isaac; Josiah, and Cyrus, of whom mention is made in the latter end of this chapter, and call them to service and usefulness in their day and generation? and call whom he pleases by his grace to eternal glory? and shall declare it; the end from the beginning, things future that are yet to come to pass; or the purposes and decrees of God, his counsel and covenant, his mind and will? and set it in order for me; give an exact and orderly account of things that shall be throughout the successive ages of time; as Jehovah did with respect to the people of Israel, whose God and king he was; he foretold to Abraham their going into Egypt, and bondage there, their deliverance from thence, and settlement in the land of Canaan, and now their deliverance from Babylon, and by name who should be the instrument of it; none of the gods of the Gentiles could do this, or anything like it, or order and dispose all occurrences in providence for his own glory, and the good of men: since I appointed the ancient people? meaning either the ancient patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their posterity, the children of Israel, who were early formed into a body politic, and into a church state; see Deuteronomy 32:6, or rather the first man, and the first race of men that inhabited the world before the flood, called the old world; and so the sense is, who ever did the things I have done, from the time I made man, and other creatures, and placed them on the earth, or from the creation of the world? so Aben Ezra, Jarchi, and Kimchi interpret it; though it is best of all to understand this of the people of God, the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven, in the Lamb's book of life, from the foundation of the world; who are, as the words may be rendered, \"the people of eternity\" (y); and may be so called, because they were in some sense a people that were \"from eternity\", as the Targum paraphrases it; not that they had an actual personal being so early, for they are but creatures of time, raised up in successive generations, and but of yesterday, and of a short continuance; yet they had from all eternity a representative being in Christ, as their federal head; they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world, and had grace given them in him before the world began, Ephesians 1:3 they were the people of God taken into covenant by him from everlasting, for so early was the covenant of grace made with Christ, and them in him; they stood so early related to God as his children, and to Christ as his spouse and bride; so early were they on the thoughts of God, and on his heart, and in his affections, as they were also upon Christ's, and in his hands, and their names so early registered in his book of life; so that they may be said to be indeed an \"ancient people\", or \"a people of eternity\"; and they may be called so, because they will continue for ever, as the days of heaven, and as the sun and moon, before the Lord, Psalm 89:29, everlasting habitations are provided for them, and they shall be for ever with the Lord; so the Syriac version renders it, \"a people for eternity\": now these are appointed by the Lord to come into actual being at the time, and in the place he has fixed; they are appointed to many things in life; not unto wrath, either here or hereafter, but to afflictions, and to death itself: and they are appointed to many good things, to be called by grace, to be saved with an everlasting salvation, and to reign with Christ in the New Jerusalem state; see Isaiah 24:23 where they are called \"ancients\", as here; and to be glorified with Christ for ever; it follows: and the things that are coming, and shall come? let them show unto them: let the idols show to their worshippers if they can, \"the things that are coming\"; just coming, that are near at hand, that will be tomorrow; and that \"shall come\", are at a greater distance, which will be in ages to come; or wonderful things, and things future, so Jarchi interprets it; a word (z) like the first being used for signs and wonders. God foretells wonderful things that shall come to pass, and which accordingly do; but the idols of the Gentiles can do nothing of this kind. (y)  \"populum seculi\", Munster, Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus, Tigurine version, i.e. \"qui a seculo est\", Targ. \"populum aeternitatis\", Gataker. (z) \"sigma\", with the Rabbins as here. Geneva Study BibleAnd who, as I, shall {g} call, and shall declare it, and set {h} it in order for me, since I appointed the {i} ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let {k} them show to them.(g) And appoint them that will deliver the Church.(h) That is, tell me how I should proceed in this.(i) God calls the Israelites ancient, because he preferred them to all others in his eternal election.(k) Meaning, their idols.",
