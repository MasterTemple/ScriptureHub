In the former part, believers stir up themselves to praise God; here they invite and encourage one another to do it, and are represented as contriving to spread his praise, and to draw in others to join with them in it. Praise the Lord, call upon his name — As giving thanks for former mercies is a modest way of begging for further mercies, so requesting further and fresh mercies is graciously accepted as a thankful acknowledgment of the mercies we have received. Declare, &c. — By speaking and writing. We must not only speak to God, but speak to others concerning him; not only call upon his name, but (as the margin reads it) proclaim his name. Let others know something more from us than they did before concerning God, and those things whereby he hath made himself known. His doings — Or, mighty deeds; as Bishop Lowth renders עלילתיו. The works of redemption and salvation are especially intended; these and his other wonderful works we should declare; among the people — Among the heathen, that they may be brought into communion with Israel, and the God of Israel. When the apostles preached the gospel to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem, then this scripture was fulfilled. Make mention — Hebrew, הזכירו, Record, or cause it to be remembered, that his name is exalted — Is become more illustrious and conspicuous than ever, in and by the incarnation and life, doctrine and miracles, death, and resurrection, and ascension of his Son, and the effusion of his Spirit, in gifts and graces, on the Messiah’s disciples and servants. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things — For his people, to whom he hath given a wonderful proof of his love, and whom he hath magnified and made honourable. Bishop Lowth renders the original expression, שׁאית עשׁה, he hath wrought a stupendous work. In making his Son a sacrifice for our sins. This is known — Or, shall be made known; in all the earth — The knowledge of this glorious work shall no longer be confined to the land of Israel and Judah, as hitherto it hath been, but shall be published to all nations. Cry out and shout — In a holy exultation and transport of joy; thou inhabitant of Zion — Hebrew, שׁבת, inhabitress, thou daughter of Jerusalem, thou church of the living God, represented under the emblem of a woman. Welcome the gospel to thyself, and publish it to others with loud acclamations; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee — Manifesting himself to thee, appearing and doing wonders for thee, and enriching thee with his gifts and graces in great abundance. Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary12:10-16 When the gospel should be publicly preached, the Gentiles would seek Christ Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, and find rest of soul. When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people, mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, that river which separates this world from the eternal world.Barnes' Notes on the BibleAnd in that day - (see Isaiah 12:1).Call upon his name - Margin, 'Proclaim.' It denotes to call upon him in the way of celebrating his praise. The whole hymn is one of praise, and not of prayer.Declare among the people - Among all people, that they may be brought to see his glory, and join in the celebration of his praise.His doings - Particularly in regard to the great events which are the subject of the previous predictions - his interposition in saving people by the Messiah from eternal death.Make mention - Hebrew, 'Cause it to be remembered' (see the note at Isaiah 62:6).That his name is exalted - That it is worthy of adoration and praise. It is worthy to be exalted, or lifted up in view of the nations of the earth 2 Samuel 22:47; Psalm 21:13; Psalm 46:10. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary4. make mention—Hebrew, \"cause it to be remembered.\"Matthew Poole's Commentary Among the people; in all the earth, as it follows, Isaiah 12:5; unto the Gentile world, who shall partake in the blessing, and will join with you in the praising of God for it. The knowledge of this glorious work of our redemption Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleIn that day shall ye say, praise the Lord,.... On account of his being and perfections, for blessings received from him, especially spiritual ones; and particularly such as are before mentioned, fulness of grace in him, strength and salvation by him, a view of interest in him as a Saviour, and divine comforts communicated from him; which is done by giving him the glory of them, and thanks for them. This is a work very proper for Gospel times; it always was a duty, and there was ever reason for it under the former dispensation, and much more under the present one; and there will be still more reason for it in the latter day here referred to, when antichrist will be destroyed, the kingdom of Christ will be enlarged, and his church will be in a very glorious state and condition, her walls will be salvation, and her gates praise; when the saints will be stirring up one another to this service, and engaging in it with all readiness and cheerfulness; see Revelation 11:15, call upon his name: which takes in the whole of religions worship, of which Christ is the object, being the true Jehovah; and particularly prayer, in which his name is invoked together with faith in him, and expressions of affection to his name; which is precious to believers, and is as ointment poured out: declare his doings among the people; not merely his works of creation, in which he was equally concerned with his divine Father; nor so much his miracles which he wrought when on earth, in proof of his deity and Messiahship, and in confirmation of his doctrine; but his acts of obedience and righteousness, which were perfect; and his bearing the sins of his people, and the punishment due to them; and so fulfilled the whole law, and hereby accomplished the great work of redemption and salvation; which, according to his orders, have been published among the Gentiles, for their good, and his glory: make mention that his name is exalted; that is, he himself, who has a name given him above every name; for having obeyed, suffered, and died in the room of his people, he is by his Father, according to promise, exalted, by raising him from the dead, receiving him into heaven, placing him at his right hand, giving him all power in heaven and in earth, and causing angels, authorities, principalities, and powers, to be subject to him; all which is to be made mention of, to the honour of his name: or else the sense is, to speak of him, to make mention of his name, of his person, of his offices, of his grace and salvation, that he may be exalted in each of them by his people; for he is, and ought to be, exalted in their hearts, and with their lips, since he is above all in the excellency of his person, and is their only Saviour and Redeemer, Head and Husband; and so he will be exalted more abundantly in the latter day. See Gill on Isaiah 2:11. Geneva Study BibleAnd in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.",

When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people, mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soon turn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord to gather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holy love, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for his redeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, that river which separates this world from the eternal world.",

Harp to Jehovah; for He has displayed majesty: let this be known in all lands. Shout and be jubilant, O inhabitants of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.\" The first song of six lines is here followed by a second of seven lines: a prophetic word of promise, inserted between them, separates the one from the other. This second also commences with the well-known tones of a psalm (compare especially Psalm 105:1; 1 Chronicles 16:8). The phrase, \"Call upon the name of Jehovah,\" signifies, Make the name of Jehovah the medium of invocation (Ges. 138, Anm. 3*), i.e., invoke it, or, as here, call it out. Gē'ūth is high, towering dignity; here it is used of God, as in Isaiah 26:10, with ‛âsâh: to prove it practically, just as with lābēsh in Psalm 93:1, to show one's self openly therein. Instead of the Chethib meyudda‛ath in Isaiah 12:5, the keri substitutes the hophal form mūda‛ath, probably because meyuddâ‛, according to the standing usage of speech, denotes one well known, or intimate; the passive of the hophal is certainly the more suitable. According to the preceding appeals, the words are to be understood as expressing a desire, that the glorious self-attestation of the God of salvation might be brought to the consciousness of the whole of the inhabitants of the earth, i.e., of all mankind. When God redeems His people, He has the salvation of all the nations in view. It is the knowledge of the Holy One of Israel, made known through the word of proclamation, that brings salvation to them all. How well may the church on Zion rejoice, to have such a God dwelling in the midst of it! He is great as the giver or promises, and great in fulfilling them; great in grace, and great in judgment; great in all His saving acts which spread from Israel to all mankind. Thus does this second psalm of the redeemed nation close, and with it the book of Immanuel. ",
