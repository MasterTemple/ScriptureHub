        "text": "strength … song … salvation—derived from Ex 15:2; Ps 118:14. The idea of salvation was peculiarly associated with the feast of tabernacles (see Isa 12:3). Hence the cry \"Hosanna,\" \"Save, we beseech thee,\" that accompanied Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem on that day (the fifteenth of the seventh month) (Mt 21:9; compare with Ps 118:25, 26); the earnest of the perfected \"salvation\" which He shall bring to His people at His glorious second appearance at Jerusalem (Heb 9:28). \"He shall appear the second time without sin unto salvation.\" Compare Re 21:3, \"The tabernacle of God is with men.\" Compare Lu 9:33, \"three tabernacles: one for thee,\" &c. (the transfiguration being a pledge of the future kingdom), (Ps 118:15; Zec 14:16). As the Jew was reminded by the feast of tabernacles of his wanderings in tents in the wilderness, so the Jew-Gentile Church to come shall call to mind, with thanksgiving, the various past ways whereby God has at last brought them to the heavenly \"city of habitation\" (Ps 107:7).",
