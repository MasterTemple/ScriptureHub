It is therefore the turn of the idol deities now: \"Let them bring forward and announce to us the things that will come to pass.\" the general idea of what is in the future stands at the head. Then within this the choice is given them of proving their foreknowledge of what is afterwards to happen, by announcing either ראשׁנות, or even בּאות. These two ideas, therefore, are generic terms within the range of the things that are to happen. Consequently הרשׁנות cannot mean \"earlier predictions,\" prius praedicta, as Hitzig, Knobel, and others suppose. This explanation is precluded in the present instance by the logic of the context. Both ideas lie upon the one line of the future; the one being more immediate, the other more remote, or as the expression alternating with הבאות implies לאחור האתיּות, ventura in posterum (\"in later times,\" compare ",

This is the explanation adopted by Stier and Hahn, the latter of whom has correctly expounded the word, as denoting \"the events about to happen first in the immediate future, which it is not so difficult to prognosticate from signs that are discernible in the present.\" The choice is given them, either to foretell \"things at the beginning\" (haggı̄dū in our editions is erroneously pointed with kadma instead of geresh), i.e., that which will take place first or next, \"what they be\" (quae et qualia sint), so that now, when the achărı̄th, \"the latter end\" (i.e., the issue of that which is held out to view), as prognosticated from the standpoint of the present, really occurs, the prophetic utterance concerning it may be verified; or \"things to come,\" i.e., things further off, in later times (in the remote future), the prediction of which is incomparably more difficult, because without any point of contact in the present.
