The gnat (viz., a species of stinging gnat, probably the diminutive but yet very troublesome species which is called akol uskut, \"eat and be silent,\" in Egyptian) is called kinnâh, as the talmudic usage shows, where the singular, which does not happen to be met with in the Old Testament, is found in the case of kinnı̄m as well as in that of bētsı̄m.",

This is probably Rckert's opinion, when he adopts the rendering: and its inhabitants \"like so\" (so wie so) do they die. But \"like so\" is here equivalent to \"like nothing.\" That the heavens and the earth do not perish without rising again in a renewed form, is a thought which may naturally be supplied, and which is distinctly expressed in Isaiah 51:16; Isaiah 65:17; Isaiah 66:22. Righteousness (tsedâqâh) and salvation (yeshū‛âh) are the heavenly powers, which acquire dominion through the overthrow of the ancient world, and become the foundations of the new (2 Peter 3:13). That the tsedâqâh will endure for ever, and the yeshū‛âh will not be broken (yēchath, as in Isaiah 7:8, confringetur, whereas in Isaiah 51:7 the meaning is consternemini), is a prospect that opens after the restoration of the new world, and which indirectly applies to men who survive the catastrophe, having become partakers of righteousness and salvation.
