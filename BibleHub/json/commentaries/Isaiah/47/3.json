Grotius, 'I will not suffer any man to be an intercessor.' So Lowth, 'Neither will I suffer man to intercede with me.' Noyes, 'I will make peace with none.' So Gesenius (Lex. by Robinson) renders it, 'I will take vengeance, and will not make peace with man; that is, will make peace with none before all are destroyed.' The word used here (אפגע  'epega‛) is derived from פגע  pâga‛, which means, \"to strike upon\" or \"to strike against\"; \"to impinge upon anyone, or anything; to fall upon in a hostile manner\" 1 Samuel 22:17; \"to kill, to slay\" Judges 8:21; Judges 15:12; \"to assail with petitions, to urge, entreat anyone\" Ruth 1:16; Jeremiah 7:16; \"to light upon, or meet with anyone\" Genesis 28:11, and then, according to Gesenius, \"to strike a league with anyone, to make peace with him.\" Jarchi renders it, 'I will not solicit any man that he should take vengeance;' that is, I will do it myself. Aben Ezra, 'I will not admit the intercession of any man.' Vitringa renders it. 'I will take vengeance, and will not have a man to concur with me; that is, although I should not have a man to concur with me who should execute the vengeance which I meditate; on which account I have raised up Cyrus from Persia, of whom no one thought.' In my view, the meaning which best accords with the usual sense of the word, is that proposed by Lowth, that no one should be allowed to interpose, or intercede for them.
