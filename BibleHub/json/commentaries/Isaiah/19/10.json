The Egyptians will be given over into the hand of one who shall rule them with rigour, as was shortly after fulfilled. The Egyptians were renowned for wisdom and science; yet the Lord would give them up to their own perverse schemes, and to quarrel, till their land would be brought by their contests to become an object of contempt and pity. He renders sinners afraid of those whom they have despised and oppressed; and the Lord of hosts will make the workers of iniquity a terror to themselves, and to each other; and every object around a terror to them.",

This ζύθον  zuthon was a sort of malt liquor made of fruits by fermentation, and was used in Egypt in the place of wine, since the grape did not flourish there. Jerome on this place says, that this was much used also in Dalmatia and Pannonia, and was commonly called \"Sabaium.\" The Chaldee renders this, 'And the place where they weave cloth shall be trodden down, and the place where they make fish ponds, and where they collect waters, each one for his own life.' This variety of reading arises chiefly from the different modes of \"pointing\" the Hebrew words.",

The word rendered 'sluices' (שׂכר  s'eker), our translators understand in the sense of places where the water would be retained for fish ponds - made by artificial banks confining the waters that overflow from the Nile. This sense they have given to the word, as if it were derived from סכר  sâkar, \"to shut up, to enclose.\" The Septuagint reads it as if it meant the Hebrew שׁכר  shêkār, or strong drink; and so also the Syriac renders it - as if from שׁכר  shēkâr, \"to drink.\" There is no doubt that by a difference of pointing it may have this signification. But the most probable interpretation, perhaps, is that which derives it from     שׂכר  s'âkar, \"to hire,\" and means that they made those places for reward, or for gain. They thus tolled for hire; and the prophet says, that they who thus made enclosures for fish in order to make a livelihood, would be trodden down - that is, they would fail of their purposes.",
