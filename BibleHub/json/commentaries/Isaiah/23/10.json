Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that are uneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgments pursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this trouble come? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convince men of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory.

Everything, says he, would be leveled, and the field would not be distinguishable from the city. Grotius thus renders it: 'Pass to some one of thy colonies; as a river flows from the fountain to the sea, so do you go to the ocean.'
