Bezaleel- Exodus 31:2; Cyrus- Isaiah 45:3; Servant of the Lord- Isaiah 49:1.II. What does God’s calling a man by His name imply?1. God’s possession of him. That possession by God involves God’s protection and man’s safety. He does not hold His property slackly. ‘None shall pluck them out of My Father’s hand.’2. Kindred. The man bears the family name. He is adopted into the household. The sonship of the receiver of the new name is dimly shadowed.3. Likeness. The Biblical meaning of ‘name’ is ‘character manifested.’ Nomen and omen coincide. We must bring into connection with the texts the prominence given in the Apocalypse to analogous promises. ‘I will write on him the name of My God.’ That means a fuller disclosing of God’s character, and a clear impress of that character on perfected men ‘His name shall be in their foreheads.’Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary43:1-7 God's favour and good-will to his people speak abundant comfort to all believers. The new creature, wherever it is, is of God's forming. All who are redeemed with the blood of his Son, he has set apart for himself. Those that have God for them need not fear who or what can be against them.  What are Egypt and Ethiopia, all their lives and treasures, compared with the blood of Christ? True believers are precious in God's sight, his delight is in them, above any people. Though they went as through fire and water, yet, while they had God with them, they need fear no evil; they should be born up, and brought out. The faithful are encouraged. They were to be assembled from every quarter. And with this pleasing object in view, the prophet again dissuades from anxious fears.Barnes' Notes on the BibleEvery one that is called by my name - To be called by the name of anyone, is synonymous with being regarded as his son, since a son bears the name of his father (see Isaiah 44:5; Isaiah 48:1). The expression, therefore, means here, all who were regarded as the children of God; and the promise is, that all such should be re-gathered to their own land.For I have created him - (See the note at Isaiah 43:1).For my glory - In order to show forth, and illustrate my glory. They shall be, therefore, defended and protected; and my glory shall be shown in their recovery and salvation. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary7. called by my name—belong to Israel, whose people, as sons of God, bear the name of their Father (Isa 44:5; 48:1).for my glory—(Isa 43:21; Isa 29:23).Matthew Poole's Commentary Even every one that is called by my name: They are called by my name;  I own them for my people and children; and therefore what kindness or cruelty you exercise to them I take it as done to myself. So it is an argument to move those people to let their captives go; or it is an argument to confirm the faith of God’s people, that God would deliver them, because they are his own. I have created him for my glory;  and therefore I will glorify my power, and goodness, and faithfulness in delivering them. I have made him;  I have not only created them out of nothing, as I did all other people, but I have also formed and made them my peculiar people. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleEven everyone that is called by my name,.... That is called by the name of God, a son or daughter of his; or by the name of Christ, a Christian; whoever belongs to the Lord, whom he calls by his name; and who, being called by his grace, call upon his name, make a profession of his name, and serve and worship him: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him; all which is expressive of the power and grace of God, in the regeneration and conversion of his people; which is a creation, a formation, a making them for himself, for the glory of his grace, and to show forth his praise; and therefore he will gather them in, and bring them into a body together, into a church state, that this end may be answered. Geneva Study BibleEven every one that is called by my {g} name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; verily, I have made him.(g) Meaning that he could not be unmindful of them, unless he would neglect his own Name and glory.",
