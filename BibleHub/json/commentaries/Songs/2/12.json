This may be applied to the prospect the Old Testament saints had of Christ's coming in the flesh. He comes as pleased with his own undertaking. He comes speedily. Even when Christ seems to forsake, it is but for a moment; he will soon return with everlasting loving-kindness. The saints of old saw him, appearing through the sacrifices and ceremonial institutions. We see him through a glass darkly, as he manifests himself through the lattices. Christ invites the new convert to arise from sloth and despondency, and to leave sin and worldly vanities, for union and communion with him. The winter may mean years passed in ignorance and sin, unfruitful and miserable, or storms and tempests that accompanied his conviction of guilt and danger. Even the unripe fruits of holiness are pleasant unto Him whose grace has produced them. All these encouraging tokens and evidences of Divine favour, are motives to the soul to follow Christ more fully. Arise then, and come away from the world and the flesh, come into fellowship with Christ. This blessed change is owing wholly to the approaches and influences of the Sun of righteousness.",

Its plaintive \"voice\" answers to his preaching of repentance (Jer 8:6, 7). Vulgate and Septuagint translate, \"The time of pruning,\" namely, spring (Joh 15:2). The mention of the \"turtle's\" cooing better accords with our text. The turtledove is migratory (Jer 8:7), and \"comes\" early in May; emblem of love, and so of the Holy Ghost. Love, too, shall be the keynote of the \"new song\" hereafter (Isa 35:10; Re 1:5; 14:3; 19:6).

In fact, we say of a wrinkled countenance that it is mathal alkarash albayt.\" With right Wetstein gathers from this curious fact how difficult it is to ascertain by purely etymological considerations the view which guided the Semites in this or that designation.
