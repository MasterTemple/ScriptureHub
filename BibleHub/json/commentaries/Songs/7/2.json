Consistent believers honour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners.

Christ takes delight in the assemblies and ordinances of his people; and admires the fruit of his grace in them.

Perhaps Delitzsch is right in thinking that there may be an attempt to describe the navel itself as like the whirling hollow of water in a basin. In the latter part of the verse the shape of the body is undoubtedly intended. \"To the present day winnowed and sifted corn is piled up in great heaps of symmetrical, half-spherical form, which are then frequently stuck over with things that move in the wind, for the purpose of protecting them against birds. The appearance of such heaps of wheat,\" says Wetstein, \"which one may see in long parallel rows on the threshing floors of a village, is very pleasing to a peasant; and the comparison of the song every Arabian will regard as beautiful.\" According to the Moslem Sunnas, the colour of wheat was that of Adam.
