Some understand this of the two natures in Christ, divine and human; with respect to his divine nature, \"white\", expressive of his simplicity, purity and holiness; which colour, Cicero says (r), is chiefly becoming God, it being simple, and having no mixture and composition in it: with respect to his human nature, \"red\", being a partaker of the same flesh and blood with his people. Others, only of the human nature; \"white\" denoting the purity and holiness of it, being without either original or actual sin; \"red\", or \"ruddy\", his bloody sufferings in it for the sins of his people. But it may denote, in general, his fairness, beauty, and glory; being, as a divine Person, the brightness of his Father's glory; as man; fairer than the children of men; as the Mediator, full of grace and truth; and in all his offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King, and in all the relations he stands in to his, as Father, Husband, Brother, and Friend, he appears most lovely and amiable; ",
