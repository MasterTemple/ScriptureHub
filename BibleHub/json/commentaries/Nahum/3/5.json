But who would meet God Almighty, who hath power over all, if He would war against him?\" In the Medes and Persians it was God who was against them. \"Behold I am against thee,\" literally, \"toward thee.\" It is a new thing which God was about to do. \"Behold!\" God in His long-suffering had seemed to overlook her. Now, He says, I am toward thee, looking at her with His all-searching eye, as her Judge. Violence is punished by suffering; deeds of shame by shame. All sin is a whited sepulchre, fair without, foul within. God will strip off the outward fairness, and lay bare the inward foulness. The deepest shame is to lay bare, what the sinner or the world veiled within. \"I will discover thy skirts,\" i. e., the long-flowing robes which were part of her pomp and dignity, but which were only the veil of her misdeeds. \"Through the greatness of thine iniquity have thy skirts been discovered,\" says Jeremiah in answer to the heart's question, \"why have these things come upon me?\" Upon thy face, where shame is felt. The conscience of thy foulness shall be laid bare before thy face, thy eyes, thy memory continually, so that thou shalt be forced to read therein, whatsoever thou hast done, said, thought. \"I will show the nations thy nakedness,\" that all may despise, avoid, take example by thee, and praise God for His righteous judgments upon thee.
