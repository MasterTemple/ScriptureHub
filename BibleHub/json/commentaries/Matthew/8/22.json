Those who are really living will do the work to which their Master calls them, and leave the lower conventional duties to be done or left undone as the events of their life shall order.” Something there was, we may be sure, in the inward state of the disciple which called for the sternness of the rebuke.

Many resolutions for religion are produced by sudden conviction, and taken up without due consideration; these come to nothing. When this scribe offered to follow Christ, one would think he should have been encouraged; one scribe might do more credit and service than twelve fishermen; but Christ saw his heart, and answered to its thoughts, and therein teaches all how to come to Christ. His resolve seems to have been from a worldly, covetous principle; but Christ had not a place to lay his head on, and if he follows him, he must not expect to fare better than he fared. We have reason to think this scribe went away. Another was too slow. Delay in doing is as bad on the one hand, as hastiness in resolving is on the other. He asked leave to attend his father to his grave, and then he would be at Christ's service. This seemed reasonable, yet it was not right. He had not true zeal for the work. Burying the dead, especially a dead father, is a good work, but it is not thy work at this time. If Christ requires our service, affection even for the nearest and dearest relatives, and for things otherwise our duty, must give way. An unwilling mind never wants an excuse. Jesus said to him, Follow me; and, no doubt, power went with this word to him as to others; he did follow Christ, and cleaved to him. The scribe said, I will follow thee; to this man Christ said, Follow me; comparing them together, it shows that we are brought to Christ by the force of his call to us, Ro 9:16.",

The arrangements for the funeral, the preparation of mourning apparel, and the depth of sorrow in such cases, divert the mind from its sins and its personal need of a Saviour; and hence few persons are awakened or converted as the result of death in a family. The case here was a \"strong\" one - it was as strong as can well be conceived; and the Saviour meant to teach by this that nothing is to be allowed to divert the mind from religion nothing to be an excuse for not following him. Not even the death of a father, and the sorrows of an afflicted family, are to be suffered to lead a man to defer religion, or to put off the purpose to be a Christian. That is a fixed duty - a duty not to be deferred or neglected, whether in sickness or health, at home or abroad whether surrounded by living and happy kindred, or whether a father, a mother, a child, or a sister lies in our house dead.",

And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head—Few as there were of the scribes who attached themselves to Jesus, it would appear, from his calling Him Teacher, that this one was a \"disciple\" in that looser sense of the word in which it is applied to the crowds who flocked after Him, with more or less conviction that His claims were well founded. But from the answer which he received we are led to infer that there was more of transient emotion—of temporary impulse—than of intelligent principle in the speech. The preaching of Christ had riveted and charmed him; his heart had swelled; his enthusiasm had been kindled; and in this state of mind he will go anywhere with Him, and feels impelled to tell Him so. \"Wilt thou?\" replies the Lord Jesus. \"Knowest thou whom thou art pledging thyself to follow, and whither haply He may lead thee? No warm home, no downy pillow has He for thee: He has them not for Himself. The foxes are not without their holes, nor do the birds of the air lack their nests; but the Son of man has to depend on the hospitality of others, and borrow the pillow whereon He lays His head.\" How affecting is this reply! And yet He rejects not this man's offer, nor refuses him the liberty to follow Him. Only He will have him know what he is doing, and \"count the cost.\" He will have him weigh well the real nature and the strength of his attachment, whether it be such as will abide in the day of trial. If so, he will be right welcome, for Christ puts none away. But it seems too plain that in this case that had not been done. And so we have called this the Rash or Precipitate Disciple.",

But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead—or, as more definitely in Luke, \"Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God\" (Lu 9:60). This disciple did not, like the former, volunteer his services, but is called by the Lord Jesus, not only to follow, but to preach Him. And he is quite willing; only he is not ready just yet. \"Lord, I will; but\"—\"There is a difficulty in the way just now; but that once removed, I am Thine.\" What now is this difficulty? Was his father actually dead—lying a corpse—having only to be buried? Impossible. As it was the practice, as noticed on Lu 7:12, to bury on the day of death, it is not very likely that this disciple would have been here at all if his father had just breathed his last; nor would the Lord, if He was there, have hindered him discharging the last duties of a son to a father. No doubt it was the common case of a son having a frail or aged father, not likely to live long, whose head he thinks it his duty to see under the ground ere he goes abroad. \"This aged father of mine will soon be removed; and if I might but delay till I see him decently interred, I should then be free to preach the kingdom of God wherever duty might call me.\" This view of the case will explain the curt reply, \"Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.\" Like all the other paradoxical sayings of our Lord, the key to it is the different senses—a higher and a lower—in which the same word \"dead\" is used: There are two kingdoms of God in existence upon earth; the kingdom of nature, and the kingdom of grace: To the one kingdom all the children of this world, even the most ungodly, are fully alive; to the other, only the children of light: The reigning irreligion consists not in indifference to the common humanities of social life, but to things spiritual and eternal: Fear not, therefore, that your father will in your absence be neglected, and that when he breathes his last there will not be relatives and friends ready enough to do to him the last offices of kindness. Your wish to discharge these yourself is natural, and to be allowed to do it a privilege not lightly to be foregone. But the kingdom of God lies now all neglected and needy: Its more exalted character few discern; to its paramount claims few are alive: and to \"preach\" it fewer still are qualified and called: But thou art: The Lord therefore hath need of thee: Leave, then, those claims of nature, high though they be, to those who are dead to the still higher claims of the kingdom of grace, which God is now erecting upon earth—Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.

        "text": "  And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and   looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. But for the very different   replies given, we should hardly have discerned the difference between this   and the second case: the one man called, indeed, and the other   volunteering, as did the first; but both seemingly alike willing, and only   having a difficulty in their way just at that moment. But, by help of what   is said respectively to each, we perceive the great difference between the   two cases. From the warning given against \"looking back,\" it is evident   that this man's discipleship was not yet thorough, his separation from the   world not entire. It is not a case of going back, but of looking back; and   as there is here a manifest reference to the case of \"Lot's wife\" (Ge   19:26; and see on [1236]Lu 17:32), we see that it is not actual return to   the world that we have here to deal with, but a reluctance to break with   it. The figure of putting one's hand to the plough and looking back is an   exceedingly vivid one, and to an agricultural people most impressive. As   ploughing requires an eye intent on the furrow to be made, and is marred   the instant one turns about, so will they come short of salvation who   prosecute the work of God with a distracted attention, a divided heart.   The reference may be chiefly to ministers; but the application at least is   general. As the image seems plainly to have been suggested by the case of   Elijah and Elisha, a difficulty may be raised, requiring a moment's   attention. When Elijah cast his mantle about Elisha, which the youth quite   understood to mean appointing him his successor, he was ploughing with   twelve yoke of oxen, the last pair held by himself. Leaving his oxen, he   ran after the prophet, and said, \"Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and   my mother, and [then] I will follow thee.\" Was this said in the same   spirit with the same speech uttered by our disciple? Let us see. \"And   Elijah said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee.\"   Commentators take this to mean that Elijah had really done nothing to   hinder him from going on with all his ordinary duties. But to us it seems   clear that Elijah's intention was to try what manner of spirit the youth   was of:—\"Kiss thy father and mother? And why not? By all means, go home   and stay with them; for what have I done to thee? I did but throw a mantle   about thee; but what of that?\" If this was his meaning, Elisha thoroughly   apprehended and nobly met it. \"He returned back from him, and took a yoke   of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the   oxen (the wood of his ploughing implements), and gave unto the people, and   they did eat: then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto   him\" (1Ki 19:19-21). We know not if even his father and mother had time to   be called to this hasty feast. But this much is plain, that, though in   affluent circumstances, he gave up his lower calling, with all its   prospects, for the higher and at that time perilous, office to which he   was called. What now is the bearing of these two cases? Did Elisha do   wrong in bidding them farewell with whom he was associated in his early   calling? Or, if not, would this disciple have done wrong if he had done   the same thing, and in the same spirit, with Elisha? Clearly not. Elisha's   doing it proved that he could with safety do it; and our Lord's warning is   not against bidding them farewell which were at home at his house, but   against the probable fatal consequences of that step; lest the embraces of   earthly relationship should prove too strong for him, and he should never   return to follow Christ. Accordingly, we have called this the Irresolute   or Wavering Disciple.",

And however strange and odd such a phrase may sound in the ears of some, of one dead man's burying another, it was easily understood by a Jew; with whom it is common to say,  , \"that a sinner is counted as (g) dead, and that ungodly persons, even while they are alive\", , are \"called dead\" (h). And in this sense is the word used, in the former part of this phrase; and Christ's meaning is, let such who are dead in trespasses and sins, and to all that is spiritually good, bury those who are dead in a natural or corporal sense. It is likely the deceased was an unregenerate man; however, it is plainly suggested, that many of the relations were; and there were enough of them to take care of this service: and therefore, there was no need why he should neglect the ministry of the Gospel to attend that; but, ought to leave it to persons who were fitter for it.

In a figurative sense by the “dead” are intended those who are outside the kingdom, who are dead to the true life. Perhaps a brother or brothers of the disciple had rejected Christ, “let them bury their father.” Another way of understanding the proverb is: Let those who are dead in Christ, dead to the world, bury their dead—their affections and lusts, all that connects them with that dead past. St Luke, after “let the dead bury their dead,” adds, “but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.” Perhaps no incident marks more decisively the height of self-abandonment required by Jesus of His followers. In this instance the disciple is called upon to renounce for Christ’s sake the last and most sacred of filial duties. The unswerving devotion to Christ is illustrated in the parallel passage (",
