        "text": "As found in the Old Testament, the term is the literal translation of the Hebrew ben-adam, the latter word expressing the generic weakness and frailty of man’s nature, as the Hebrew ish expresses its greatness and its strength. It stands therefore as representing man idealised under that one aspect of his being. “What is man that Thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that Thou visitest him?” (Psalm 8:4); “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man in whom is no help” (Psalm 146:3), are instances of its use in this meaning. In some passages our version expresses the same thought by rendering the “sons of Adam” and the “sons of Ish “as” low and high” (Psalm 49:2), or the former word alone as “men of low degree” (Psalm 62:9). The title received a new prominence about the time of the Captivity from its use in Ezekiel’s prophecies. There it appears frequently (not fewer than eighty-seven times in all) as the title with which the prophet is addressed by the voice of Jehovah. We can scarcely doubt that it was used there in all the fulness of its earlier meaning, and was designed to teach the prophet that, amid all the greatness of his work, he was still subject to all the weakness and temptations of man’s nature, and ought therefore to have compassion on their infirmities. Yet a fresh aspect of the name was presented in the mysterious vision of Daniel 7:13, in which “One like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and was brought to the Ancient of Days, . . . and there was given unto Him dominion and glory and a kingdom.” The word used is not, it is true, benadam, but bar-enosh, but there is no traceable distinction of meaning between the two. Here, then, the thought manifestly was this, that One who shared man’s weakness, should also be a sharer of God’s glory, and be the Head of the divine kingdom. The prominence which the Maccabean struggles gave to the predictions of Daniel drew attention to the name as it had thus been used. The “Son of Man” became one of the titles of the expected Christ. The Targum or Paraphrase of the Psalms (probably earlier than our Lord’s ministry) explains even such a passage as Psalm 80:17 (“the son of man whom thou madest so strong for thine own self”) as referring to the Christ. So when the crowd at Jerusalem are questioning in their hearts whether Jesus was the Christ, they are not startled at this application of the name, and their question, “Who is this Son of Man?” is the utterance of their wonder that things so unlike what they expected of the Christ should be predicted of One who claimed the title (John 12:34). It was accordingly, with these ideas attached to it—involving at once fellowship with the lowest of the heirs of our humanity, and yet also participation in the eternal glory of the Highest—that our Lord claimed the title, and used it with such marvellous frequency. We might almost say that it serves as the chief connecting-link between the teaching of the first three Gospels and the fourth. It appears thirty-two times in St. Matthew, fourteen in St. Mark, twenty-six in St. Luke, and twelve times in St. John. It is remarkable that it never passed into the current language of the Apostolic Church, nor into the theological or liturgical phraseology of Christendom. It is not used in any one of the Epistles. Outside the Gospels it is found only in the exclamation of Stephen (Acts 7:56), with a manifest reference to Daniel 7:13, and possibly in the visions of the Apocalypse (Revelation 1:13; Revelation 14:14). The minds of believers loved to dwell on the glory of the risen Christ, and apparently looked on this as belonging rather to the time of His humiliation. Its absence from the other books of the New Testament, and its presence in the Gospels is, at all events, an indication that the latter were not the after-growth of a later age.",

Many resolutions for religion are produced by sudden conviction, and taken up without due consideration; these come to nothing. When this scribe offered to follow Christ, one would think he should have been encouraged; one scribe might do more credit and service than twelve fishermen; but Christ saw his heart, and answered to its thoughts, and therein teaches all how to come to Christ. His resolve seems to have been from a worldly, covetous principle; but Christ had not a place to lay his head on, and if he follows him, he must not expect to fare better than he fared. We have reason to think this scribe went away. Another was too slow. Delay in doing is as bad on the one hand, as hastiness in resolving is on the other. He asked leave to attend his father to his grave, and then he would be at Christ's service. This seemed reasonable, yet it was not right. He had not true zeal for the work. Burying the dead, especially a dead father, is a good work, but it is not thy work at this time. If Christ requires our service, affection even for the nearest and dearest relatives, and for things otherwise our duty, must give way. An unwilling mind never wants an excuse. Jesus said to him, Follow me; and, no doubt, power went with this word to him as to others; he did follow Christ, and cleaved to him. The scribe said, I will follow thee; to this man Christ said, Follow me; comparing them together, it shows that we are brought to Christ by the force of his call to us, Ro 9:16.",

And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head—Few as there were of the scribes who attached themselves to Jesus, it would appear, from his calling Him Teacher, that this one was a \"disciple\" in that looser sense of the word in which it is applied to the crowds who flocked after Him, with more or less conviction that His claims were well founded. But from the answer which he received we are led to infer that there was more of transient emotion—of temporary impulse—than of intelligent principle in the speech. The preaching of Christ had riveted and charmed him; his heart had swelled; his enthusiasm had been kindled; and in this state of mind he will go anywhere with Him, and feels impelled to tell Him so. \"Wilt thou?\" replies the Lord Jesus. \"Knowest thou whom thou art pledging thyself to follow, and whither haply He may lead thee? No warm home, no downy pillow has He for thee: He has them not for Himself. The foxes are not without their holes, nor do the birds of the air lack their nests; but the Son of man has to depend on the hospitality of others, and borrow the pillow whereon He lays His head.\" How affecting is this reply! And yet He rejects not this man's offer, nor refuses him the liberty to follow Him. Only He will have him know what he is doing, and \"count the cost.\" He will have him weigh well the real nature and the strength of his attachment, whether it be such as will abide in the day of trial. If so, he will be right welcome, for Christ puts none away. But it seems too plain that in this case that had not been done. And so we have called this the Rash or Precipitate Disciple.",

But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead—or, as more definitely in Luke, \"Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God\" (Lu 9:60). This disciple did not, like the former, volunteer his services, but is called by the Lord Jesus, not only to follow, but to preach Him. And he is quite willing; only he is not ready just yet. \"Lord, I will; but\"—\"There is a difficulty in the way just now; but that once removed, I am Thine.\" What now is this difficulty? Was his father actually dead—lying a corpse—having only to be buried? Impossible. As it was the practice, as noticed on Lu 7:12, to bury on the day of death, it is not very likely that this disciple would have been here at all if his father had just breathed his last; nor would the Lord, if He was there, have hindered him discharging the last duties of a son to a father. No doubt it was the common case of a son having a frail or aged father, not likely to live long, whose head he thinks it his duty to see under the ground ere he goes abroad. \"This aged father of mine will soon be removed; and if I might but delay till I see him decently interred, I should then be free to preach the kingdom of God wherever duty might call me.\" This view of the case will explain the curt reply, \"Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.\" Like all the other paradoxical sayings of our Lord, the key to it is the different senses—a higher and a lower—in which the same word \"dead\" is used: There are two kingdoms of God in existence upon earth; the kingdom of nature, and the kingdom of grace: To the one kingdom all the children of this world, even the most ungodly, are fully alive; to the other, only the children of light: The reigning irreligion consists not in indifference to the common humanities of social life, but to things spiritual and eternal: Fear not, therefore, that your father will in your absence be neglected, and that when he breathes his last there will not be relatives and friends ready enough to do to him the last offices of kindness. Your wish to discharge these yourself is natural, and to be allowed to do it a privilege not lightly to be foregone. But the kingdom of God lies now all neglected and needy: Its more exalted character few discern; to its paramount claims few are alive: and to \"preach\" it fewer still are qualified and called: But thou art: The Lord therefore hath need of thee: Leave, then, those claims of nature, high though they be, to those who are dead to the still higher claims of the kingdom of grace, which God is now erecting upon earth—Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.

        "text": "  And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and   looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. But for the very different   replies given, we should hardly have discerned the difference between this   and the second case: the one man called, indeed, and the other   volunteering, as did the first; but both seemingly alike willing, and only   having a difficulty in their way just at that moment. But, by help of what   is said respectively to each, we perceive the great difference between the   two cases. From the warning given against \"looking back,\" it is evident   that this man's discipleship was not yet thorough, his separation from the   world not entire. It is not a case of going back, but of looking back; and   as there is here a manifest reference to the case of \"Lot's wife\" (Ge   19:26; and see on [1236]Lu 17:32), we see that it is not actual return to   the world that we have here to deal with, but a reluctance to break with   it. The figure of putting one's hand to the plough and looking back is an   exceedingly vivid one, and to an agricultural people most impressive. As   ploughing requires an eye intent on the furrow to be made, and is marred   the instant one turns about, so will they come short of salvation who   prosecute the work of God with a distracted attention, a divided heart.   The reference may be chiefly to ministers; but the application at least is   general. As the image seems plainly to have been suggested by the case of   Elijah and Elisha, a difficulty may be raised, requiring a moment's   attention. When Elijah cast his mantle about Elisha, which the youth quite   understood to mean appointing him his successor, he was ploughing with   twelve yoke of oxen, the last pair held by himself. Leaving his oxen, he   ran after the prophet, and said, \"Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and   my mother, and [then] I will follow thee.\" Was this said in the same   spirit with the same speech uttered by our disciple? Let us see. \"And   Elijah said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee.\"   Commentators take this to mean that Elijah had really done nothing to   hinder him from going on with all his ordinary duties. But to us it seems   clear that Elijah's intention was to try what manner of spirit the youth   was of:—\"Kiss thy father and mother? And why not? By all means, go home   and stay with them; for what have I done to thee? I did but throw a mantle   about thee; but what of that?\" If this was his meaning, Elisha thoroughly   apprehended and nobly met it. \"He returned back from him, and took a yoke   of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the   oxen (the wood of his ploughing implements), and gave unto the people, and   they did eat: then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto   him\" (1Ki 19:19-21). We know not if even his father and mother had time to   be called to this hasty feast. But this much is plain, that, though in   affluent circumstances, he gave up his lower calling, with all its   prospects, for the higher and at that time perilous, office to which he   was called. What now is the bearing of these two cases? Did Elisha do   wrong in bidding them farewell with whom he was associated in his early   calling? Or, if not, would this disciple have done wrong if he had done   the same thing, and in the same spirit, with Elisha? Clearly not. Elisha's   doing it proved that he could with safety do it; and our Lord's warning is   not against bidding them farewell which were at home at his house, but   against the probable fatal consequences of that step; lest the embraces of   earthly relationship should prove too strong for him, and he should never   return to follow Christ. Accordingly, we have called this the Irresolute   or Wavering Disciple.",
