Let us with cheerful confidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far from breaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching the smoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into a flame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receive one another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the gracious kindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us, and make us able to copy his example.",

When they saw him retiring before them, and, instead of subduing them by force, seeking a place of concealment, it was contrary to all their previous notions of the Messiah. Matthew by this quotation shows that \"their\" conceptions of him had been wrong. Instead of a warrior and an earthly conqueror, he was \"predicted\" under a totally different character. Instead of shouting for battle, lifting up his voice in the streets, oppressing the feeble - \"breaking bruised reeds and quenching smoking flax, as a conqueror\" - he would be peaceful, retiring; would strengthen the feeble, and would cherish the faintest desires of holiness.
