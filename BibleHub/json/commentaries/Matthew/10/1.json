They were not men of rank and office, and could not compel people to believe.

Mark saith, Mark 3:14,15, And he ordained twelve,  that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, and to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils. Luke repeats almost the same words,  Luke 9:1,2; only he saith he gave them power and authority over devils, —and to preach the kingdom of God. This was the first mission which the apostles had, much different from that given them after his resurrection; they were now sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, then they were sent to all nations. They were not called disciples as that term signified only the common hearers of Christ, but in a more emphatic sense. He chooseth out twelve,  that as the twelve patriarchs begat the Jewish church, so these twelve men might be the fathers to all the gospel church. The number of twelve seems a sacred number. The new Jerusalem, Revelation 21:12, is described as having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels,  and to have written (on the gates) the names of the twelve tribes;  and, Revelation 21:14, the wall of the city is said to have had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles;  the dimensions of it twelve thousand furlongs,  Revelation 21:16. The power he gave to the apostles was: 1. To preach the kingdom, that is, the gospel, which as it showeth the way to the kingdom of glory, so it was the means to gather the Christian church, which is the kingdom of grace, and to subdue men’s hearts to the obedience of Christ. 2. To cast out devils, and heal all manner of sicknesses. By which they gained repute amoungst people, confirming people that they were sent of God, doing (though not as Christ did them) things which none but God could do, by a derivation of power from him: Christ did the same things, but by a power inherent in himself. These twelve were ordinarily to be with Christ, and to go forth (as occasion served) clothed with his power to preach and to work miracles. ",
