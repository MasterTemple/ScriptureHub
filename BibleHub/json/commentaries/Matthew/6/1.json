Its excellence had been that it laid stress, as the religion of Islam did afterwards, on the three great duties of the religious life, almsgiving, fasting, and prayer, rather than on sacrifices and offerings. Verbally, Pharisaism accepted on this point the widest and most spiritual teaching of the prophets, and so its home was in the Synagogue rather than the Temple, and it gained a hold on the minds of the people which the priests never gained. But a subtle evil found its way even here. Love of praise and power, rather than spontaneous love, and self-denial, and adoration, was the mainspring of their action, and so that which is the essence of all religion was absent even from the acts in which the purest and highest form of religion naturally shows itself.",

Take heed that ye do not your alms—But the true reading seems clearly to be \"your righteousness.\" The external authority for both readings is pretty nearly equal; but internal evidence is decidedly in favor of \"righteousness.\" The subject of the second verse being \"almsgiving\" that word—so like the other in Greek—might easily be substituted for it by the copyist: whereas the opposite would not be so likely. But it is still more in favor of \"righteousness,\" that if we so read the first verse, it then becomes a general heading for this whole section of the discourse, inculcating unostentatiousness in all deeds of righteousness—Almsgiving, Prayer, and Fasting being, in that case, but selected examples of this righteousness; whereas, if we read, \"Do not your alms,\" &c., this first verse will have no reference but to that one point. By \"righteousness,\" in this case, we are to understand that same righteousness of the kingdom of heaven, whose leading features—in opposition to traditional perversions of it—it is the great object of this discourse to open up: that righteousness of which the Lord says, \"Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven\" (Mt 5:20). To \"do\" this righteousness, was an old and well-understood expression. Thus, \"Blessed is he that doeth righteousness at all times\" (Ps 106:3). It refers to the actings of righteousness in the life—the outgoings of the gracious nature—of which our Lord afterwards said to His disciples, \"Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples\" (Joh 15:8).",
