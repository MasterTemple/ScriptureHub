Such as when the flesh was sold in the market as common food, for the priest to whom it had been given. But a Christian must not merely consider what is lawful, but what is expedient, and to edify others. Christianity by no means forbids the common offices of kindness, or allows uncourteous behaviour to any, however they may differ from us in religious sentiments or practices. But this is not to be understood of religious festivals, partaking in idolatrous worship. According to this advice of the apostle, Christians should take care not to use their liberty to the hurt of others, or to their own reproach. In eating and drinking, and in all we do, we should aim at the glory of God, at pleasing and honouring him. This is the great end of all religion, and directs us where express rules are wanting. A holy, peaceable, and benevolent spirit, will disarm the greatest enemies.",

The Greek terms for \"the other\" and \"another\" are distinct. \"The other\" is the one with whom Paul's and his Corinthian converts' concern is; \"another\" is any other with whom he and they have no concern. If a guest know the meat to be idol meat while I know it not, I have \"liberty\" to eat without being condemned by his \"conscience\" [Grotius]. Thus the \"for,\" &c., is an argument for 1Co 10:27, \"Eat, asking no questions.\" Or, Why should I give occasion by the rash use of my liberty that another should condemn it [Estius], or that my liberty should cause the destruction of my weak brother?\" [Menochius]. Or, the words are those of the Corinthian objector (perhaps used in their letter, and so quoted by Paul), \"Why is my liberty judged by another's conscience?\" Why should not I be judged only by my own, and have liberty to do whatever it sanctions? Paul replies in 1Co 10:31, Your doing so ought always to be limited by regard to what most tends \"to the glory of God\" [Vatablus, Conybeare and Howson]. The first explanation is simplest; the \"for,\" &c., in it refers to \"not thine own\" (that is, \"not my own,\" in Paul's change to the first person); I am to abstain only in the case of liability to offend another's conscience; in cases where my own has no scruple, I am not bound, in God's judgment, by any other conscience than my own.",
