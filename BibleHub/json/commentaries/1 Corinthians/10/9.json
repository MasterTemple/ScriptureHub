On the whole, the reading here adopted (the Lord) seems from internal evidence to have been most likely the true reading. It is possible that the word “God” crept into the text, having been put as a marginal explanation to get over the supposed difficulty involved in applying the words which follow, “they also tempted,” to Christ. For in what sense could it have been said that the Israelites tempted Christ? There is no reason, however, for connecting “some of them tempted” (the word “also” is not in the original) with the object of the previous clause: and it is noticeable that the second word translated “tempted” is not the same as the first. “Let us not tempt” is in the original an intensified form of the verb which is used in its simple form in “some of them tempted.” The reading “Christ” may have come into the text as being an explanation that by the word “Lord” St. Paul meant the Redeemer.",

And it is but just to fear, that such as tempt Christ, will be left by him in the power of the old serpent. Murmuring against God's disposals and commands, greatly provokes him. Nothing in Scripture is written in vain; and it is our wisdom and duty to learn from it. Others have fallen, and so may we. The Christian's security against sin is distrust of himself. God has not promised to keep us from falling, if we do not look to ourselves. To this word of caution, a word of comfort is added. Others have the like burdens, and the like temptations: what they bear up under, and break through, we may also. God is wise as well as faithful, and will make our burdens according to our strength. He knows what we can bear. He will make a way to escape; he will deliver either from the trial itself, or at least the mischief of it. We have full encouragement to flee from sin, and to be faithful to God. We cannot fall by temptation, if we cleave fast to him. Whether the world smiles or frowns, it is an enemy; but believers shall be strengthened to overcome it, with all its terrors and enticements. The fear of the Lord, put into their hearts, will be the great means of safety.",

The Israelites tempted him, or \"tried his patience and forbearance,\" by rebellion, complaining, impatience, and dissatisfaction with his dealings. In what way the Corinthians were in danger of tempting Christ is not known, and can only be conjectured. It may be that the apostle cautions them against exposing themselves to temptation in the idol temples - placing themselves, as it were, under the unhappy influence of idolatry, and thus needlessly trying the strength of their religion, and making an experiment on the grace of Christ, as if he were bound to keep them even in the midst of dangers into which they needlessly ran. They would have the promise of grace to keep them only when they were in the way of their duty, and using all proper precautions. To go beyond this, to place themselves in needless danger, to presume on the grace of Christ to keep them in all circumstances, would be to tempt him, and provoke him to leave them; see the note at ",

It cannot be denied, however, that the more natural construction of this place is that which supposes that the word \"Christ\" is understood here rather than \"God.\" In order to relieve this interpretation from the difficulty that the Israelites could not be said with any propriety to have tempted \"Christ,\" since he had not then come in the flesh, two remarks may be made.",

And secondly, We are to bear in mind that the term \"Christ\" has acquired with us a signification somewhat different from that which it originally had in the New Testament. We use it as \"a proper name,\" applied to Jesus of Nazareth. But it is to be remembered that it is the mere Greek word for the Hebrew \"Anointed,\" or the \"Messiah;\" and by retaining this signification of the word here, no small part of the difficulty will be avoided; and the expression then will mean simply that the Israelites tempted \"the Messiah;\" and the idea will be that he who conducted them, and against whom they sinned, and whom they tempted, was \"the Messiah,\" who afterward became incarnate; an idea that is in accordance with the ancient ideas of the Jews respecting this personage, and which is not forbidden, certainly, in any part of the Bible.",

We use it as \"a proper name,\" applied to Jesus of Nazareth. But it is to be remembered that it is the mere Greek word for the Hebrew \"Anointed,\" or the \"Messiah;\" and by retaining this signification of the word here, no small part of the difficulty will be avoided; and the expression then will mean simply that the Israelites tempted \"the Messiah;\" and the idea will be that he who conducted them, and against whom they sinned, and whom they tempted, was \"the Messiah,\" who afterward became incarnate; an idea that is in accordance with the ancient ideas of the Jews respecting this personage, and which is not forbidden, certainly, in any part of the Bible.",

Some of the oldest manuscripts read \"Lord\"; and one manuscript only \"God.\" If \"Lord\" be read, it will mean Christ. As \"Christ\" was referred to in one of the five privileges of Israel (1Co 10:4), so it is natural that He should be mentioned here in one of the five corresponding sins of that people. In Nu 21:5 it is \"spake against God\" (whence probably arose the alteration in the one manuscript, 1Co 10:9, \"God,\" to harmonize it with Nu 21:5). As either \"Christ\" or \"Lord\" is the genuine reading, \"Christ\" must be \"God.\" Compare \"Why do ye tempt the Lord?\" (Ex 17:2, 7. Compare Ro 14:11, with Isa 45:22, 23). Israel's discontented complainings were temptings of Christ especially, the \"Angel\" of the covenant (Ex 23:20, 21; 32:34; Isa 63:9). Though they drank of \"that Rock … Christ\" (1Co 10:4), they yet complained for want of water (Ex 17:2, 7). Though also eating the same spiritual meat (Christ, \"the true manna,\" \"the bread of life\"), they yet murmured, \"Our soul loatheth this light bread.\" In this case, being punished by the fiery serpents, they were saved by the brazen serpent, the emblem of Christ (compare Joh 8:56; Heb 11:26). The Greek for \"tempt\" means, tempt or try, so as to wear out the long-suffering of Christ (compare Ps 95:8, 9; Nu 14:22). The Corinthians were in danger of provoking God's long-suffering by walking on the verge of idolatry, through overweening confidence in their knowledge.",
