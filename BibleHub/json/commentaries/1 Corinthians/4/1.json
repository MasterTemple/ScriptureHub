It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves.

The chazan, or \"overseer,\" in the synagogue answered to the bishop or \"angel\" of the Church, who called seven of the synagogue to read the law every sabbath, and oversaw them. The parnasin of the synagogue, like the ancient \"deacon\" of the Church, took care of the poor (Ac 6:1-7) and subsequently preached in subordination to the presbyters or bishops, as Stephen and Philip did. The Church is not the appendage to the priesthood; but the minister is the steward of God to the Church. Man shrinks from too close contact with God; hence he willingly puts a priesthood between, and would serve God by deputy. The pagan (like the modern Romish) priest was rather to conceal than to explain \"the mysteries of God.\" The minister's office is to \"preach\" (literally, \"proclaim as a herald,\" Mt 10:27) the deep truths of God (\"mysteries,\" heavenly truths, only known by revelation), so far as they have been revealed, and so far as his hearers are disposed to receive them. Josephus says that the Jewish religion made known to all the people the mysteries of their religion, while the pagans concealed from all but the \"initiated\" few, the mysteries of theirs.1 Corinthians 4:1-5 Paul showeth in what account such as he should beheld, of whose fidelity it should be left to Godto judge.1 Corinthians 4:6,7 He dissuadeth the Corinthians from valuingthemselves in one teacher above another,since all had their respective distinctionsfrom God.1 Corinthians 4:8-13 To their self-sufficient vanity he opposeth hisown despised and afflicted state,1 Corinthians 4:14-16 warning them, as their only father in Christ, andurging theme to follow him.1 Corinthians 4:17-21 For the same cause he sent Timotheus, and meantsoon to follow in person, when he would inquireinto the authority of such as opposed him. The apostle here gives us the right notion of the preachers of the gospel; they are but ministers,  that is, servants, so as the honour that is proper to their Master, for a principal efficiency in the conversion and building up of souls, belongeth not to them; they are ministers of Christ,  so have their primary relation to him, and only a secondary relation to the church to which they are ministers; they are ministers of Christ and so in that ministration can only execute what are originally his commands, though those commands of Christ may also be enforced by men: ministers of the gospel, not of the law, upon whom lies a primary obligation to preach Christ and his gospel unto people. They are also stewards of the mysteries of God,  such to whom God hath committed his word and sacraments to dispense out unto his church. The word mystery signifieth any thing that is secret, but more especially it signifieth a Divine secret, represented by signs and figures; or a religious secret, not obvious to every capacity or understanding. Thus we read of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,  Matthew 13:11; the mystery of godliness,  1 Timothy 3:16; the mystery of Christ,  Ephesians 3:4. The wisdom of God,  Colossians 2:2; the incarnation of Christ, 1 Timothy 3:16; the calling of the Gentiles, Ephesians 3:4; the resurrection from the dead,  1 Corinthians 15:21; Christ’s mystical union and communion with his church, Ephesians 5:32; the sublime counsels of God, 1 Corinthians 13:2, are all called mysteries. Ministers are the stewards of the mysterious doctrines and institutions of Christ, which we usually comprehend under the terms of the word and sacraments. ",
