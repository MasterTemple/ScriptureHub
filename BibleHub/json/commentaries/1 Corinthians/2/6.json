        "text": "perfect—Those matured in Christian experience and knowledge alone can understand the true superiority of the Christian wisdom which Paul preached. Distinguished not only from worldly and natural men, but also from babes, who though \"in Christ\" retain much that is \"carnal\" (1Co 3:1, 2), and cannot therefore understand the deeper truths of Christianity (1Co 14:20; Php 3:15; Heb 5:14). Paul does not mean by the \"mystery\" or \"hidden wisdom\" (1Co 2:7) some hidden tradition distinct from the Gospel (like the Church of Rome's disciplina arcani and doctrine of reserve), but the unfolding of the treasures of knowledge, once hidden in God's counsels, but now announced to all, which would be intelligently comprehended in proportion as the hearer's inner life became perfectly transformed into the image of Christ. Compare instances of such \"mysteries,\" that is, deeper Christian truths, not preached at Paul's first coming to Corinth, when he confined himself to the fundamental elements (1Co 2:2), but now spoken to the \"perfect\" (1Co 15:51; Ro 11:25; Eph 3:5, 6). \"Perfect\" is used not of absolute perfection, but relatively to \"babes,\" or those less ripe in Christian growth (compare Php 3:12, 15, with 1Jo 2:12-14). \"God\" (1Co 2:7) is opposed to the world, the apostles to \"the princes [great and learned men] of this world\" (1Co 2:8; compare 1Co 1:20) [Bengel].",
