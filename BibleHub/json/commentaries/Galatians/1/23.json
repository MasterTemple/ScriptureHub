It will but little avail us to have Christ revealed to us, if he is not also revealed in us. He instantly prepared to obey, without hesitating as to his worldly interest, credit, ease, or life itself. And what matter of thanksgiving and joy is it to the churches of Christ, when they hear of such instances to the praise of the glory of his grace, whether they have ever seen them or not! They glorify God for his power and mercy in saving such persons, and for all the service to his people and cause that is done, and may be further expected from them.",

We have here the early beginnings of that objective sense in which afterwards the word got to be so commonly used in the Church to denote the Christian doctrine (see Bishop Lightfoot's essay 'Galatians,' pp. 154-158). In the second clause, \"which he was sometime  making havoc of,\" the \"faith\" is identified with the Church which held it (comp. ver. 13). We may heartily accept Estius's comment, cited by Meyer, \"Quia Christi fidelibus fidem extorquere nitebatur,\" while we still think it intolerably harsh to understand \"faith,\" as Meyer does, in a subjective sense.
