Luther follows the lxx and Vulgate, and renders this clause, \"iron and brass be upon his shoes;\" but this is undoubtedly wrong, as the custom of fastening the shoes or sandals with brass or iron was quite unknown to the Israelites; and even Goliath, who was clothed in brass from head to foot, and wore iron greaves, had no iron sandals, though the military shoes of the ancient Romans had nails in the soles. Moreover, the context contains no reference to war, so as to suggest the idea that the treading down and cursing of the foe are intended. \"As thy days,\" i.e., as long as the days of thy life last, let thy rest be (continue). Luther's rendering, \"let thine old age be as thy youth,\" which follows the Vulgate, cannot be sustained; for although דּבא, derived from דאב, to vanish away, certainly might signify old age, the expression \"thy days\" cannot possibly be understood as signifying youth.
