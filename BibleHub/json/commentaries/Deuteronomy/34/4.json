Some modern travellers have fixed on Jebel Attarus, a high mountain south of the Jabbok (Zurka), as the Nebo of this passage [Burckhardt, Seetzen, &c.].

Immediately below him was \"the circle\" of the plain of Jericho, with its oasis of palm trees; and far away on his left, the last inhabited spot before the great desert \"Zoar.\" The foreground of the picture alone was clearly discernible. There was no miraculous power of vision imparted to Moses. That he should see all that is described is what any man could do, if he attained sufficient elevation. The atmosphere of the climate is so subtle and free from vapor that the sight is carried to a distance of which the beholder, who judges from the more dense air of Europe, can form no idea [Vere Monro]. But between him and that \"good land,\" the deep valley of the Jordan intervened; \"he was not to go over thither.\"",
