As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.",

Such complaining God never hears. \"And ye sat (remained) in Kadesh many days, that ye remained,\" i.e., not \"as many days as ye had been there already before the return of the spies,\" or \"as long as ye remained in all the other stations together, viz., the half of thirty-eight years\" (as Seder Olam and many of the Rabbins interpret); but \"just as long as ye did remain there,\" as we may see from a comparison of ",
