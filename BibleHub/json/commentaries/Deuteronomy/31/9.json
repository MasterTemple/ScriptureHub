The explanation which J. H. Mich. gives is perfectly correct, \"He gave it for them to teach and keep.\" The law-book would only have been given to the priests, if the object had been simply that it should be placed by the ark of the covenant, or at the most, in the presence of the elders, but certainly not to all the elders, since they were not allowed to touch the ark.
