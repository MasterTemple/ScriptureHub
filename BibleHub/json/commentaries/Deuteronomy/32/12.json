And by the preached gospel, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, He stirs up and prevails upon sinners to leave Satan's bondage. In ver. 13,14, are emblems of the conquest believers have over their spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, and the world, in and through Christ. Also of their safety and triumph in him; of their happy frames of soul, when they are above the world, and the things of it. This will be the blessed case of spiritual Israel in every sense in the latter day.",

If no other god stood by the Lord to help Him, He had thereby laid Israel under the obligation to serve Him alone as its God. \"With Him\" refers to Jehovah, and not to Israel.",
