He that loves dearly to be employed in the service of the sanctuary, in God’s name let him minister.

Though he might have private property, that was to form no ground for withholding or even diminishing his claim to maintenance like the other ministering priests. The reason or principle of the enactment is obvious (1Co 9:13). At the same time, while every facility was afforded for the admission of such a zealous and self-denying officer, this admission was to be in an orderly manner: he was to minister \"as all his brethren\"—that is, a Gershonite with Gershonites; a Merarite with Merarites; so that there might be no derangement of the established courses.",
