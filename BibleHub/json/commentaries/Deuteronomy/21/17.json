If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated—In the original and all other translations, the words are rendered \"have had,\" referring to events that have already taken place; and that the \"had\" has, by some mistake, been omitted in our version, seems highly probable from the other verbs being in the past tense—\"hers that was hated,\" not \"hers that is hated\"; evidently intimating that she (the first wife) was dead at the time referred to. Moses, therefore, does not here legislate upon the case of a man who has two wives at the same time, but on that of a man who has married twice in succession, the second wife after the decease of the first; and there was an obvious necessity for legislation in these circumstances; for the first wife, who was hated, was dead, and the second wife, the favorite, was alive; and with the feelings of a stepmother, she would urge her husband to make her own son the heir. This case has no bearing upon polygamy, which there is no evidence that the Mosaic code legalized.",
