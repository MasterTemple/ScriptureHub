The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19]. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah [1Ki 22:40].   ",

His enemies were dismayed by his greatness, for he had famous commanders and mighty armies. He made the improper alliance with Ahab (2 Chronicles 18) but after Ahab’s death, he returned to Jerusalem and appointed and instructed judges and priests and Levites (2 Chronicles 19) to act in the fear of the Lord and with a perfect heart. He was attacked by Moab (2 Chronicles 20) but seeking unto the Lord he gained a great victory, which he celebrated in such way that the place of the celebration was known afterwards as ‘The valley of blessing.’",
