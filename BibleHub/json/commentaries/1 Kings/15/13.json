There seems little doubt that some obscene emblem is meant, of the kind so often connected with worship of the productive powers of nature in ancient religions, substituted as a still greater abomination for the ordinary asherah. Clearly the act of Maachah was one of so flagrant a kind, that Asa took the unusual step, on which the historian here lays great stress, of degrading her in her old age from her high dignity, besides hewing down her idol, and burning it publicly under the walls of Jerusalem.",

Her he removed from being queen — He took from her either the name and authority of queen regent, which she, having been Rehoboam’s wife, and Abijam’s mother, took to herself during Asa’s minority, or the dignity of the queen-mother, and those guards, or instruments of power, which she had enjoyed and misemployed. She had made an idol — Hebrew, a terror, or horror, that is, a horrible idol; which, it may be, is so called, because it was of a more terrible shape than ordinary, and not to be seen without horror. Kidron — That when it was burned to powder, it might be thrown into the water, and be unfit for any use.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary15:9-24 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.Barnes' Notes on the BibleAsa degraded Maachah from the rank and state of queen-mother.The word translated \"idol\" both here and in the parallel passage (marginal reference), does not occur elsewhere in Scripture. It is derived from a root signifying \"fear\" or \"trembling,\" and may perhaps best be understood as \"a fright, a horror.\" Such a name would seem best to apply to a grotesque and hideous image like the Phthah of the Egyptians. She made it to serve in lieu of the ordinary \"grove\" - asherah, or idolatrous emblem of Astarte (Exodus 34:13 note). Asa cut it down, for like the usual \"asherah,\" Maachah's \"horror\" was fixed in the ground.And burnt it at the brook Kidron - Similarly Josiah, when he removed Manasseh's \"grove\" - asherah - from the house of the Lord, brought it out to the brook Kidron, and burned it there. The object probably was to prevent the pollution of the holy city by even the ashes from the burning. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary13. also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen—The sultana, or queen dowager, was not necessarily the king's natural mother (see 1Ki 2:19), nor was Maachah. Her title, and the privileges connected with that honor and dignity which gave her precedency among the ladies of the royal family, and great influence in the kingdom, were taken away. She was degraded for her idolatry.because she had made an idol in a grove—A very obscene figure, and the grove was devoted to the grossest licentiousness. His plans of religious reformation, however, were not completely carried through, \"the high places were not removed\" (see 1Ki 3:2). The suppression of this private worship on natural or artificial hills, though a forbidden service after the temple had been declared the exclusive place of worship, the most pious king's laws were not able to accomplish.Matthew Poole's Commentary Her he removed from being queen,  i.e. he took from her either the name and authority of queen-regent, which she, having been Rehoboam’s wife, and Abijam’s mother, took to herself during Asa’s minority, and abused to the patronage of idolatry; or the dignity of the queen-mother, and those guards, or other ensigns of honour, or instruments of power, which, as such, she had enjoyed and misemployed. Otherwise, he removed her from the queen,  i.e. from his wife, that she might not be infected by her, and afterwards infect his children; which was a prudent and necessary care, for the prevention of so great and public a mischief. An idol,  Heb. a terror, or horror, i.e. a horrible idol; which it may be so called, either because all idols, though for a season they please, yet in the end will bring dreadful effects upon their worshippers; or because this was an idol of a more horrible or terrible shape, more abominable than ordinary, and not to be seen without horror; whether it was that filthy idol, called Priapus, which was commonly placed in groves or gardens; or Pan, or some other heathen god, to whose service she in a special manner devoted herself. Burnt it by the brook Kidron;  that when it was burnt to powder, it might be thrown into the water, and be unfit for any use. See  Exodus 32:20 Deu 12:3. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen,.... From the kingdom, as the Targum; from having any share in the government, as she might have had during his minority, his mother being dead, as some conjecture; and not only took away her power and authority, but all the ensigns of it, and perhaps forbid her the court: or he removed her from the queen, his own wife, that she might not be corrupted by her; or rather it was from presiding over the rites of the idol next mentioned, and the worshipping of it: because she had made an idol in a grove; which had its name from horror and trembling; either because it was of a terrible aspect, or injected horror into its worshippers, or brought terrible calamities and judgments upon them: according to some Jewish writers (r), it was a Priapus, of an obscene figure; and so others (s), who suppose she presided over the sacred rites of this impure deity, the same with Baalpeor; and the Heathens used to place Priapus in their gardens (t), to fright away birds; see Gill on Jeremiah 49:16, others take it to be Pan, from whence the word \"Panic\", used for any great fright: and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron: and cast the ashes of it into it, that none might have any profit by it, the gold and silver on it, and in indignation to it, see Exodus 32:20.
