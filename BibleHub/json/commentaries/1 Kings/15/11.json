Of all this the text here gives but brief notice: the record in the Chronicles (2 Chronicles 14, 15) contains a detailed account. From the same record we find that he fortified his cities and strengthened his army, and that he was able to repel with great slaughter a formidable invasion from Egypt, under “Zerah the Ethiopian,” in his fifteenth year.",
