The guilt may be taken away, but not the reproach; that will remain. Thus it must remain uncertain to us till the day of judgment, whether or not Solomon was left to suffer the everlasting displeasure of an offended God.",

The divine sentence was announced to him probably by Ahijah; but there was mercy mingled with judgment, in the circumstance, that it should not be inflicted on Solomon personally—and that a remnant of the kingdom should be spared—\"for David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, which had been chosen\" to put God's name there; not from a partial bias in favor of either, but that the divine promise might stand (2Sa 7:12-16).",
