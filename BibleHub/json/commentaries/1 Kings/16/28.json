And this reign is recorded at unusual length; in fact, it occupies nearly all the remaining portion of this volume, whereas the reigns of preceding kings have in several instances been dismissed in a few verses. It owes this distinction to the ministry of the great prophet Elijah by which it was marked, and, indeed, was profoundly influenced; but this ministry, it must be remembered, was necessitated by the critical circumstances of the time. It may be that \"every age thinks itself a crisis,\" but no one can fail to see that this was one of the veritable turning points of Jewish history. One of the real \"decisive battles of the world\" - that between the Lord and Baal - was then fought out. No wonder that our historian felt constrained to chronicle at length the transactions of a reign so pregnant both with good and evil for the people of the Lord and for the faith with which they had been put in trust. Indeed, the same guiding principle which led him to devote so many of his pages to the reign of Solomon, when the theocratic kingdom was at its highest, impelled him to linger over the reign of Ahab when religion was at its lowest ebb. The secular historian, too often like the sundial which \"counts no hours save those serene,\" draws a veil over the time of his country's decadence, or touches its misfortunes with a  light hand. It is only in the inspired records that we have an impartial register both of the glory and shame of a common. wealth. 1 Kings 16:28",
