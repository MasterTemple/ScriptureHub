On the other hand, Zimri—noted emphatically as “his servant”—was apparently the high officer left in special charge of the palace and the king’s person, while the mass of the army was in the field.

God calls Israel his people still, though wretchedly corrupted. Jehu foretells the same destruction to come upon Baasha's family, which that king had been employed to bring upon the family of Jeroboam. Those who resemble others in their sins, may expect to resemble them in the plagues they suffer, especially those who seem zealous against such sins in others as they allow in themselves. Baasha himself dies in peace, and is buried with honour. Herein plainly appears that there are punishments after death, which are most to be dreaded. Let Elah be a warning to drunkards, who know not but death may surprise them. Death easily comes upon men when they are drunk. Besides the diseases which men bring themselves into by drinking, when in that state, men are easily overcome by an enemy, and liable to bad accidents. Death comes terribly upon men in such a state, finding them in the act of sin, and unfitted for any act of devotion; that day comes upon them unawares. The word of God was fulfilled, and the sins of Baasha and Elah were reckoned for, with which they provoked God. Their idols are called their vanities, for idols cannot profit nor help; miserable are those whose gods are vanities.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe conspiracy of Zimri - Elah's \"servant\" (i. e., \"subject\") - was favored by his position, which probably gave him military authority in the city, by the absence of a great part of the people and of the officers who might have checked him, at Gibbethon 1 Kings 16:15, and by the despicable character of Elah, who, instead of going up to the war, was continually reminding men of his low origin by conduct unworthy of royalty.Steward - The office was evidently one of considerable importance. In Solomon's court it gave the rank of שׂר  śar, prince. In Persia the \"steward of the household\" acted sometimes as a sort of regent during the king's absence. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary1Ki 16:9-22. Zimri's Conspiracy.9-12. Zimri … conspired against him—\"Arza which was over his house.\" During a carousal in the house of his chamberlain, Zimri slew him, and having seized the sovereignty, endeavored to consolidate his throne by the massacre of all the royal race.Matthew Poole's Commentary Captain of half his chariots,  i.e. of all his military chariots, and the men belonging to them; the chariots for carriage of necessary things being put into other and meaner hands. As he was in Tirzah;  whilst his forces were elsewhere employed,  1 Kings 16:15, which gave Zimri advantage to execute his design. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots,.... His military chariots; there were two captains of them, and this was one of them; so the Targum, \"one of the two masters or captains of the chariots:'' conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, steward of his house in Tirzah; who had the charge of his wine and other liquors, to which he was addicted beyond measure; and this was a fit opportunity for Zimri to fall upon him, and slay him, when he was drunk, and off his guard, and his army at the same time was besieging Gibbethon, 1 Kings 16:15 so that there was a very great likeness in what befell the family of Baasha, to that of the family of Jeroboam; for as the son of the one, and of the other, reigned but two years, so they were both slain by their servants, and both at a time when Gibbethon was besieged; the Targum takes this Arza to be the temple of an idol so called, near the royal palace. Geneva Study BibleAnd his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, {e} drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.(e) The Chaldee text has this, Drinking till he was drunk in the temple of Arza the idol by his house in Tirzah.",
