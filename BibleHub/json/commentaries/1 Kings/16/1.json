        "text": "Benson Commentary1 Kings 16:1. The word of the Lord came to Jehu — This Jehu was a prophet, and the son of a prophet. His father Hanani, who was a prophet before him, was sent to reprove Asa king of Judah for hiring Benhadad king of Syria to assist him against Baasha and for relying on the Syrians, instead of relying on the Lord, 2 Chronicles 16:7. But Jehu, Hanani’s son, who was young and more active, was sent on this longer and more dangerous expedition to Baasha, king of Israel. It appears, he continued long in his usefulness; for we find him reproving Jehoshaphat, above forty years after, and writing the annals of that prince, 2 Chronicles 19:2; 2 Chronicles 20:24. The gift of prophecy, thus happily entailed, and descending from the father to the son, was worthy of so much the more honour. It seems there was not wanting a succession of prophets, during the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, as Abarbinel has observed, their names being preserved in the Holy Scriptures.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary16:1-14 This chapter relates wholly to the kingdom of Israel, and the revolutions of that kingdom. God calls Israel his people still, though wretchedly corrupted. Jehu foretells the same destruction to come upon Baasha's family, which that king had been employed to bring upon the family of Jeroboam. Those who resemble others in their sins, may expect to resemble them in the plagues they suffer, especially those who seem zealous against such sins in others as they allow in themselves. Baasha himself dies in peace, and is buried with honour. Herein plainly appears that there are punishments after death, which are most to be dreaded. Let Elah be a warning to drunkards, who know not but death may surprise them. Death easily comes upon men when they are drunk. Besides the diseases which men bring themselves into by drinking, when in that state, men are easily overcome by an enemy, and liable to bad accidents. Death comes terribly upon men in such a state, finding them in the act of sin, and unfitted for any act of devotion; that day comes upon them unawares. The word of God was fulfilled, and the sins of Baasha and Elah were reckoned for, with which they provoked God. Their idols are called their vanities, for idols cannot profit nor help; miserable are those whose gods are vanities.Barnes' Notes on the BibleHanani, the father of Jehu, was seer to Asa in the kingdom of Judah 2 Chronicles 16:7-10. His son Jehu, who here discharges the same office in the kingdom of Israel, appears at a later date as an inhabitant of Jerusalem where he prophesied under Jehoshaphat, whom he rebuked on one occasion. He must have lived to a great age, for he outlived Jehoshaphat, and wrote his life (marginal references). Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 161Ki 16:1-8. Jehu's Prophecy against Baasha.1. Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu—This is the only incident recorded in the life of this prophet. His father was also a prophet (2Ch 16:7).Jehu prophesieth against Baasha,  1 Kings 16:1-7, Elah succeedeth him: him Zimri slayeth and succeedeth: he, besieged by Omri, burneth himself,  1 Kings 16:8-20. Omri prevaileth against Tibni, and is king; buildeth Samaria; followeth the sins of Jeroboam, and dieth,  1 Kings 16:21-28. Ahab his son succeedeth him: he is more wicked than his predecessors,  1 Kings 16:29-33. Hiel buildeth Jericho; and Joshua’s curse is fulfilled in him,  1 Kings 16:34.  Jehu, a prophet, of whom see more  2 Chronicles 19:2 20:34. Hanani also was a prophet,  2 Chronicles 16:7. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleThen the word of the Lord came to Jehu the son of Hanani,.... The seer that reproved Asa, 2 Chronicles 16:7, so that this man was the son of a prophet then living, and was a young man; for we hear of him several years after reproving Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles 19:2, and as a writer of history, 2 Chronicles 20:34, the prophecy that came to him from the Lord was against Baasha; king of Israel: saying; as follows.
