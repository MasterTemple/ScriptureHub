It is a very deep well, measuring one hundred twenty-five feet in depth; the water is sweet, but not very cold, and it is at times quite full to overflowing. The Orientals are fond of enjoying festive repasts in the open air at places which command the advantage of shade, water, and verdure; and those fetes champetres are not cold collations, but magnificent entertainments, the animals being killed and dressed on the spot. Adonijah's feast at En-rogel was one of this Oriental description, and it was on a large scale (2Sa 3:4, 5; 5:14-16; 1Ch 14:1-7). At the accession of a new king there were sacrifices offered (1Sa 11:15). But on such an occasion it was no less customary to entertain the grandees of the kingdom and even the populace in a public manner (1Ch 12:23-40). There is the strongest probability that Adonijah's feast was purely political, to court popularity and secure a party to support his claim to the crown.",

Schultz (Jerusalem, eine Vorlesung, p. 79) supposes the stone or rock of Zocheleth to be \"the steep, rocky corner of the southern slope of the valley of Hinnom, which casts so deep a shade.\" \"The neighbourhood (Wady el Rubb) is still a place of recreation for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\" To this festal meal Adonijah invited all his brethren except Solomon, and \"all the men of Judah, the king's servants,\" i.e., all the Judaeans who were in the king's service, i.e., were serving at court as being members of his own tribe, with the exception of Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, and the Gibborim.
