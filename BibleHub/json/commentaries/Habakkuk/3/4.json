God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension!

So it may be a mingled image of the Glory and might; Light, which was also might. But \"horns,\" though they may be a symbol of \"light,\" are not of \"lightning;\" and the Hand of God is used as an emblem of His power, His protection, His bounty, His constraining force on His prophets. It is nowhere used of the side or sides. We have two images combined here; \"horns\" which in every other place in which they are used as a metaphor, is an emblem of power; and \"from the hand of\" which, wherever it is used of a person, means that the thing spoken of had been in his hand or power really or virtually. Both then combine in the meaning that the might came forth from the directing agency of God who wielded it.",

Or, on Mount Sinai [Drusius]. (Compare Ex 24:17). The Septuagint and Syriac versions read for \"there,\" He made a hiding, &c.; He hid Himself with clouds. English Version is better, which Calvin explains, there is said to be \"a hiding of God's power,\" because God did not reveal it indiscriminately to all, but specially to His people (Ps 31:20). The contrast seems to me to be between the \"horns\" or emanations out of His power (\"hand\"), and that \"power\" itself. The latter was hidden, whereas the \"horns\" or emanations alone were manifested. If the mere scintillations were so awfully overwhelming, how much more so the hidden power itself! This was especially true of His manifestation at Sinai (Ps 18:11; compare Isa 45:15, 17).",
