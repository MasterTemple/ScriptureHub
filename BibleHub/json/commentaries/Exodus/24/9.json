Nothing is said as to the form in which God manifested Himself. This silence, however, is not intended \"to indicate the imperfection of their sight of God,\" as Baumgarten affirms, nor is it to be explained, as Hoffmann supposes, on the ground that \"what they saw differed from what the people had constantly before their eyes simply in this respect, that after they had entered the darkness, which enveloped the mountain that burned as it were with fire at its summit, the fiery sign separated from the cloud, and assumed a shape, beneath which it was bright and clear, as an image of untroubled bliss.\" The words are evidently intended to affirm something more than, that they saw the fiery form in which God manifested Himself to the people, and that whilst the fire was ordinarily enveloped in a cloud, they saw it upon the mountain without the cloud.
