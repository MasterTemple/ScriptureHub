The first tables of the covenant were called \"tables of stone\" (Exodus 24:12; Exodus 31:18); the second, on the other hand, which were hewn by Moses, are called \"tables of stones\" (Exodus 34:1 and Exodus 34:4); and the latter expression is applied indiscriminately to both of them in Deuteronomy 4:13; Deuteronomy 5:19; Deuteronomy 9:9-11; Deuteronomy 10:1-4.
