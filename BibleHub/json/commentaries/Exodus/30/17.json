They must not only wash and be made clean, when first made priests, but must wash and be kept clean, whenever they went to minister.

This was not a voluntary contribution, but a ransom for the soul or lives of the people. It was required from all classes alike, and a refusal to pay implied a wilful exclusion from the privileges of the sanctuary, as well as exposure to divine judgments.
