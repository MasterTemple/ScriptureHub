It is the glory of a holy God, that he dwelleth between the cherubim, that is, he is continually attended by the blessed angels, whose swiftness was signified by the wings of the cherubim, and their unanimity in their services, by their faces being one toward another. It is the character of an upright heart, that, like the ark of the testimony, it hath the law of God hid and kept in it. By Jesus Christ, the great propitiation, there is reconciliation made, and a communion settled between us and God: he interposeth between us and God’s displeasure; and through him we become entitled to God’s favour.",
