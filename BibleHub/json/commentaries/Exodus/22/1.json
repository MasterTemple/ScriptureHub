Four sheep for a sheep. Quest. 1. Why so much, seeing the stealer of other things was tied to restore but double? Answ. 1. For terror, because these beasts being kept in the fields might more easily be stolen. 2. Because the loss of these was greater than of other things; for they did not only lose what the cattle might be sold for, but all the service, increase, and other benefits which a man might receive from them. Quest. 2. Why more for oxen than for sheep? Answ. 1. Because it argued greater boldness and customariness in the thief to steal that which might more easily be discovered. 2. Because besides the intrinsical worth of the ox, the labour of the ox was very considerable to his owner,  Proverbs 14:4, and therefore the loss greater. ",

The difference between the compensation for an ox and a small animal is to be accounted for from the comparative worth of the cattle to the possessor, which determined the magnitude of the theft and the amount of the compensation. But the other distinctions of twofold, fourfold, and fivefold restitution cannot be accounted for, either by supposing \"that the animal slain or sold was lost to its master, and might have been of peculiar value to him\" (Knobel), for such a consideration of personal feelings would have been quite foreign to the law-not to mention the fact that an animal that had been sold might be recovered by purchase; or from the fact that \"the thief in this case had carried his crime still further\" (Baumgarten), for the main thing was still the theft, not the consumption or sale of the animal stolen. The reason can only have lain in the educational purpose of the law: viz., in the intention to lead the thief to repent of his crime, to acknowledge his guilt, and to restore what he had stolen. Now, as long as he still retained the stolen animal in his own possession, having neither consumed nor parted with it, this was always in his power; but the possibility was gone as soon as it had either been consumed or sold (see by Archologie, 154, Note 3).",
