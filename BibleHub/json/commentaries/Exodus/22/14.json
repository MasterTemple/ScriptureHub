Consequently, if the thing lent were lost or injured, however the loss was brought about, the borrower was justly called upon to make it good. The only exception was, when the lender was still in charge of what he lent, present with it, and able to keep guard over it.",

This difference causes a difference of obligation. The borrower, having borrowed solely for his own advantage, must take all the risks, and in any case return the thing borrowed, or its value, unless the owner was still, in some sort, in charge of his own property.  Things hired are not, however, to be regarded as borrowed. If harm come to them, the owner must suffer the loss. ",

The words which follow, וגו שׂכיר אם, cannot have any other meaning than this, \"if it was hired, it has come upon his hire,\" i.e., he has to bear the injury or loss for the money which he got for letting out the animal. The suggestion which Knobel makes with a \"perhaps,\" that שׂכיר refers to a hired labourer, to whom the word is applied in other places, and that the meaning is this, \"if it is a labourer for hire, he goes into his hire, - i.e., if the hirer is a daily labourer who has nothing with which to make compensation, he is to enter into the service of the person who let him the animal, for a sufficiently long time to make up for the loss,\" - is not only opposed to the grammar (the perfect בּא for which יבא should be used), but is also at variance with the context, \"not make it good.\" ",
