Lyra has given the following correct rendering of this heading: \"haec est summa numeri ponderis eorum, quae facta sunt in tabernaculo ex auro, argento et aere.\" It was apparently superfluous to enumerate the different articles again, as this had been repeatedly done before. The weight of the different metals, therefore, is all that is given. The \"dwelling\" is still further described as \"the dwelling of the testimony,\" because the testimony, i.e., the decalogue written with the finger of God upon the tables of stone, was kept in the dwelling, and this testimony formed the base of the throne of Jehovah, and was the material pledge that Jehovah would cause His name, His manifested presence, to dwell there, and would thus show Himself to His people in grace and righteousness. \"That which was numbered\" is an explanatory apposition to the previous clause, \"the numbering of the dwelling;\" and the words הלויּם עבדת, which follow, are an accusative construed freely to indicate more particularly the mode of numbering (Ewald, 204 a), viz., \"through the service,\" or \"by means of the service of the Levites,\" not for their service. \"By the hand of Ithamar:\" who presided over the calculations which the Levites carried out under his superintendence.",
