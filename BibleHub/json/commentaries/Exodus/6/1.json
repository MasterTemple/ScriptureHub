He will then cease to doubt.With a strong hand shall he let them go.—Rather, through a strong hand: i.e., through the compulsion which my strong hand will exert on him,Drive them.—Comp. Exodus 12:31-33.Benson CommentaryExodus 6:1. Now shalt thou see what I will do — Here we have a striking proof of God’s long-suffering. Instead of severely reproving Moses for his impatience, as manifested at the close of the preceding chapter, and his injurious complaints, he condescends to give him fresh assurances of his power and his determination to deliver the Israelites. With a strong hand — That is, being forced to it with a strong hand, or by those terrible judgments which I shall inflict upon him by my power, he shall let them go.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary6:1-9 We are most likely to prosper in attempts to glorify God, and to be useful to men, when we learn by experience that we can do nothing of ourselves; when our whole dependence is placed on him, and our only expectation is from him. Moses had been expecting what God would do; but now he shall see what he will do. God would now be known by his name Jehovah, that is, a God performing what he had promised, and finishing his own work. God intended their happiness: I will take you to me for a people, a peculiar people, and I will be to you a God. More than this we need not ask, we cannot have, to make us happy. He intended his own glory: Ye shall know that I am the Lord. These good words, and comfortable words, should have revived the drooping Israelites, and have made them forget their misery; but they were so taken up with their troubles, that they did not heed God's promises. By indulging discontent and fretfulness, we deprive ourselves of the comfort we might have, both from God's word and from his providence, and go comfortless.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe earnestness of this remonstrance, and even its approach to irreverence, are quite in keeping with other notices of Moses' naturally impetuous character. See Exodus 3:13. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 6Ex 6:1-13. Renewal of the Promise.1. the Lord said unto Moses—The Lord, who is long-suffering and indulgent to the errors and infirmities of His people, made allowance for the mortification of Moses as the result of this first interview and cheered him with the assurance of a speedy and successful termination to his embassy.God encourageth Moses,  Exodus 6:1; reneweth his covenant, confirms it by his name Jehovah,  Exodus 6:3-8. Their unbelief,  Exodus 6:9. God commands Moses to speak to Pharaoh to let Israel go,  Exodus 6:10-13.

Moses and Aaron spake to Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go, Exodus 6:27 With a strong hand;  being compelled to do so by my powerful and terrible works. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleThen the Lord said unto Moses,.... In answer to the questions put to him, and the expostulations made with him: now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: in inflicting punishments on him: for with a strong hand shall he let them go; being forced to it by the mighty hand of God upon him; and it is by some rendered, \"because of a strong hand\" (s); so Jarchi; for this is not to be understood of the hand of Pharaoh, but of the hand of God: and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land: not only be willing that they should go, but be urgent upon them to be gone, Exodus 12:33.
