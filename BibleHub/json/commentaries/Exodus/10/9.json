This should be much worse than any of that kind which had ever been known. Pharaoh's attendants persuade him to come to terms with Moses. Hereupon Pharaoh will allow the men to go, falsely pretending that this was all they desired. He swears that they shall not remove their little ones. Satan does all he can to hinder those that serve God themselves, from bringing their children to serve him. He is a sworn enemy to early piety. Whatever would put us from engaging our children in God's service, we have reason to suspect Satan in it. Nor should the young forget that the Lord's counsel is, Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; but Satan's counsel is, to keep children in a state of slavery to sin and to the world. Mark that the great foe of man wishes to retain him by the ties of affection, as Pharaoh would have taken hostages from the Israelites for their return, by holding their wives and children in captivity. Satan is willing to share our duty and our service with the Saviour, because the Saviour will not accept those terms.",

Moses required the whole nation to depart, without regard to age or sex, along with all their flocks and herds. He mentioned \"young and old, sons and daughters;\" the wives as belonging to the men being included in the \"we.\" Although he assigned a reason for this demand, viz., that they were to hold a feast to Jehovah, Pharaoh was so indignant, that he answered scornfully at first: \"Be it so; Jehovah be with you when I let you and your little ones go;\" i.e., may Jehovah help you in the same way in which I let you and your little ones go. This indicated contempt not only for Moses and Aaron, but also for Jehovah, who had nevertheless proved Himself, by His manifestations of mighty power, to be a God who would not suffer Himself to be trifled with. After this utterance of his ill-will, Pharaoh told the messengers of God that he could see through their intention. \"Evil is before your face;\" i.e., you have evil in view. He called their purpose an evil one, because they wanted to withdraw the people from his service. \"Not so,\" i.e., let it not be as you desire. \"Go then, you men, and serve Jehovah.\" But even this concession was not seriously meant. This is evident from the expression, \"Go then,\" in which the irony is unmistakeable; and still more so from the fact, that with these words he broke off all negotiation with Moses and Aaron, and drove them from his presence. ויגרשׁ: \"one drove them forth;\" the subject is not expressed, because it is clear enough that the royal servants who were present were the persons who drove them away. \"For this are ye seeking:\" אתהּ relates simply to the words \"serve Jehovah,\" by which the king understood the sacrificial festival, for which in his opinion only the men could be wanted; not that \"he supposed the people for whom Moses had asked permission to go, to mean only the men\" (Knobel). The restriction of the permission to depart to the men alone was pure caprice; for even the Egyptians, according to Herodotus (2, 60), held religious festivals at which the women were in the habit of accompanying the men.
