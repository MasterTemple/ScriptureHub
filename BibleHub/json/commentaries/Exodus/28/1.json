It comprises drawers (ver. 42), tunics, girdles, and caps or turbans (ver. 40).

These clothes were to be used \"to sanctify him (Aaron and his sons), that he might be a priest to Jehovah.\" Sanctification, as the indispensable condition of priestly service, was not merely the removal of the uncleanness which flowed from sin, but, as it were, the transformation of the natural into the glory of the image of God.
