Among existent polytheisms, hers was the most famous; and her gods must have seemed, not only to herself, but to all the surrounding nations, the most powerful. To discredit them was to throw discredit upon polytheism generally, and to exalt the name of Jehovah above that of all the deities of the nations. (Comp. ",

Pharaoh, proud and great as he was, could not resist. Moses stood not in awe of Pharaoh, but made him tremble. This seems to be meant in the words, Thou shalt be a god unto Pharaoh. At length Moses is delivered from his fears. He makes no more objections, but, being strengthened in faith, goes about his work with courage, and proceeds in it with perseverance.",
