She informs her husband hereof: he prayeth, and obtaineth a return of the angel,  Judges 13:6-14. Manoah is desirous to provide food for the angel, and inquireth after his name,  Judges 13:15-18. He sacrificeth to the Lord, and the angel ascendeth to heaven in the flame of the burnt-offering,  Judges 13:19-21.

And it is probably conceived, that that great slaughter of the Ephraimites made by Jephthah did greatly encourage the Philistines to rise against Israel, when one of their chief bulwarks was so much weakened; and therefore that the Philistines began to domineer over them not long after Jephthah’s death.
