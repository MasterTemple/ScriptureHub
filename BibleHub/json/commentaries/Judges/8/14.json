The Chaldee, which has been followed by the Rabbins and Luther, has rendered it \"before sunset,\" in utter opposition to the rules of the language; for although cheres is a word used poetically to denote the sun, מעלה cannot mean the setting of the sun. Aquila and Symmachus, on the other hand, confound חרס with הרים. - Gideon laid hold of a young man of the people of Succoth, and got him to write down for him the princes and elders (magistrates and rulers) of the city, - in all seventy-seven men. ויּכתּב ויּשׁאלהוּ is a short expression for \"he asked him the names of the princes and elders of the city, and the boy wrote them down.\" אליו, lit. to him, i.e., for him.",
