The love of money made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and made her so unkind to her son, as to curse him. Outward losses drive good people to their prayers, but bad people to their curses. This woman's silver was her god, before it was made into a graven or a molten image.

Bible), had stolen 1100 shekels of silver (about 135) from his mother. This is very apparent from the words which he spoke to his mother (v. 2): \"The thousand and hundred shekels of silver which were taken from thee (the singular לקּח refers to the silver), about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears (i.e., didst so utter the curse that among others I also heard it), behold, this silver is with me; I have taken it.\" אלה, to swear, used to denote a malediction or curse (cf. אלה קול, ",

But his mother praised him for it, - \"Blessed be my son of Jehovah,\" - partly because she saw in it a proof that there still existed a germ of the fear of God, but in all probability chiefly because she was about to dedicate the silver to Jehovah; for, when her son had given it back to her, she said (v. 3), \"I have sanctified the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son, to make an image and molten work.\" The perfect הקדּשׁתּי is not to be taken in the sense of the pluperfect, \"I had sanctified it,\" but is expressive of an act just performed: I have sanctified it, I declare herewith that I do sanctify it. \"And now I give it back to thee,\" namely, to appropriate to thy house of God.",
