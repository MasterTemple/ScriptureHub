The love of money made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and made her so unkind to her son, as to curse him. Outward losses drive good people to their prayers, but bad people to their curses. This woman's silver was her god, before it was made into a graven or a molten image. Micah and his mother agreed to turn their money into a god, and set up idol worship in their family. See the cause of this corruption. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes, and then they soon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.",

It relates to his foundation of a small sanctuary of his own—a miniature representation of the Shiloh tabernacle—which he stocked with images modelled probably in imitation of the ark and cherubim. Micah and his mother were sincere in their intention to honor God. But their faith was blended with a sad amount of ignorance and delusion.

But his mother praised him for it, - \"Blessed be my son of Jehovah,\" - partly because she saw in it a proof that there still existed a germ of the fear of God, but in all probability chiefly because she was about to dedicate the silver to Jehovah; for, when her son had given it back to her, she said (v. 3), \"I have sanctified the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son, to make an image and molten work.\" The perfect הקדּשׁתּי is not to be taken in the sense of the pluperfect, \"I had sanctified it,\" but is expressive of an act just performed: I have sanctified it, I declare herewith that I do sanctify it. \"And now I give it back to thee,\" namely, to appropriate to thy house of God.",
