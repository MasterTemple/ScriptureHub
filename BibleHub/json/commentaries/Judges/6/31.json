        "text": "But when they demanded of Joash, \"Bring out (give out) thy son, that he may die,\" he said to all who stood round, \"Will ye, ye, fight for Baal, or will he save him? ('ye' is repeated with special emphasis). \"whoever shall fight for him (Baal), shall be put to death till the morning.\" עד־הבּקר, till the (next) morning, is not to be joined to יוּומת, in the sense of \"very speedily, before the dawning day shall break\" (Bertheau), - a sense which is not to be found in the words: it rather belongs to the subject of the clause, or to the whole clause in the sense of, Whoever shall fight for Baal, and seek to avenge the destruction of his altar by putting the author of it to death, shall be put to death himself; let us wait till to-morrow, and give Baal time to avenge the insult which he has received. \"If he be God, let him fight for himself; for they have destroyed his altar,\" and have thereby challenged his revenge. Gideon's daring act of faith had inspired his father Joash with believing courage, so that he took the part of his son, and left the whole matter to the deity to decide. If Baal were really God, he might be expected to avenge the crime that had been committed against this altar.",
