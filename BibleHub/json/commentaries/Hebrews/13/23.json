It is good to have the law of holy love and kindness written in the hearts of Christians, one towards another. Religion teaches men true civility and good breeding.

There is no other one of the apostles who would so naturally have used this term respecting Timothy, and this kind mention is made of him here because he was so dear to the heart of the writer, and because he felt that they to whom he wrote would also feel an interest in his circumstances. As to the meaning of the word rendered \"set at liberty\" - ἀπολελυμένον  apolelumenon - there has been much difference of opinion whether it means \"set at liberty from confinement,\" or, \"sent away on some message to some other place.\" That the latter is the meaning of the expression appears probable from these considerations.",

At all events, he was at this time away, and there was some expectation that he might soon return. But on the supposition that the expression relates to release from imprisonment, there would be an entire incongruity in the language. It is not, as we should then suppose, \"our brother Timothy is now released from prison, and therefore I will come soon with him and see you;\" but, \"our brother Timothy is now sent away, and if he return soon I will come with him to you.\"",
