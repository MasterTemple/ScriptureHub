Further, the purpose of his death is said to be \"for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant.\" For in the passage of Jeremiah the defect of the first covenant was based on the transgression of its conditions by man, while under the new one, such transgressions were to be no more remembered. But this could not be without atonement for them; the whole ceremonial of the Law signified this; and also that such atonement could not be except by death. The death of Christ satisfied this requirement; and so the new covenant could come in. So far the course of thought is clear. Nor is there difficulty in understanding the purport of ver. 18, etc., taken by itself, where the \"blood-shedding\" that inaugurated the first covenant is regarded as typical of that of Christ in the inauguration of the new one.
