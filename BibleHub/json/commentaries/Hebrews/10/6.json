But when God manifested in the flesh, became the sacrifice, and his death upon the accursed tree the ransom, then the Sufferer being of infinite worth, his free-will sufferings were of infinite value. The atoning sacrifice must be one capable of consenting, and must of his own will place himself in the sinner's stead: Christ did so. The fountain of all that Christ has done for his people, is the sovereign will and grace of God. The righteousness brought in, and the sacrifice once offered by Christ, are of eternal power, and his salvation shall never be done away. They are of power to make all the comers thereunto perfect; they derive from the atoning blood, strength and motives for obedience, and inward comfort.",

The reading there is, \"burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required.\" The quotation by the apostle is taken from the Septuagint, with the change of a single word, which does not materially affect the sense - the word ὀυκ ἐυδόκησας  ouk eudokēsas - \"ouk eudokesas\" - \"thou hast no pleasure,\" instead of ὀυκ ἠθέλησας  ouk ēthelēsas - \"ouk ethelesas\" - \"thou dost not will.\" The idea is, that God had no pleasure in them as compared with obedience. He preferred the latter, and they could not be made to come in the place of it, or to answer the same purpose. When they were performed with a pure heart, he was doubtless pleased with the offering. As used here in reference to the Messiah, the meaning is, that they would not be what was required of \"him.\" Such offerings would not answer the end for which he was sent into the world, for that end was to be accomplished only by his being \"obedient unto death.\" ",
