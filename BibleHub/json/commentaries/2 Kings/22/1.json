Exodus 15:26; Isaiah 30:26.)Eight years old.—The queen-mother was probably paramount in the government during the first years of the reign.Boscath.—In the lowland of Judah (Joshua 15:39).He reigned thirty and one years.—And somewhat over. (Comp. Jeremiah 1:2; Jeremiah 25:1; Jeremiah 25:3; according to which passages it was twenty-three years from the thirteenth of Josiah to the fourth of Jehoiakim.)Benson Commentary2 Kings 22:1-2. Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign — Being young, he had not received any bad impressions from the example of his father and grandfather, but soon saw their errors, and God gave him grace to take warning by them. He saw his father’s sins, and considered, and did not the like, Ezekiel 18:14. He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord — See the power of divine grace! Although he was born of a wicked father, had neither had a good education given him, nor a good example set him, but many about him, who, no doubt, advised him to tread in his father’s steps, and few that gave him any good counsel; yet the grace of God makes him an eminent saint, cuts him off from the wild olive, grafts him into the good olive, and renders him fruitful to God’s glory, and the profit of myriads. He walked in a good way, and turned not aside, as some of his predecessors had done who began well, to the right hand or to the left. There are errors on both hands, but God kept him in the right way: he fell not either into superstition or profaneness.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary22:1-10 The different event of Josiah's early succession from that of Manasseh, must be ascribed to the distinguishing grace of God; yet probably the persons that trained him up were instruments in producing this difference. His character was most excellent. Had the people joined in the reformation as heartily as he persevered in it, blessed effects would have followed. But they were wicked, and had become fools in idolatry. We do not obtain full knowledge of the state of Judah from the historical records, unless we refer to the writings of the prophets who lived at the time. In repairing the temple, the book of the law was found, and brought to the king. It seems, this book of the law was lost and missing; carelessly mislaid and neglected, as some throw their Bibles into corners, or maliciously concealed by some of the idolaters. God's care of the Bible plainly shows his interest in it. Whether this was the only copy in being or not, the things contained in it were new, both to the king and to the high priest. No summaries, extracts, or collections out of the Bible, can convey and preserve the knowledge of God and his will, like the Bible itself. It was no marvel that the people were so corrupt, when the book of the law was so scarce; they that corrupted them, no doubt, used arts to get that book out of their hands. The abundance of Bibles we possess aggravates our national sins; for what greater contempt of God can we show, than to refuse to read his word when put into our hands, or, reading it, not to believe and obey it? By the holy law is the knowledge of sin, and by the blessed gospel is the knowledge of salvation. When the former is understood in its strictness and excellence, the sinner begins to inquire, What must I do to be saved? And the ministers of the gospel point out to him Jesus Christ, as the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe intention of the conspirators had perhaps been to declare a forfeiture of the crown by the existing line, and to place a new dynasty on the throne. This the people would not suffer. They arrested them and put them to death; and insisted on investing with the royal authority the true heir of David, the eldest son of Amon, though he was a boy only 8 years old. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 222Ki 22:1, 2. Josiah's Good Reign.1, 2. Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign—Happier than his grandfather Manasseh, he seems to have fallen during his minority under the care of better guardians, who trained him in the principles and practice of piety; and so strongly had his young affections been enlisted on the side of true and undefiled religion, that he continued to adhere all his life, with undeviating perseverance, to the cause of God and righteousness.Matthew Poole's Commentary2 KINGS CHAPTER 22. Josiah’s good reign; his care for the repair of the temple,  2 Kings 21:1-7. Hilkiah found a book of the law; the king by it understandeth God’s threatenings against backsliders, and by Huldah the prophetess inquireth of the Lord,  2 Kings 21:8-14. She prophesieth the destruction of Jerusalem, but not in Josiah’s time,  2 Kings 22:15-20.  No text from Poole on this verse. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleJosiah was eight years old when he began to reign,.... And must be born when his father was but sixteen, for Amon lived but twenty four years, 2 Kings 21:19, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem; and so must die at thirty nine years of age: and his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath; a city of the tribe of Judah; see Gill on Joshua 15:39. Geneva Study BibleJosiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.",
