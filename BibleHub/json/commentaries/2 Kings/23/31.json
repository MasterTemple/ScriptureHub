A little time, and slender abilities, often suffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years, been labouring to effect.

It was three months before he had completed his conquests in these quarters, and, having arranged matters to his satisfaction, set out on his return to Egypt. During these three months Jehoahaz bore rule at Jerusalem (ver. 31), and \"did evil in the sight of the Lord\" (ver. 32). Ezekiel compares him to \"a young lion,\" which \"learned to catch the prey, and devoured men\" (Ezekiel 19:3). It may be suspected that he re-established the idolatries which Josiah had put down; but this is uncertain. Pharaoh-Nechoh, on his return from Carehemish, learning what the Jews had done, sent envoys to Jerusalem, and summoned Jehoahaz to his presence at Riblah, in the territory of Hamath (ver. 33; comp. Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. § 2).
