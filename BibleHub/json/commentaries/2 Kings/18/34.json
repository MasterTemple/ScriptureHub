It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.",

Sargon mentions in his annals that he besieged and took Sepharvaim (Sippara) in his twelfth year ( B.C. 710). Have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand? There is probably some compression of the original narrative here. The meaning is, \"Have they delivered their several cities, or has the god of Samaria delivered his city out of my hand?\" No god had hitherto delivered any city which the Assyrians had attacked. 2 Kings 18:34Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old TestamentEven Jehovah could not deliver them any more than Hezekiah. As a proof of this, Rabshakeh enumerated a number of cities and lands which the king of Assyria had conquered, without their gods' being able to offer any resistance to his power. \"Where are the gods of Hamath, etc., that they might have delivered Samaria out of my hand?\" Instead of הצּילוּ כּי we have הץ וכי and that they might have, which loosens the connection somewhat more between this clause and the preceding one, and makes it more independent. \"Where are they?\" is equivalent to they are gone, have perished (cf. 2 Kings 19:18); and \"that they might have delivered\" is equivalent to they have not delivered. The subject to הצּילוּ כּי is הגּוים אלהי, which includes the God of Samaria. Sennacherib regards himself as being as it were one with his predecessors, as the representative of the might of Assyria, so that he attributes to himself the conquests of cities and lands which his ancestors had made. The cities and lands enumerated in 2 Kings 18:34 have been mentioned already in 2 Kings 17:24 as conquered territories, from which colonists had been transplanted to Samaria, with the exception of Arpad and Hena. ארפּד, which is also mentioned in 2 Kings 19:13; Isaiah 10:9; Isaiah 36:19; Isaiah 37:13, and Jeremiah 49:23, in connection with Hamath, was certainly situated in the neighbourhood of that city, and still exists, so far as the name is concerned, in the large village of rfd, Arfd (mentioned by Maraszid, i. 47), in northern Syria in the district of Azz, which was seven hours to the north of Haleb, according to Abulf. Tab. Syr. ed. Khler, p. 23, and Niebuhr, Reise, ii. p. 414 (see Roediger, Addenda ad Ges. thes. p. 112). הנע, Hena, which is also combined with 'Ivvah in 2 Kings 19:13 and Isaiah 37:13, is probably the city of 'nt Ana, on the Euphrates, mentioned by Abulf., and עוּה is most likely the same as עוּא in 2 Kings 17:24. The names ועוּה הנע are omitted from the text of Isaiah in consequence of the abridgment of Rabshakeh's address.Links2 Kings 18:34 Interlinear2 Kings 18:34 Parallel Texts2 Kings 18:34 NIV2 Kings 18:34 NLT2 Kings 18:34 ESV2 Kings 18:34 NASB2 Kings 18:34 KJV2 Kings 18:34 Bible Apps2 Kings 18:34 Parallel2 Kings 18:34 Biblia Paralela2 Kings 18:34 Chinese Bible2 Kings 18:34 French Bible2 Kings 18:34 German BibleBible Hub",
