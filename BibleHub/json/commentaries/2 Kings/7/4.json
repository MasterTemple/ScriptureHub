Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleIf we say we will enter into the city,.... Contrary to the law which forbid them: then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; not being able to obtain food to preserve life: and if we sit here, we die also; having nothing to eat to support nature: now therefore let us come, and fall unto the host of the Syrians; put ourselves into their hands, and lie at their mercy: if they save us alive, we shall live; if they do not put us to death, but give us bread to eat, our lives will be preserved: and if they kill us, we shall but die; which we must inevitably do, whether we stay here, or go into the city. Geneva Study BibleIf we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.",
