The compiler may have transferred it to its present position in order, as Thenius suggests, to indicate the lapse of some time between the events described here and there; and further, to separate the account of the renewed warfare between Syria and Israel (2Kings 6:8, seq.) from that of Elisha’s good deed to Naaman the Syrian.The place where we dwell with thee.—Rather, the place where we sit before thee: scil., habitually, for instruction.

Jericho was close to the Jordan (2Kings 6:2), but that does not prove that it is meant here. The prophet’s disciples did not live in a single building, like a community of monks.

(Comp. 2Kings 4:43.)Benson Commentary2 Kings 6:1-2. The sons of the prophet said to Elisha — Probably those that were at Gilgal, for that is the place last mentioned where the prophet was, (chap. 2 Kings 4:38,) and was also near to Jordan. Let us go — unto Jordan — To the woods near Jordan; and take thence every man a beam — A piece of timber for the building. Hence it may be gathered, that although the sons of the prophets principally devoted themselves to religious exercises, yet they sometimes employed themselves about manual arts.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary6:1-7 There is that pleasantness in the converse of servants of God, which can make those who listen to them forget the pain and the weariness of labour. Even the sons of the prophets must not be unwilling to labour. Let no man think an honest employment a burden or a disgrace. And labour of the head, is as hard, and very often harder, than labour with the hands. We ought to be careful of that which is borrowed, as of our own, because we must do as we would be done by. This man was so respecting the axe-head. And to those who have an honest mind, the sorest grievance of poverty is, not so much their own want and disgrace, as being rendered unable to pay just debts. But the Lord cares for his people in their smallest concerns. And God's grace can thus raise the stony iron heart, which is sunk into the mud of this world, and raise up affections, naturally earthly.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe writer returns here to the series of miracles which Elisha performed for the benefit of the prophetical schools under his care. The connection, in this point of view, is with 2 Kings 4:44.The place where we dwell with thee - literally, \"the place where we sit before thee,\" i. e. \"the place where we assemble and sit to bear thy teaching.\" Elisha visited the sons of the prophets in circuit, staying a short time at each place where a \"school\" was established. Perhaps he was now visiting Jericho. Compare 2 Kings 2:5. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 62Ki 6:1-7. Elisha Causes Iron to Swim.1. the place where we dwell with thee—Margin, \"sit before thee.\" The one points to a common residence—the other to a common place of meeting. The tenor of the narrative shows the humble condition of Elisha's pupils. The place was either Beth-el or Jericho, probably the latter. The ministry and miracles of Elisha brought great accessions to his schools.Elisha, giving leave to the young prophets to enlarge their dwellings, causeth iron to swim,  2 Kings 6:1-7. He discloseth the king of Syria’s counsel,  2 Kings 6:8-12; who sendeth Syrians to apprehend him: he is preserved by angels: they are smitten with blindness; are brought into Samaria, and dismissed in peace,  2 Kings 6:13-23. Samaria is besieged, and brought to such extreme want and famine, that women eat their own children,  2 Kings 6:24-29. The king sendeth to slay Elisha,  2 Kings 6:30-33.  The sons of the prophets;  either at Beth-el, or Jericho or rather, at Gilgal; as may seem from its nearness to the river of Jordan,  2 Kings 6:2. With thee,  or, before thy face, i.e. under thy inspection and direction; where thou dost frequently dwell with us. Or, to thy face; which may be joined with the following words; and so the sense may be this, It is apparent to thy view that this place is too strait for us. Is too strait for us; the number of the prophets increasing by the gracious providence of God, and by the ministry and miracles of Elijah and Elisha. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha,.... Or the disciples of the prophets, as the Targum: behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us: their numbers were so increased, that there was not room enough for them in the house they dwelt in with the prophet; which increase was owing, the Jews (z) say, to the departure of Gehazi last mentioned, who was a bad man, and used the disciples so ill, that they could not stay in the college; but, when he was gone, they flocked in great numbers; but rather it was owing to the very instructive ministry and wonderful miracles of Elisha: the place where the prophet and his disciples now dwelt seems to be Gilgal, 2 Kings 4:38. (z) T. Bab. Sanhedrin, fol. 107. 2.Geneva Study BibleAnd the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.",
