This is supported by the LXX., “ὅτι ἐκεῖ Συρία κέκρυπται;” the Syriac and Arabic, “are lurking;” the Vulg., “in insidiis sunt;” and the Targum, “are hidden.” But the word (Heb.) is really an irregular participial formation from nahath, “to descend,” and the Authorised Version is therefore correct. The versions have deduced the idea of hiding from that of going down, as if crouching on the ground were meant.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary6:8-12 The king of Israel regarded the warnings Elisha gave him, of danger from the Syrians, but would not heed the warnings of danger from his sins. Such warnings are little heeded by most; they would save themselves from death, but will not from hell. Nothing that is done, said, or thought, by any person, in any place, at any time, is out of God's knowledge.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe king of Syria - Probably the great Benhadad (see 2 Kings 6:24). Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary2Ki 6:8-17. Discloses the King of Syria's Counsel.8-12. the king of Syria warred against Israel—This seems to have been a sort of guerrilla warfare, carried on by predatory inroads on different parts of the country. Elisha apprised King Jehoram of the secret purpose of the enemy; so, by adopting precautionary measures, he was always enabled to anticipate and defeat their attacks. The frequency of his disappointments having led the Syrian king to suspect some of his servants of carrying on a treacherous correspondence with the enemy, he was informed about Elisha, whose apprehension he forthwith determined to effect. This resolution was, of course, grounded on the belief that however great the knowledge of Elisha might be, if seized and kept a prisoner, he could no longer give information to the king of Israel.Matthew Poole's Commentary No text from Poole on this verse. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd the man of God sent unto the king of Israel,.... That is, Elisha sent to him: saying: beware that thou pass not such a place: not go to it, but avoid it, and pass another way: for thither the Syrians are come down: are hidden, as the Targum; lie covered at the bottom of the hill, so as not to be seen.

Ewald, 161, a.), is quite appropriate, so that there is no need either for the alteration into תּחבאוּ, \"ye shall hide yourselves\" (Then.), or into תּנחתוּ, with the meaning which is arbitrarily postulated, \"ye shall place an ambush\" (Ewald, Gesch. iii. p. 558), or for the much simpler alteration into לי תּחנוּ, \"pitch the camp for me\" (Bttcher). The singular suffix in תּחנתי refers to the king as leader of the war: \"my camp\"  equals  the camp of my army. \"Beware of passing over (עבר) this place,\" i.e., of leaving it unoccupied, \"for there have the Syrians determined to make their invasion.\" נחתּים, from נחת, going down, with dagesh euphon., whereas Ewald (187, b.) is of opinion that נחתּים, instead of being an intrans. part.
