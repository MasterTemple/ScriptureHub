(Comp. 2 Chronicles 25)(2) Jehoaddan.—The Hebrew text, which is supported by the LXX., has Jehoaddin (perhaps, “Jehovah is delight;” comp. Isaiah 47:8, and the Divine name Naaman).Benson Commentary2 Kings 14:1-2. In the second year of Joash, king of Israel — After he began to reign alone: for he reigned two or three years with his father, of which see the note on 2 Kings 13:10. This, as Dr. Lightfoot observes, was the thirty-eighth year of his father Joash, king of Judah, three years before his death. For Joash had thrown himself into such a miserable condition by his apostacy, and the murder of Zechariah, (2 Kings 12:17; 2 Chronicles 24:25,) that he was become unfit to govern the kingdom. He reigned twenty and nine years — Fourteen of which he was contemporary with Joash, king of Israel, and fifteen with Jeroboam, the son of Joash, 2 Kings 14:17.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary14:1-7 Amaziah began well, but did not go on so. It is not enough to do that which our pious predecessors did, merely to keep up the common usage, but we must do it as they did, from the same principle of faith and devotion, and with the same sincerity and resolution.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe history of Judah is resumed 2 Kings 14:1-22, followed by a brief account of the contemporary history of Israel under Jeroboam II 2 Kings 14:23-29. The earlier narrative runs parallel with 2 Chronicles 25. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryCHAPTER 142Ki 14:1-6. Amaziah's Good Reign over Judah.Amaziah’s good reign: his justice on the murderers of his father: his victory over Edom: warreth against Jehoash king of Israel; is overcome by him, and slain by his own people: Azariah succeedeth him,  2 Kings 14:1-22. Jehoash dieth; and Jeroboam his son is king over Israel; his acts and death: Zachariah his son succeedeth him,  2 Kings 14:23-29.  In the second year of Joash,  i.e. after he began to reign alone; for he reigned two or three years with his father; of which See Poole \"2 Kings 13:10\". Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleIn the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah. As Joash king of Israel began to reign in the thirty seventh of Joash king of Judah, 2 Kings 13:10, who reigned forty years, Amaziah must therefore begin his reign in the fourth of Joash king of Israel; this therefore must be understood of his second year after he reigned alone, for he reigned two or three years in his father's lifetime.
