The Lord will cast off any professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners.

There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.",
