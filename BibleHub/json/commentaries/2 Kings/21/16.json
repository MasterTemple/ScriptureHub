Some culminating horror is required, something not touched upon before, and something specially attaching to the monarch himself.

Josephus declares positively that Manasseh \"cruelly put to death all the righteous among the Hebrews, and did not even spare the prophets\" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:3. § 1). A tradition, very widely received, declared Isaiah to have been one of the victims ('Gemara Jebam.,' 4:13; 'Sanhedr.,' f. 103; Tertullian, 'De Patientia,' § 14; Augustine, 'De Cir. Dei,' 18:24, etc.). Stanley says, \"A reign of terror commenced against all who ventured to resist the reaction. Day by day a fresh batch of the prophetic order were ordered for execution. It seemed as if a devouring lion were let loose against them. From end to end of Jerusalem were to be seen traces of their blood. The nobles who took their part were thrown headlong from the rocky cliffs of Jerusalem\" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' pt. 2. p. 492).
