The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays.

Jehoash Reigns Well while Jehoiada Lived.Matthew Poole's Commentary2 KINGS Chapter 12 Jehoash reigneth well all the days of Jehoiada: he giveth order for the repair of the temple,  2 Kings 12:1-16. He diverteth Hazael from Jerusalem by a present of the hallowed treasures: he is slain by his servants: Amaziah suceedeth him,  2 Kings 12:17-21.  No text from Poole on this verse. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleIn the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign,.... So that he reigned twenty one or twenty two years contemporary with Jehu's reign, for Jehu reigned twenty eight years: and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem; the same number of years David and Solomon reigned: and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba; a city in the tribe of Simeon, in the extreme part of the land of Canaan southward; her name in the Chaldee dialect is Tabitha, the same with Dorcas in Greek, Acts 9:36.
