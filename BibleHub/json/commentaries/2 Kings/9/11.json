When Jehu came out again to his comrades in arms, after the departure of the pupil of the prophets, they inquired השׁלום, i.e., \"is it all well? why did this madman come to thee?\" not because they were afraid that he might have done him some injury (Ewald), or that he might have brought some evil tidings (Thenius), but simply because they conjectured that he had brought some important news. They called the prophet משׁגּע, a madman, in derision, with reference to the ecstatic utterances of the prophets when in a state of holy inspiration. Jehu answered evasively, \"Ye know the man and his muttering,\" i.e., ye know that he is mad and says nothing rational. שׂיה includes both meditating and speaking.",
