We read there also of revolts against Joram by the Philistines and the Arabians, and that by the latter all the king’s family were cut off except his youngest son. Moreover that when he died the people made no burning for him, as had been done at the death of his ancestors, and that ‘he departed without being desired’, i.e. none missed him or lamented for him when he died. Also that though buried in the city of David, his body was not put into the sepulchres of the kings. This last statement is no contradiction of what is contained in verse 24 of this chapter.",
