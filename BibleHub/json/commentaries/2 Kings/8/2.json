The woman arose, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines — Which, though bordering upon Israel, was free from the famine: by which it appeared, that the special hand of God was in that calamity, and that it was a judgment from him upon the Israelites for their idolatry, and abuse of the means of grace, which they now enjoyed in such abundance through Elisha and many other prophets.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary8:1-6 The kindness of the good Shunammite to Elisha, was rewarded by the care taken of her in famine. It is well to foresee an evil, and wisdom, when we foresee it, to hide ourselves if we lawfully may do so. When the famine was over, she returned out of the land of the Philistines; that was no proper place for an Israelite, any longer than there was necessity for it. Time was when she dwelt so securely among her own people, that she had no occasion to be spoken for to the king; but there is much uncertainty in this life, so that things or persons may fail us which we most depend upon, and those befriend us which we think we shall never need. Sometimes events, small in themselves, prove of consequence, as here; for they made the king ready to believe Gehazi's narrative, when thus confirmed. It made him ready to grant her request, and to support a life which was given once and again by miracle.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe country of the Philistines - the rich low grain-growing plain along the seacoast of Judah - was always a land of plenty compared with the highlands of Palestine. Moreover, if food failed there, it was easily imported by sea from the neighboring Egypt. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary2. she … sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years—Their territory was recommended to her from its contiguity to her usual residence; and now that this state had been so greatly reduced, there was less risk than formerly from the seductions of idolatry; and many of the Jews and Israelites were residing there. Besides, an emigration thither was less offensive to the king of Israel than going to sojourn in Judah.Matthew Poole's Commentary Either because that was near her lands and dwelling, which she thought she might have an eye to, when occasion required; or because there was more plenty than in Judah; or because she knew that her going to dwell in Judah would be very displeasing to the king of Israel, whose favour she was like to need hereafter. Nor was there now that danger of idolatry from the Philistines as there had been formerly, because their power and influence was now grown inconsiderable, and probably many of the Jews and Israelites lived among them. And this land, though bordering upon Israel, was free from this famine, that it might appear that this was a special hand and judgment of God upon the Israelites for their idolatry, and for their unprofitableness under all the means of grace which now they plentifully enjoyed by Elisha and many other prophets; which the Philistines not enjoying, their sin was much less, and therefore their present condition was better. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God,.... Whose words she had reason to believe; she having a son given to her according to his word, and this restored to life, when dead, through his intercession: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines; which was not far from her native place, and where there was plenty of food, and she could have as free an exercise of her religion as in the idolatrous kingdom of Israel.
