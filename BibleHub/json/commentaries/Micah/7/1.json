So I look in vain for any good men left (Mic 7:2).The church, complaining of the scarcity of good men, Micah 7:1,2, and the general corruption, Micah 7:3,4, putteth not confidence in man, but in God, Micah 7:5-7.

God’s mercies to his people, Micah 7:18-20.  All are agreed in the scope and meaning of these words, that they are designed a complaint for the great scarcity of men that feared God, did justice, and loved mercy; and so the prophet begins with a pathetical complaint, Woe is me! ordinarily this phrase is minatory, but here it is lamentation, as every eye may see who discerns the propriety of the Hebrew. For I;  either the prophet in his own person, or else in the person of the good man; or, by a usual figure, the land may be brought in, complaining, that whereas it was once well stored, now it hath few right good in it. Am as when they have gathered the summer fruits;  all the fair, goodly, and ripe fruit gathered, none left, or none but evil fruit, such as the labourers thought not worth gathering up. So is the harvest of Israel and Judah too; though I and other prophets have sown good seed abundantly, yet goodness comes up very thin and scarce: so Isaiah 24:13,16. As the grape-gleanings of the vintage,  the same complaint in a like elegant metaphor, drawn from the vintage-gatherer, who leaves but few scattering single grapes. So Israel and Judah, which in bringing forth good men should have been as a fruitful vine full of clusters, but barren they have been, and are; and good men, i.e. just, compassionate, and humble men, are as grapes after the vintage is gathered. There is no cluster to eat;  such good men’s converse would as much delight, refresh, and encourage me, as a fair cluster of grapes doth a thirsty and hungry person, but there is not one such cluster. My soul desired;  it speaks a vehement desire. The first-ripe fruit;  it is an ellipsis or aposiopesis, and to be supplied thus, but there was, or I found, none. ",
