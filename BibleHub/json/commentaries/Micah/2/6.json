What bonds will hold those who have no reverence for God's word? Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land they have polluted. You shall not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shall destroy you. Apply this to our state in this present world. There is corruption in the world through lust, and we should keep at a distance from it. It is not our rest: it was designed for our passage, but not for our portion; our inn, but not our home; here we have no continuing city; let us therefore arise and depart, let us seek a continuing city above. Since they will be deceived, let them be deceived. Teachers who recommend self-indulgence by their doctrine and example, best suit such sinners.",

Maurer translates the latter clause, \"they shall not prophesy of such things\" (as in Mic 2:3-5, these being rebellious Israel's words); \"let them not prophesy\"; \"they never cease from insult\" (from prophesying insults to us). English Version is supported by the parallelism: wherein the similarity of sound and word implies how exactly God makes their punishment answer to their sin, and takes them at their own word. \"Prophesy,\" literally, \"drop\" (De 32:2; Eze 21:2).",

Orelli makes the two last clauses Micah's answer to the interdict of the adversaries, \"Should one not prophesy of these things? Should reproaches (against the true prophets) never cease?\" We prefer the interpretations given above, and consider the prophet's reply to be given in the next verse. Micah 2:6",
