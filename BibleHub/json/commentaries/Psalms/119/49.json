Let us be certain we have the Divine law for what we believe, and then let not scoffers prevail upon us to decline from it. God's judgments of old comfort and encourage us, for he is still the same. Sin is horrible in the eyes of all that are sanctified. Ere long the believer will be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. In the mean time, the statutes of the Lord supply subjects for grateful praise. In the season of affliction, and in the silent hours of the night, he remembers the name of the Lord, and is stirred up to keep the law. All who have made religion the first thing, will own that they have been unspeakable gainers by it.",

There is a world of meaning in that word \"remember,\" as it is addressed to God; it is used in Scripture in the tenderest sense, and suits the sorrowing and the depressed. Tim Psalmist cried, \"Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions\": Job also prayed that the Lord would appoint him a set time, and remember him. In the present instance the prayer is as personal as the \"Remember me\" of the thief, for its essence lies in the words - \"unto thy servant\" It would be all in vain for us if the promise were remembered to all others if it did not come true to ourselves; but there is no fear, for the Lord has never forgotten a single promise to a single believer.",

He cannot have caused us to hope without cause. If we hope upon his word we have a sure basis: our gracious Lord would never mock us by exciting false hopes. Hope deferred maketh the heart sick, hence the petition for immediate remembrance of the cheering word. Moreover, it is the hope of a servant, and it is not possible that a great and good master would disappoint his dependent; if such a master's word were not kept it could only be through an oversight, hence the anxious cry, \"Remember.\" Our great Master will not forget his won servants, nor disappoint the expectation which he himself has raised. because we are the Lord's, and endeavour to remember his word by obeying it, we may be sure that he will think upon his own servants, and remember his own promise by making it good.",
