In the great day, our God shall come, and make those hear his judgement who would not hearken to his law. Happy are those who come into the covenant of grace, by faith in the Redeemer's atoning sacrifice, and show the sincerity of their love by fruits of righteousness. When God rejects the services of those who rest in outside performances, he will graciously accept those who seek him aright. It is only by sacrifice, by Christ, the great Sacrifice, from whom the sacrifices of the law derived what value they had, that we can be accepted of God.

Even thus should we wait the long-promised appearing of the Lord from heaven. \"And shall not keep silence.\" He comes to speak, to plead with his people, to accuse and judge the ungodly. He has been silent long in patience, but soon he will speak with power. What a moment of awe when the Omnipotent is expected to reveal himself! What will be the reverent joy and solemn expectation when the poetic scene of this Psalm becomes in the last great day an actual reality! \"A fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.\" Flame and hurricane are frequently described as the attendants of the divine appearance. \"Our God is a consuming fire.\" \"At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.\" ",
