Before he sets down the folly of carnal security, he lays down, from his own experience, the benefit and comfort of a holy, gracious security, which they enjoy who trust in God, and not in their worldly wealth. In the day of judgment, the iniquity of our heels, or of our steps, our past sins, will compass us.

        "text": "\"I will incline mine ear to a parable.\" He who would have others hear, begins by hearing himself. As the minstrel leans his ear to his harp, so must the preacher give his whole soul to his ministry. The truth came to the Psalmist as a parable, and he endeavoured to unriddle it for popular use; he would not leave the truth in obscurity, but he listened to its voice till he so well understood it as to be able to interpret and translate it into the common language of the multitude. Still of necessity it would remain a problem, and a dark saying to the unenlightened many, but this would not be the songster's fault, for, saith he, \"I will open my dark saying upon the harp.\" The writer was no mystic, delighting in deep and cloudy things, yet he was not afraid of the most profound topics; he tried to open the treasures of darkness, and to uplift pearls from the deep. To win attention he cast his proverbial philosophy into the form of song, and tuned his harp to the solemn tone of his subject. Let us gather round the minstrel of the King of kings, and hear the Psalm which erst was led by the chief musician, as the chorus of the sons of Korah lifted up their voices in the temple. THE ARGUMENT This Psalm is penned upon the same occasion with Psalm 39 Psa 73, to wit, upon the contemplation of the afflictions of God’s people and of the prosperity and glory of ungodly men The design is to justify God’s providence in this dark dispensation, and to show that, all things being considered, good men have no cause for immoderate dejection of spirit, nor wicked men for glorying in their present felicities. The psalmist having stirred up all men to attention, Psalm 49:1-5, showeth their vain trust in riches, Psalm 49:6-14; and the contrary trust of the faithful in God, Psalm 49:15; exhorteth them not to fear the prosperity of the wicked, for it cannot deliver him from the grave, Psalm 49:16-20.  All ye people,  Heb. all people; Jews or Gentiles; for all are concerned in this matter, as being apt to stumble and murmur at it. ",
