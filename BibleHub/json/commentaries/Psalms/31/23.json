All the saints are benefited by the sanctified miseries of one, if they are led by earnest exhortations to love their Lord the better. If saints do not love the Lord, who will? Love is the universal debt of all the saved family: who would wish to be exonerated from its payment? Reasons for love are given, for believing love is not blind. \"For the Lord preserveth the faithful.\" They have to bide their time, but the recompense comes at last, and meanwhile all the cruel malice of their enemies cannot destroy them. \"And plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.\" This also is cause for gratitude: pride is so detestable in its acts that he who shall mete out to it its righteous due, deserves the love of all holy minds.",
