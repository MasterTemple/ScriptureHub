Why will he always dwell on this? Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measure the value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off his grey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they have done. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when nature is sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples of Christ owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemn testimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God's promises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of the Redeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days, while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israel with all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, and singing his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, and have earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought, above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lamb that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessing and praise.",

We may always hope, for we always have grounds for it: we will always hope, for it is a never-failing consolation. \"And will yet praise thee more and more.\" He was not slack in thanksgiving; in fact, no man was ever more diligent in it; yet he was not content with all his former praises, but vowed to become more and more a grateful worshipper. When good things are both continual and progressive with us, we are on the right tack. We ought to be misers in doing good; and our motto should be \"more and more.\" While we do not disdain to \"rest and be thankful,\" we cannot settle down into resting in our thankfulness. \"Superior,\" cries the eagle, as he mounts towards the sun: higher and yet higher is also our aims, as we soar aloft in duty and devotion.

The faithfulness of God in saving us, in delivering us out of the hand of our enemies, and in fulfilling his promises, is to be everywhere proclaimed by those who have proved it in their own history. How gloriously conspicuous is righteousness in the divine plan of redemption! It should be the theme of constant discourse. The devil rages against the substitutionary sacrifice, and errorists of every form make this the main point of their attack; be it ours, therefore, to love the doctrine, and to spread its glad tidings on every side, and at all times. Mouths are never so usefully employed as in recounting the righteousness of God revealed in the salvation of believers in Jesus. The preacher who should be confined to this one theme would never need seek another: it is the medulla theologiae, the very pith and marrow of revealed truth. Has our reader been silent upon this choice subject? Let us, then, press him to tell abroad what he enjoys within: he does not well who keeps such glad tidings to himself. \"For I know not the numbers thereof\" He knew the sweetness of it, the sureness, the glory, and the truth of it; but as to the full reckoning of its plentitude, variety, and sufficiency, he felt he could not reach to the height of the great argument. Lord, where I cannot count I will believe, and when a truth surpasses numeration I will take to admiration. When David spoke of his enemies, he said they were more in number than the hairs of his head; he had, therefore, some idea of their number, and found a figure suitable to set it out; but, in the case of the Lord's covenant mercies, he declares, \"I know not the number,\" and does not venture upon any sort of comparison. To creatures belong number and limit, to God and his grace there is neither. We may, therefore, continue to tell out his great salvation all day long, for the theme is utterly inexhaustible.",

He should ever be a welcome guest who can tell us of the mighty acts of the Lord, and help us to put our trust in him. The authorised version may be used by us as a resolve in all our exertions and endeavors. In our own strength we must fall; but, when we hear the voice which saith, \"Go in this thy might,\" we may advance without fear. Though hell itself were in the way, the believer would pursue the path of duty, crying, \"I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.\" Man's righteousness is not fit to be mentioned - filthy rags are best hidden; neither is there any righteousness under heaven, or in heaven, comparable to the divine. As God himself fills all space, and is, therefore, the only God, leaving no room for another, so God's righteousness, in Christ Jesus, fills the believer's soul, and he counts all other things but dross and dung \"that he may win Christ, and be found in him, not having his own righteousness which is of the law, but the righteousness which is of God by faith.\" What would be the use of speaking upon any other righteousness to a dying man? and all are dying men. Let those who will cry up man's natural innocence, the dignity Of the race, the purity of philosophers, the loveliness of untutored savages, the power of sacraments, and the infallibility of pontiffs; this is the true believer's immovable resolve, \"I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.\" For ever dedicated to thee, my Lord, be this poor, unworthy tongue, whose glory it shall be to glorify thee.

The mighty acts of the Lord shall form his theme, together with the righteousness of God, and of none other (ver. 16). As God has enabled him to declare his praise in the past (ver. 17), so he trusts to be still upheld and enabled to proclaim the same to the new generation (ver. 18). God's righteousness is \"very high,\" and there is none like him (ver. 19). When he. brings men into trouble, it is only to \"turn again and comfort them\" (vers. 20, 21). In conclusion, the writer promises that his hymns of praise  shall not only be said, but sung, and accompanied with the melody of music (ver. 22).
