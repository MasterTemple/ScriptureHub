Let none expect ease or comfort from the world. Those who love the Lord, often are hated and persecuted; men wondered at for their principles and conduct; but the Lord has been their strong refuge. The faithful servants of God may be assured that he will not cast them off in old age, nor forsake them when their strength fails.",

Psalm 83:19): Thy righteousness (which has been in mercy turned towards me), Thine alone (te solum  equals  tui solius).
