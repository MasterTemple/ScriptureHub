God knows our faith, and yet he loves to hear us avow it; hence, the Psalmist not only trusts in the Lord, but tells him that he is so trusting. \"Let me never be put to confusion.\" So long as the world stands, stand thou by me; yea, for ever and ever be faithful to thy servants. If thou forsake me, men will ridicule my religion, and how shall I be able to answer them? Confusion will silence me, and thy cause will be put to shame.

THE ARGUMENT The matter of this Psalm plainly showeth that it was written in a time of David’s great distress, and his old age, mentioned Psalm 71:9 and Psalm 71:18 which proves that it belongs not to Saul’s time, but rather to the time of Absalom’s rebellion, which happened in his old age. The psalmist, in confidence of his faith, and in experience of past favours, prayeth unto God to deliver him, but consume his enemies, Psalm 71:1-13; promising constancy of hope in him, Psalm 71:14-16; praying for his persevering strength and power, Psalm 71:17,18; acknowledgeth his troubles to be from God, Psalm 71:19-21; Promiseth thankfulness to him for his deliverance, Psalm 71:22-24.  This verse and the next are taken out of Psalm 31:1,2. ",
