Do the enemies of the church act with one consent to destroy it, and shall not the friends of the church be united? Wicked men wish that there might be no religion among mankind. They would gladly see all its restraints shaken off, and all that preach, profess, or practise it, cut off. This they would bring to pass if it were in their power. The enemies of God's church have always been many: this magnifies the power of the Lord in preserving to himself a church in the world.",

THE ARGUMENT The occasion of the Psalm is manifest from the body of it, and it seems to have been a dangerous attempt and conspiracy. of divers neighbouring nations against Israel or Judah. Probably it was that which is mentioned 2 Chronicles 20, wherein all the people here mentioned might be engaged, though all of them be not there expressed; this being usual in the sacred historians, for the latter to record some passages which the former omitted. Or it may belong to some other history. Or it may have a more general respect unto the several enterprises and combinations of all these people against them, some at one time, and some at another. The church’s complaint to God of her enemies’ conspiracies, Psalm 83:1-8. Her prayer against oppressors, Psalm 83:9-15, that God would fill them with shame, and make them know that he alone is Jehovah, Psalm 83:16-18.  Keep not thou silence;  plead for us, not by words, but by thine actions. Hold not thy peace;  or, be not deaf, to our prayers, and to the blasphemies of thine and our enemies.
