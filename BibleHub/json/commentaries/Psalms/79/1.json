Thus, the holy land, the holy house, and the holy city, were all polluted by the uncircumcised. It is an awful thing when wicked men are found in the church and numbered with her ministry. Then are the tares sown with the wheat, and the poisoned gourds cast into the pot. \"They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.\" After devouring and defiling, they have come to destroying, and have done their work with a cruel completeness. Jerusalem, the beloved city, the joy of the nation, the abode of her God, was totally wrecked. Alas! alas, for Israel! It is sad to see the foe in our own house, but worse to meet him in the house of God: they strike hardest who smite at our religion. The Psalmist piles up the agony; he was a suppliant, and he knew how to bring out the strong points of his case. We ought to order our case before the Lord with as much care as if our success depended on our pleading.

Beasts on which man could not feed fed on him. The flesh of creation's Lord became meat for carrion crows and hungry dogs. Dire are the calamities of war, yet have they happened to God's saints and servants. This might well move the heart of the poet, and he did well to appeal to the heart of God by reciting the grievous evil. Such might have been the lamentation of an early Christian as he thought of the amphitheatre and all its deeds of blood. Note in the two verses how the plea is made to turn upon God's property in the temple and the people: - we read \"thine inheritance,\" \"thy temple, thy servants,\" and \"thy saints.\" Surely the Lord will defend his own, and will not suffer rampant adversaries to despoil them.",

This was a serious trial and grievous horror to the Jews, who evinced much care concerning their burials. Has it come to this, that there are none to bury the dead of thy family, O Lord? Can none be found to grant a shovelful of earth with which to cover up the poor bodies of thy murdered saints? What woe is here!

The psalmist, complaining of the desolation and ruin of Jerusalem, Psalm 79:1-4, expostulateth with God about his long anger and jealousy, Psalm 79:5-7; entreateth for the forgiveness of their sins, and speedy help and mercy, Psalm 79:8-12, to the everlasting praise of his name, Psalm 79:13.  Are come,  as invaders and conquerors. Into thine inheritance; into Canaan and Judea, which thou didst choose for thine inheritance.
