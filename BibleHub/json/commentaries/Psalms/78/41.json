Isaiah 42:13), i.e., His anger in all its fulness and intensity.

The fact that man is flesh (which not merely affirms his physical fragility, but also his moral weakness, Genesis 6:3, cf. Genesis 8:21), and that, after a short life, he falls a prey to death, determines God to be long-suffering and kind; it was in fact sensuous desire and loathing by which Israel was beguiled time after time. The exclamation \"how oft!\" Psalm 78:40, calls attention to the praiseworthiness of this undeserved forbearance.",
