While his people express confidence and joy, and animate each other in serving him, let sinners submit to his authority, and accept his salvation. Jesus Christ shall subdue the Gentiles; he shall bring them as sheep into the fold, not for slaughter, but for preservation. He shall subdue their affections, and make them a willing people in the day of his power. Also it speaks of his giving them rest and settlement. Apply this spiritually; the Lord himself has undertaken to be the inheritance of his people. It shows the faith and submission of the saints.

But as Zion was a type of the church, and the ark a type of Christ; so this hath a further reference, even to Christ’s ascension into heaven, and, as consequent thereunto, to the spreading of his kingdom in all the parts and nations of the world; which is the chief scope and design of the psalmist. or at least of the Holy Ghost, in this Psalm; as will plainly appear from the words and matter of it. The church is exhorted to praise God, who subdueth her enemies, Psalm 47:1-3, and giveth her an excellent inheritance, Psalm 47:4-7. A promise of calling and gathering the Gentiles, Psalm 47:8,9.  All ye people;  either, 1. All the tribes of Israel; for the several tribes are sometimes called several people. See Judges 5:14 Ezekiel 2:3 Acts 4:27. Or, 2. All nations, not only Jews, but Gentiles; for all of them either had or might have benefit by the ark, upon their addresses to God there, and especially by Christ and his ascension.
