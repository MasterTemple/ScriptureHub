Some suppose that of David should be connected with the name of the composition, and not with \"house\"; and refer for the occasion to the selection of a site for the temple (1Ch 21:26-30; 22:1). But \"house\" is never used absolutely for the temple, and \"dedication\" does not well apply to such an occasion. Though the phrase in the Hebrew, \"dedication of the house of David,\" is an unusual form, yet it is equally unusual to disconnect the name of the author and the composition. As a \"dedication of David's house\" (as provided, De 20:5), the scope of the Psalm well corresponds with the state of repose and meditation on his past trials suited to such an occasion (2Sa 5:11; 7:2). For beginning with a celebration of God's delivering favor, in which he invites others to join, he relates his prayer in distress, and God's gracious and prompt answer.",

The Psalmist's praise was reasonable. He had a reason to give for the praise that was in his heart. He had been drawn up like a prisoner from a dungeon, like Joseph out of the pit, and therefore he loved his deliverer. Grace has uplifted us from the pit of hell, from the ditch of sin, from the Slough of Despond, from the bed of sickness, from the bondage of doubts and fears: have we no song to offer for all this? How high has our Lord lifted us? Lifted us up into the children's place, to be adopted into the family; lifted us up into union with Christ, \"to sit together with him in heavenly places.\" Lift high the name of our God, for he has lifted us above the stars. \"And hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.\" This was the judgment which David most feared out of the three evils; he said, let me fall into the hand of the Lord, and not into the hand of man. Terrible indeed were our lot if we were delivered over to the will of our enemies. Blessed be the Lord, we have been preserved from so dire a fate. The devil and all our spiritual enemies have not been permitted to rejoice over us; for we have been saved from the fowler's snare. Our evil companions, who prophesied that we should go back to our old sins, are disappointed. Those who watched for our halting, and would fain say, \"Aha! Aha! So would we have it!\" have watched in vain until now. O happy they whom the Lord keeps so consistent in character that the lynx eyes of the world can see no real fault in them. Is this our case? let us ascribe all the glory to him who has sustained us in our integrity.",

He went at once to headquarters, and not roundabout to fallible means. God is the best physician, even for our bodily infirmities. We do very wickedly and foolishly when we forget God. It was a sin in Asa that he trusted to physicians and not to God. If we must have a physician, let it be so, but still let us go to our God first of all; and, above all, remember that there can be no power to heal in medicine of itself; the healing energy must flow from the divine hand. If our watch is out of order, we take it to the watchmaker; if body or soul be in an evil plight, let us resort to him who created them, and has unfailing skill to put them in right condition. As for our spiritual diseases, nothing can heal these evils but the touch of the Lord Christ if we do but touch the hem of his garment, we shall be made whole, while if we embrace all other physicians in our arms, they can do us no service. \"O Lord my God.\" Observe the covenant name which faith uses - \"my God.\" Thrice happy is he who can claim the Lord himself to be his portion. Note how David's faith ascends the scale; he sang \"O Lord\" in the first verse, but it is \"O Lord my God,\" in the second. Heavenly heart-music is an ascending thing, like the pillars of smoke which rose from the altar of incense. \"I cried unto thee.\" I could hardly pray, but I cried; I poured out my soul as a little child pours out its desires. I cried to my God: I knew to whom to cry; I did not cry to my friends, or to any arm of flesh. Hence the sure and satisfactory result - \"Thou hast healed me.\" I know it. I am sure of it. I have the evidence of spiritual health within me now: glory be to thy name! Every humble suppliant with God who seeks release from the disease of sin, shall speed as well as the Psalmist did, but those who will not so much as seek a cure, need not wonder if their wounds putrefy and their soul dies.",

David is quite sure, beyond a doubt, that God has done great things for him, whereof he is exceeding glad. He had descended to the brink of the sepulchre, and yet was restored to tell of the forbearance of God; nor was this all, he owned that nothing but grace had kept him from the lowest hell, and this made him doubly thankful. To be spared from the grave is much: to be delivered from the pit is more; hence there is growing cause for praise, since both deliverances are alone traceable to the glorious right hand of the Lord, who is the only preserver of life, and the only Redeemer of our souls from hell. A Psalm and Song; or, A Psalm of Song; i.e. either, 1. A Psalm to be sung with the voice to an instrument. Or, 2. A Psalm of joy and praise; for so this is. And this Hebrew word schir may be here taken not simply for a song, but for a joyful song, as it is Genesis 31:27 Exodus 15:1 Psalm 33:3 42:8 Proverbs 25:20 Isaiah 30:29 Amos 8:3,10. At the dedication of the house of David; either, 1. At the dedication of the temple, called the house, or that house, eminently and emphatically. So the Chaldee paraphrast and the Hebrew doctors understand it. And then the last words, of David, are to be joined with the first, a Psalm and Song. But this seems not probable, because the temple was not built by David, nor in his days, although he might prescribe a Psalm to be used afterwards upon that occasion. Or, 2. At the dedication of David’s house, which was built, 2 Samuel 5:11, and doubtless was dedicated, as God had commanded. See Deu 20:5 Nehemiah 12:27. Or, 3. At the second dedication of David’s house, after it had been polluted by Absalom and his concubines. But there is no law of God for any re-dedication of houses in such cases, nor any evidence that David did so. And indeed it seems strange, if this Psalm was made upon this occasion, or upon any of these dedications here mentioned, that there should not be one line in it suitable to that occasion. Others therefore make these words, the dedication of the house,  not to note the matter of this Psalm or Song; but either, 1. The name of the tune to which this song was sung, which was the same that David used at the dedication of his house; and so this gives us a reason why the word Song is added to that of Psalm, and why this Psalm was called the Song of the dedication. Or, 2. The time when it was sung; which was at the dedication of David’s house. For such dedications were performed in a very solemn manner, with divers rites and prayers, and praises to God, as the nature of that business required. And it seems probable from the matter of this Psalm, compared with the title, that David had about this time been delivered from some eminent distresses, and particularly from some dangerous sickness; for which he here gives thanks to God, taking advantage of this public and solemn occasion. The psalmist praiseth God for deliverance out of great danger, Psalm 30:1-3; and exhorteth others to do the same, Psalm 30:4,5. He acknowledgeth to God that his prayer was heard, and him-self girded with gladness, Psalm 30:6-11. He will give thanks to God for ever, Psalm 30:12.  Lifted me up;  or, drawn up, to wit, out of the deep pit, or waters; to which great dangers and afflictions are frequently compared. To rejoice over me;  which they both desired and confidently expected an occasion to do. ",
