And he resolved, if God should permit him, to erect a magnificent structure wherein the ark of God should be placed, and God’s solemn worship performed.” Bishop Patrick’s paraphrase is to the same purport: “I will not come into the new palace which I have built for myself, much less go to dwell and take up my lodging there; nay, I will not lay myself down to rest, nor take a wink of sleep, until I have found out a convenient place for the ark of the Lord, a habitation for that mighty one; who there makes himself present to his people the posterity of Jacob.” Henry supposes that, having procrastinated too long, amidst his difficulties, upon his first accession to the throne, “he one morning made a vow, that, before night, he would come to a resolution in this matter, and would determine the place where the tent should be fixed for the reception of the ark.” Some think that the spot on which the temple should be built was intended, and that David made this vow on the morning of the day of the pestilence, which cut off so many in Israel because he had numbered the people; and that the thrashing- floor of Ornan was pointed out to him in consequence of this resolution.",

It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.",
