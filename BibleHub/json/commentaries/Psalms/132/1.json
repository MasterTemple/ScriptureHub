It is good in the morning to fix upon work for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what a day may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek to have our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. He prays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he had built; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do their duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit of our own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness of merit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is an anointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace. The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer their petitions for his Son's sake.",

Jehovah, who changes not, will never forget one of his servants, or fail to keep his covenant; yet for this thing he is to be entreated. That which we are assured the Lord will do must, nevertheless, be made a matter of prayer. The request is that the Lord would remember, and this is a word full of meaning. We know that the Lord remembered Noah, and assuaged the flood; he remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of Sodom; he remembered Rachel, and Hannah, and gave them children; he remembered his mercy to the house of Israel, and delivered his people. That is a choice song wherein we sing, \"He remembered us in our low estate - for his mercy endureth for ever\"; and that is a notable prayer, \"Lord, remember me.\" The plea is urged with God that he would bless the family of David for the sake of their progenitor; how much stronger is our master-argument in prayer that God would deal well with us for Jesus' sake! David had no personal merit; the plea is based upon the covenant graciously made with him: but Jesus has deserts which are his own, and of boundless merit - these we may urge without hesitation. When the Lord was angry with the reigning prince, the people cried, \"Lord, remember David\"; and when they needed any special blessing, again they sang, \"Lord, remember David.\" This was good pleading, but it was not so good as ours, which runs on this wise, \"Lord, remember Jesus, and all his afflictions.\"",

There was always an ungodly party in the nation, and these persons were never slow to slander, hinder, and molest the servant of the Lord. Whatever were David's faults, he kept true to the one, only, living, and true God; and for this he was a speckled bird among monarchs. Since he zealously delighted in the worship of Jehovah, his God, he was despised and ridiculed by those who could not understand his enthusiasm. God will never forget what his people suffer for his sake. No doubt innumerable blessings descend upon families and nations through the godly lives and patient sufferings of the saints. We cannot be saved by the merits of others, but beyond all question we are benefited by their virtues. Paul saith, \"God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have showed toward his name.\" Under the New Testament dispensation, as well as under the Old, there is a full reward for the righteous. That reward frequently comes upon their descendants rather than upon themselves: they sow, and their successors reap. We may at this day pray - Lord, remember the martyrs and confessors of our race, who suffered for thy name's sake, and bless our people and nation with gospel grace for our fathers' sakes.",

David, when God had graciously declared his acceptance of David’s desire to build a house for God. and his purpose of establishing the kingdom to David and his seed for ever: or, 2. Solomon, as may be gathered from the whole matter of the Psalm, which seems better to agree to him than to David; and particularly from Psalm 132:8-10, compared with 2 Chronicles 6:41,42, where we have the same words with no great alteration. David in prayer commendeth unto God the care he had for the ark, Psalm 132:1-7; with his prayer over it, Psalm 132:8-10. A rehearsal of God’s oath and promises of the everlasting kingdom of Christ, Psalm 132:11-18.  Remember David;  either, 1. Thy covenant made with David; or rather, 2. David’s eminent piety and zeal for thy service, amplified by the following clause. All his afflictions;  all his sufferings for thy sake, all the solicitude of his mind, all his hard and wearisome labours for thy service and glory, and for provisions towards the building of thy temple, and for the establishment of thy people in peace and tranquillity, that so way might be made for that great work.
