But if the feeling of sin in the heart causes desires to be rid of it; if it be the presence of one urging a demand we know we must not, cannot comply with, this is an argument of sincerity. And when we pray in simplicity and godly sincerity, our prayers will be answered. This will excite gratitude to Him who hath not turned away our prayer nor his mercy from us.

Even the thankful heart dares not come to God without a victim of grateful praise; of this as well as of every other form of worship, we may Say, \"the blood is the life thereof.\" Reader, never attempt to come before God without Jesus, the divinely promised, given, and accepted burnt offering. \"I will pay thee my vows.\" He would not appear before the Lord empty, but at the same time he would not boast of what he offered, seeing it was all due on account of former vows. After all, our largest gifts are but payments; when we have given all, we must confess, \"O Lord, of thine own have we given unto thee.\" We should be slow in making vows, but prompt in discharging them. When we are released from trouble, and can once more go up to the house of the Lord, we should take immediate occasion to fulfil our promises.

His vows had been wrung from him; extreme distress burst open the door of his lips, and out rushed the vow like a long pent-up torrent, which had at last found a vent. What we were so eager to vow, we should be equally earnest to perform; but, alas! many a vow runs so fast in words that it lames itself for deeds. \"And my mouth hath spoken.\" He had made the promise public, and had no desire to go back; an honest man is always ready to acknowledge a debt. \"When I was in trouble.\" Distress suggested the vow; God in answer to the vow removed the distress, and now the votary desires to make good his promise. It is well for each man to remember that he was in trouble, proud spirits are apt to speak as if the road had always been smooth for them, as if no dog dare bark at their nobility, and scarce a drop of rain would venture to besprinkle their splendour; yet these very upstarts were probably once so low in spirits and condition that they would have been glad enough of the help of those they now despise. Even great Caesar, whose look did awe the world, must have his trouble and become weak as other men; so that his enemy could say in bitterness, \"When the fit was on him, I did mark how he did shake.\" Of the strong and vigorous man the nurse could tell a tale of weakness, and his wife could say of the boaster, \"I did hear him groan; his coward lips did from their colour fly.\" All men have trouble, but they act not in the same manner while under it; the profane take to swearing and the godly to praying.

Of all we have we should give the Lord his portion, and that should be the choicest we can select. It was no waste to burn the fat upon Jehovah's altar, nor to pour the precious ointment upon Jesus's head; neither are large gifts and bountiful offerings to the church of God any diminution to a man's estate: such money is put to good interest and placed where it cannot be stolen by thieves nor corroded by rust. \"I will offer bullets with goats.\" A perfect sacrifice, completing the circle of offerings, should show forth the intense love of his heart. We should magnify the Lord with the great and the littler. None of his ordinances Should be disregarded; we must not omit either the bullocks or the goats.
