Composers of tunes for the congregation should see to it that their airs are cheerful; we need not so much noise, as joyful noise. God is to be praised with the voice, and the heart should go therewith in holy exultation. All praise from all nations should be rendered unto the Lord. Happy the day when no shouts shall be presented to Juggernaut or Buddha, but all the earth shall adore the Creator thereof. All ye lands.

Looking upon the convulsions which have shaken continents, the hurricanes which have devastated nations, the plagues which have desolated cities, and other great and amazing displays of divine working, men may well say: \"How terrible art thou in thy works.\" Till we see God in Christ, the terrible predominates in all our apprehensions of him. \"Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee;\" but, as the Hebrew clearly intimates, it will be a forced and false submission. Power brings a man to his knee, but love alone wins his heart. Pharaoh said he would let Israel go, but he lied unto God; he submitted in word but not in deed. Tens of thousands, both in earth and hell, are rendering this constrained homage to the Almighty; they only submit because they cannot do otherwise; it is not their loyalty, but his power, which keeps them subjects of his boundless dominion.",

He promiseth unto God thanksgiving, and to pay the vows he made in trouble, Psalm 66:13-15; calling to others to see God’s goodness to his soul, blesseth him for it, Psalm 66:16-20.  Ye people of all nations, who have seen the wonderful power, and wisdom, and fidelity, and goodness of God in our deliverance, it becomes you to acknowledge it with admiration and rejoicing. Or, all the land,  or this land. But the former sense is more probable from Psalm 66:4, where this word is so used.
