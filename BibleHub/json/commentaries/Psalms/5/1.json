The most encouraging principle of prayer, and the most powerful plea in prayer, is, to look upon him as our King and our God. David also prays to a sin-hating God. sin is folly, and sinners are the greatest of all fools; fools of their own making. Wicked people hate God; justly are they hated of him, and this will be their endless misery and ruin. Let us learn the importance of truth and sincerity, in all the affairs of life. Liars and murderers resemble the devil, and are his children, therefore it may well be expected that God should abhor them.

Perhaps the idea is that this psalm was specially designed to be accompanied with this instrument. The word here, Nehiloth - נחילות  nechı̂ylôth, plural. נחילה  nechı̂ylâh, singular - is supposed by Gesenius, Lexicon, to denote a flute, or pipe, as being \"perforated,\" from חלל  châlal, to bore.\" The word occurs only in this place. Very various opinions have been entertained of its meaning. See Hengstenberg, \"Com.\" The Latin Vulgate and the Septuagint understand it as meaning \"inheritance\" - the same as נחלה  nachălâh, and as being somehow designed to refer to the people of God \"as\" a heritage. Latin Vulgate: In finem pro ca, quae hereditatem consequitur, psalmus David. So the Septuagint - ὑπὲρ τῆς κληρονομούσης  huper tēs klēronomousēs. So Luther, Fur das Erbe. What was the precise idea affixed to this it is not very easy to determine. Luther explains it, \"according to the title, this is the general idea of the psalm, that the author prays for the inheritance or heritage of God, desiring that the people of God may be faithful to him, and may always adhere to him.\" The true interpretation, however, is evidently to regard this as an instrument of music, and to consider the psalm as adapted to be sung with the instrument of music specified. Why it was adapted particularly to \"that\" instrument of music cannot now be determined. Horsley renders it \"upon the flutes.\" Compare Ugolin. Thesau. Ant. Sac.; tom. xxxii. pp. 158-170.",
