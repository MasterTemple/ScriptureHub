One particularly, in whom David had reposed great confidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think it strange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while on earth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed on earth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.",

The train of thought is this: \"And I... thou upholdest me.\" Perhaps the course of expression, if it had not been suddenly changed, would have been, \"And I am sustained or held up.\" The thought, however, turns rather on God than on himself, and instead of carrying out the reference to himself so prominently, he turns to God as the source from where all this was derived.",
