Have not we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his bread daily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not take pleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the making vain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy, personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not take constant care of us, we should not be upheld.

The Latin Vulgate renders it in a similar manner: Verbum iniquitum constituerunt adversum me. Luther: \"They have formed a wicked device (Bubenstuck) against me;\" they behave in a knavish or wicked manner. DeWette, \"Destruction (Verderben) or punishnnent (Strafe) is poured upon him.\" The term rendered \"disease\" means properly \"word\" or \"thing;\" and Prof. Alexander renders it, \"A word of Belial is poured upon him.\" The word rendered \"evil, Belial,\" means literally \"without use\" - בליעל  belı̂ya‛al - from בלי  belı̂y, \"not or without,\" and יעל  ya‛al, \"use or profit.\"",
