One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of God on them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is a tempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his people for his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful nature and love to his people, makes him change the course of justice into mercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case is awful when the outward church is considered. When nations professing Christianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord brings them low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance, there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalm concludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people, and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people of the earth, ere long, add their Amen.",

It was not by any native tenderness on the part of the pagan; it was not because they were disposed of themselves to show them any favor; it was not because they had any \"natural\" relentings on the subject; but it was because God had access to their hearts, and \"inclined\" them to show compassion for their suffering prisoners. This is a remarkable instance of the power of God over even the hardened minds and hearts of pagan men; and it shows that he holds this power, and can exercise it when he pleases. If he could excite in their hard hearts feelings of compassion toward his own people in bondage, what should prevent his having such access to the hearts of the pagan now as to lead them to repentance toward himself? On the exercise of this power the salvation of the pagan world - as of all sinners - must depend; and for the putting forth of this power we should most fervently pray. The \"literal\" rendering of this verse would be, \"And he gave them to compassions before all those that made them captive.\" That is, he inclined them to show favor or compassion. Compare ",
