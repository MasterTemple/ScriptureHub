We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and then complain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against bad men do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be to the Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, that is, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices, but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission to his will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men think it below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws of justice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion.Barnes' Notes on the BibleHe lieth in wait secretly - Margin, in the secret places. See the note at Psalm 10:8. The object here is merely to illustrate the thought in the previous verse, by an allusion to a lion and a hunter.As a lion in his den - As a lion crouches down in his den, ready to spring upon his prey. That is, the lion is concealed, but is on the look out, and when his prey passes near his den, he suddenly springs upon it and secures it. So it is with the wicked man. He carefully lays his plans. He conceals his purposes. He is himself hidden, or his plans are all hidden. Suddenly he springs upon his victim, who is taken by surprise and has no power of defense or escape. The purpose here is not so much to describe the wicked man as a literal robber, as to compare the conduct of the wicked with that of a robber - one who, like a lion or a hunter, lies concealed until his victim is seen. This will describe the conduct of a large class of people - men who secretly lay plans of seduction, villany, and fraud, and who spring suddenly upon their victims when there is no hope of escape.He lieth in wait to catch the poor - The helpless and defenseless.He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net - As a hunter does the wild beast. Here the same thought is presented under a new image - that of a hunter. He lays his snare, gin, or pit-fall, and when the animal is allured into it, he springs the net suddenly on him, or the animal sinks into the pit, and is secured. See the note at Psalm 7:15; the note at Psalm 9:15. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary8. eyes … privily—He watches with half-closed eyes, appearing not to see.Matthew Poole's Commentary As a lion in his den,  where he lurks and waits for prey. He doth catch,  or snatch, or seize upon, to wit, with violence, and to devour or destroy him. When he draweth him;  or, by drawing him; or, after he hath drawn him. He layeth snares for him, and when he takes him, tears him in pieces. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleHe lieth in wait secretly as a lion,.... The first beast in Revelation 13:2; is said to have a mouth like a lion, and the second beast in Psalm 10:11; spake like a dragon; and both design one and the same, antichrist, in his twofold capacity, civil and ecclesiastical; this metaphor of the lion lying in wait secretly for his prey denotes the insidious methods used by antichrist to destroy the faithful witnesses of Christ; who lies like a lion in his den, in the temple of God, now become a den of thieves; he lieth in wait to catch the poor: to snatch and carry them away captive as his prey; see Revelation 13:10; he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net; this metaphor is taken from fowlers, who spread nets, into which they allure and draw the birds and catch them. The allurements, snares, and nets, which antichrist lays to catch the poor saints and people of God in, are the riches and honours of this world, great pretensions to holiness, devotion; and religion, and many lying signs and wonders. Geneva Study BibleHe lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.",
