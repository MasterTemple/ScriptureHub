Yet for our sakes, submitting to be charged as guilty, he suffered all evils, but, being innocent, he triumphed over them all. The plea is, For the righteous God trieth the hearts and the reins. He knows the secret wickedness of the wicked, and how to bring it to an end; he is witness to the secret sincerity of the just, and has ways of establishing it. When a man has made peace with God about all his sins, upon the terms of grace and mercy, through the sacrifice of the Mediator, he may, in comparison with his enemies, appeal to God's justice to decide.",

And he might call him Cush. partly by a tacit allusion to his father’s name Kish, and partly with respect to his black and wicked disposition planted and firmly rooted in him. Compare Jeremiah 13:23 Amos 9:7. Or, 2. Some eminent and potent commander or courtier under Saul called Cush, though he be not elsewhere named; it being the lot of many other persons to be named but once in Scripture. And he is called the Benjamite, because he was one of that tribe, in which Saul put most confidence. See 1 Samuel 22:7. The psalmist prayeth for deliverance from his persecuting enemies, Psalm 7:1,2, and maketh a solemn profession of his innocency, Psalm 7:3-7. By faith he seeth his defence, Psalm 7:8-11, and the destruction of his enemies, Psalm 7:12-17.
