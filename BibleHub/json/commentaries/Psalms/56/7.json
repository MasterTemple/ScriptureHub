His enemies were too hard for him, if God did not help him. He resolves to make God's promises the matter of his praises, and so we have reason to make them. As we must not trust an arm of flesh when engaged for us, so we must not be afraid of an arm of flesh when stretched out against us. The sin of sinners will never be their security.

The Septuagint renders it, \"As I have suffered this for my life, thou wilt on no account save them.\" Luther, \"What they have done evil, that is already forgiven.\" DeWette reads it, as in our translation, as a question: \"Shall their deliverance be in wickedness?\" Probably this is the true idea. The psalmist asks with earnestness and amazement whether, under the divine administration, people \"can\" find safety in mere wickedness; whether great crimes constitute an evidence of security; whether his enemies owed their apparent safety to the fact that they were so eminently wicked. He prays, therefore, that God would interfere, and show that this was not, and could not be so.",

There is no allusion to the little complimentary lachrymatories of fashionable and fanciful Romans, it is a robuster metaphor by far; such floods of tears had David wept that a leathern bottle would scarce hold them. He trusts that the Lord will be so considerate of his tears as to store them up as men do the juice of the vine, and he hopes that the place of storage will be a special one - \"thy bottle,\" not a bottle. \"Are they not in thy book?\" Yes, they are recorded there, but let not only the record but the grief itself be present to thee.
