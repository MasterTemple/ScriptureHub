He is a Help, a present Help, a Help found, one whom we have found to be so; a Help at hand, one that is always near; we cannot desire a better, nor shall we ever find the like in any creature. Let those be troubled at the troubling of the waters, who build their confidence on a floating foundation; but let not those be alarmed who are led to the Rock, and there find firm footing. Here is joy to the church, even in sorrowful times. The river alludes to the graces and consolations of the Holy Spirit, which flow through every part of the church, and through God's sacred ordinances, gladdening the heart of every believer. It is promised that the church shall not be moved. If God be in our hearts, by his word dwelling richly in us, we shall be established, we shall be helped; let us trust and not be afraid.",

The next words are a necessary inference from these. \"Will not we fear.\" With God on our side, how irrational would fear be! Where he is all power is, and all love, why therefore should we quail? \"Though the earth be removed,\" though the basis of all visible things should be so convulsed as to be entirely changed. \"And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;\" though the firmest of created objects should fall to headlong ruin, and be submerged in utter destruction. The two phrases set forth the most terrible commotions within the range of imagination, and include the overthrow of dynasties, the destruction of nations, the ruin of families, the persecutions of the church, the reign of heresy, and whatever else may at any time try the faith of believers. Let the worst come to the worst, the child of God should never give way to mistrust; since God remaineth faithful there can be no danger to his cause or people. When the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the heavens and the earth shall pass away in the last general conflagration, we shall serenely behold \"the wreck of matter, and the crash of worlds,\" for even then our refuge shall preserve us from all evil, our strength shall prepare us for all good.",

Evil may ferment, wrath may boil, and pride may foam, but the brave heart of holy confidence trembles not.
