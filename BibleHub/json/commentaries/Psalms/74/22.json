This is probably correct, since לחיּת נפשׁ, \"to the eager wild beast,\" this inversion of the well-known expression נפשׁ חיּה, which on the contrary yields the sense of vita animae, is an improbable and exampleless expression. If נפשׁ were intended to be thus understood, the poet might have written אל־תתן לנפשׁ חיּה תורך, \"give not Thy turtle-dove over to the desire of the wild beast.\" Hupfeld thinks that the \"old, stupid reading\" may be set right at one stroke, inasmuch as he reads אל תתן לנפש חית תורך, and renders it \"give not to rage the life Thy turtle-dove;\" but where is any support to be found for this לנפשׁ, \"to rage,\" or rather (Psychology, S. 202; tr. p. 239) \"to eager desire?\" The word cannot signify this in such an isolated position.
