JEHOVAH, for that is the name here used, is not to be worshipped with groans and cries, but with thanks, for he is good; and these thanks should be heartily rendered, for his is no common goodness: he is good by nature, and essence, and proven to be good in all the acts of his eternity. Compared with him there is none good, no, not one: but he is essentially, perpetually, superlatively, infinitely good. We are the perpetual partakers of his goodness, and therefore ought above all his creatures to magnify his name. Our praise should be increased by the fact that the divine goodness is not a transient thing, but in the attribute of mercy abides for ever the same, \"for his mercy endureth for ever.\" The word endureth has been properly supplied by the translators, but yet it somewhat restricts the sense, which will be better seen if we read it, \"for his mercy for ever.\" That mercy had no beginning, and shall never know an end. Our sin required that goodness should display itself to us in the form of mercy, and it has done so, and will do so evermore; let us not be slack in praising the goodness which thus adapts itself to our fallen nature.",

But withal he takes notice also of God’s judgments upon wicked persons and people. And by this representation of God’s mercies and judgments, he invites all nations to an acknowledgment of the true God, to praise him for his favours, and to tremble at his judgments, which is their just duty and reasonable service. An exhortation to the redeemed to praise and celebrate the Lord, and to observe his manifold providences, Psalm 107:1-3; to strangers and captives, Psalm 107:4-16; to sick, and sea-men, Psalm 107:17-32; and to all others, commending them that carefully observe this, Psalm 107:33-43.  This whole verse occurs also Psalm 106:1; only there the address is made to the Israelites, and here to all mankind. ",
