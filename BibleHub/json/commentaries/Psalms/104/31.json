As the fat of the sacrifice was the Lord's portion, so are our best meditations due to the Most High and are most acceptable to him. We ought, therefore, both for our own good and for the Lord's honour to be much occupied with meditation, and that meditation should chiefly dwell upon the Lord himself: it should be \"meditation of him.\" For want of it much communion is lost and much happiness is missed. \"I will be glad in, the Lord.\" To the meditative mind every thought of God is full of joy.
