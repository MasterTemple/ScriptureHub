Here is praise of the ministry and people of Thyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. They grew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire that their last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived at some wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and by this upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts of men, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement is given to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerous to despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of which those who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is of his faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what is for their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering, victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their power and dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord and Saviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against the enemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.",

With that particle omitted the passage will read, as rendered by Prof. Stuart, \"But I say unto you, the remainder in Thyatira, so many as hold not this doctrine,\" etc. That is, he addresses now all the members of the church who were not involved in the charges already made.

There are doctrines of error, and arguments for sin, to originate which seems to lie beyond the power of people, and which would appear almost to have exhausted the talent of Satan himself. They evince such a profound knowledge of man; of the divine government; of the course of events on earth; and of what our race needs; and they are defended with so much eloquence, skill, learning, and subtlety of argumentation, that they appear to lie beyond the compass of the human powers.",

A somewhat more natural interpretation, it seems to me, however, is to refer it to what the opposers of these heretics said of these errors. They called them \"the depths of Satan,\" and they professed not to have known anything of them. The meaning, perhaps, would be expressed by the familiar words, \"as they say,\" or \"as they call them,\" in the following manner: \"As many as have not known the depths of Satan, as they say,\" or, \"to use their own language.\" Doddridge paraphrases it, \"as they proverbially speak.\" Tyndale encloses it in a parenthesis.",

Under any circumstances the church must suffer. It would suffer in reputation. It would suffer in respect to its internal tranquility.

It appears from Irenaeus that the Gnostics of his time talked of “the deep things of Depth” as well as “the deep things of God.” It is curious that the phrase “the depths of knowledge” is quoted from the great Ephesian philosopher Heraclitus: possibly it was owing to his influence, that such notions found a congenial home in Asia Minor.",

Thus in Hebrews 12:1, \"lay aside every weight (ὄγκος),\" the figure being that of runners in the race-course, and the word appropriate as denoting the bulky robes and the accoutrements of the ordinary dress which might impede the freedom of the limbs. In Matthew 20:12, \"the burden (βάρος) and heat of the day,\" the idea is that of heavy toil pressing like a weight. So Galatians 6:2, \"Bear ye one another's burdens.\" But in Galatians 6:5, the emphasis is on the act of bearing; and therefore φορτίον is used: \"Every man shall bear his own burden;\" i.e., every man shall carry that which it is appointed him to bear. The reference in that passage is probably to the prohibition enjoined by the apostolic council of Jerusalem, which concerned the very things which are rebuked here - fornication and abstinence from idol-meats. In the narrative of that council the phrase occurs \"to lay upon you no greater burden\" (Acts 15:28). The meaning accordingly will be, \"I put upon you no other burden than abstinence from and protest against these abominations.\" ",
