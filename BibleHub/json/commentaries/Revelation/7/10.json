And he questions whether the praises of the church on earth can answer this prophetic description, or the intention of the prophetic Spirit, in the great encouragement it designed to give to faithfulness and constancy. He thinks, to understand it of the heavenly church, is a natural sense of the expressions, and a sense proper to the design of the prophecy, as it represents the faithful martyrs and confessors, once so great sufferers on earth, now blessed saints in heaven.

This will undoubtedly be the song of the released forever, and all who reach the heavenly world will feel that they owe their deliverance from eternal death, and their admission to glory, wholly to him. Prof. Robinson (Lexicon) renders the word \"victory\" here. The fair meaning is, that whatever is included in the word \"salvation\" will be due to God alone - the deliverance from sin, danger, and death; the triumph over every foe; the resurrection from the grave; the rescue from eternal burnings; the admission to a holy heaven - victory in all that that word implies will be due to God.",
