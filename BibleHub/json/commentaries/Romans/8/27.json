        "text": "Note, (1) Are believers \"led by the Spirit of God\" (Ro 8:14)? How careful then should they be not to \"grieve the Holy Spirit of God\" (Eph 4:30)! Compare Ps 32:8, 9: \"I will … guide thee with Mine eye. Be not (then) as the horse, or as the mule,\" &c. (2) \"The spirit of bondage,\" to which many Protestants are \"all their lifetime subject,\" and the \"doubtsome faith\" which the Popish Church systematically inculcates, are both rebuked here, being in direct and painful contrast to that \"spirit of adoption,\" and that witness of the Spirit, along with our own spirit, to the fact of our sonship, which it is here said the children of God, as such, enjoy (Ro 8:15, 16). (3) As suffering with Christ is the ordained preparation for participating in this glory, so the insignificance of the one as compared with the other cannot fail to lighten the sense of it, however bitter and protracted (Ro 8:17, 18). (4) It cannot but swell the heart of every intelligent Christian to think that if external nature has been mysteriously affected for evil by the fall of man, it only awaits his completed recovery, at the resurrection, to experience a corresponding emancipation from its blighted condition into undecaying life and unfading beauty (Ro 8:19-23). (5) It is not when believers, through sinful \"quenching of the Spirit,\" have the fewest and faintest glimpses of heaven, that they sigh most fervently to be there; but, on the contrary, when through the unobstructed working of the Spirit in their hearts, \"the first-fruits\" of the glory to be revealed are most largely and frequently tasted, then, and just for that reason, is it that they \"groan within themselves\" for full redemption (Ro 8:23). For thus they reason: If such be the drops, what will the ocean be? If thus \"to see through a glass darkly\" be so very sweet, what will it be to \"see face to face?\" If when \"my Beloved stands behind our wall, looking forth at the windows, showing Himself through the lattice\" (So 2:9)—that thin veil which parts the seen from the unseen—if He is even thus to me \"Fairer than the children of men,\" what shall He be when He stands confessed before my undazzled vision, the Only-begotten of the Father in my own nature, and I shall be like Him, for I shall see Him as He is? (6) \"The patience of hope\" (1Th 1:3) is the fitting attitude for those who with the joyful consciousness that they are already \"saved\" (2Ti 1:9; Tit 3:5), have yet the painful consciousness that they are saved but in part: or, \"that being justified by His grace, they are made (in the present state) heirs according to the hope (only) of eternal life,\" Tit 3:7 (Ro 8:24, 25). (7) As prayer is the breath of the spiritual life, and the believer's only effectual relief under the \"infirmity\" which attaches to his whole condition here below, how cheering is it to be assured that the blessed Spirit, cognizant of it all, comes in aid of it all; and in particular, that when believers, unable to articulate their case before God, can at times do nothing but lie \"groaning\" before the Lord, these inarticulate groanings are the Spirit's own vehicle for conveying into \"the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth\" their whole case; and come up before the Hearer of prayer as the Spirit's own intercession in their behalf, and that they are recognized by Him that sitteth on the Throne, as embodying only what His own \"will\" determined before to bestow upon them (Ro 8:26, 27)! (8) What a view do these two verses (Ro 8:26, 27) give of the relations subsisting between the Divine Persons in the economy of redemption, and the harmony of their respective operations in the case of each of the redeemed!",
