All things, all which can be the causes or means of any real good to the faithful Christian. He that has prepared a crown and a kingdom for us, will give us what we need in the way to it. Men may justify themselves, though the accusations are in full force against them; but if God justifies, that answers all. By Christ we are thus secured. By the merit of his death he paid our debt. Yea, rather that is risen again. This is convincing evidence that Divine justice was satisfied. We have such a Friend at the right hand of God; all power is given to him. He is there, making intercession. Believer! does your soul say within you, Oh that he were mine! and oh that I were his; that I could please him and live to him! Then do not toss your spirit and perplex your thoughts in fruitless, endless doubtings, but as you are convinced of ungodliness, believe on Him who justifies the ungodly. You are condemned, yet Christ is dead and risen. Flee to Him as such. God having manifested his love in giving his own Son for us, can we think that any thing should turn aside or do away that love? Troubles neither cause nor show any abatement of his love. Whatever believers may be separated from, enough remains. None can take Christ from the believer: none can take the believer from Him; and that is enough. All other hazards signify nothing. Alas, poor sinners! though you abound with the possessions of this world, what vain things are they! Can you say of any of them, Who shall separate us? You may be removed from pleasant dwellings, and friends, and estates. You may even live to see and seek your parting. At last you must part, for you must die. Then farewell, all this world accounts most valuable. And what hast thou left, poor soul, who hast not Christ, but that which thou wouldest gladly part with, and canst not; the condemning guilt of all thy sins! But the soul that is in Christ, when other things are pulled away, cleaves to Christ, and these separations pain him not. Yea, when death comes, that breaks all other unions, even that of the soul and body, it carries the believer's soul into the nearest union with its beloved Lord Jesus, and the full enjoyment of him for ever.",

(2) How ennobling is the thought that the complicated movements of the divine government of the world are all arranged in expressed furtherance of the \"good\" of God's chosen (Ro 8:28)! (3) To whatever conformity to the Son of God in dignity and glory, believers are or shall hereafter be raised, it will be the joy of everyone of them, as it is most fitting, \"that in all things He should have the pre-eminence\" (Col 1:18), (Ro 8:29). (4) \"As there is a beautiful harmony and necessary connection between the several doctrines of grace, so must there be a like harmony in the character of the Christian. He cannot experience the joy and confidence flowing from his election without the humility which\" the consideration of its being gratuitous must produce; nor can he have the peace of one who is justified without the holiness of one who is saved\" (Ro 8:29, 30) [Hodge]. (5) However difficult it may be for finite minds to comprehend the emotions of the Divine Mind, let us never for a moment doubt that in \"not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up for us all,\" God made a real sacrifice of all that was dearest to His heart, and that in so doing He meant for ever to assure His people that all other things which they need—inasmuch as they are nothing to this stupendous gift, and indeed but the necessary sequel of it—will in due time be forthcoming (Ro 8:32). (6) In return for such a sacrifice on God's part, what can be considered too great on ours? (7) If there could be any doubt as to the meaning of the all-important word \"Justification\" in this Epistle—whether, as the Church of Rome teaches, and many others affirm, it means \"infusing righteousness into the unholy, so as to make them righteous,\" or, according to Protestant teaching, \"absolving, acquitting, or pronouncing righteous the guilty\" Ro 8:33 ought to set such doubt entirely at rest. For the apostle's question in this verse is, \"Who shall bring a charge against God's elect?\" In other words, \"Who shall pronounce\" or \"hold them guilty?\" seeing that \"God justifies\" them: showing beyond all doubt, that to \"justify\" was intended to express precisely the opposite of \"holding guilty\"; and consequently (as Calvin triumphantly argues) that it means \"to absolve from the charge of guilt.\" (8) If there could be any reasonable doubt in what light the death of Christ is to be regarded in this Epistle, Ro 8:34 ought to set that doubt entirely at rest. For there the apostle's question is, Who shall \"condemn\" God's elect, since \"Christ died\" for them; showing beyond all doubt (as Philippi justly argues) that it was the expiatory (character of that death which the apostle had in view). (9) What an affecting view of the love of Christ does it give us to learn that His greatest nearness to God and most powerful interest with Him—as \"seated on His right hand\"—is employed in behalf of His people here below (Ro 8:34)! (10) \"The whole universe, with all that it contains, so far as it is good, is the friend and ally of the Christian; and, so far as it is evil, is more than a conquered foe\" (Ro 8:35-39) [Hodge]. (11) Are we who \"have tasted that the Lord is gracious,\" both \"kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation\" (1Pe 1:5), and embraced in the arms of Invincible Love? Then surely, while \"building ourselves up on our most holy faith,\" and \"praying in the Holy Ghost,\" only the more should we feel constrained to \"keep ourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life\" (Jude 20, 21).
