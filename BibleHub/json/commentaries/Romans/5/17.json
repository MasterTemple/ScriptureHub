This free gift did not place them anew in a state of trial, but fixed them in a state of justification, as Adam would have been placed, had he stood. Notwithstanding the differences, there is a striking similarity. As by the offence of one, sin and death prevailed to the condemnation of all men, so by the righteousness of one, grace prevailed to the justification of all related to Christ by faith. Through the grace of God, the gift by grace has abounded to many through Christ; yet multitudes choose to remain under the dominion of sin and death, rather than to apply for the blessings of the reign of grace.

Here, for the first time in this section, he speaks of that LIFE which springs out of justification, in contrast with the death which springs from sin and follows condemnation. The proper idea of it therefore is, \"Right to live\"—\"Righteous life\"—life possessed and enjoyed with the good will, and in conformity with the eternal law, of \"Him that sitteth on the Throne\"; life therefore in its widest sense—life in the whole man and throughout the whole duration of human existence, the life of blissful and loving relationship to God in soul and body, for ever and ever. It is worthy of note, too, that while he says death \"reigned over\" us through Adam, he does not say Life \"reigns over us\" through Christ; lest he should seem to invest this new life with the very attribute of death—that of fell and malignant tyranny, of which we were the hapless victims. Nor does he say Life reigns in us, which would have been a scriptural enough idea; but, which is much more pregnant, \"We shall reign in life.\" While freedom and might are implied in the figure of \"reigning,\" \"life\" is represented as the glorious territory or atmosphere of that reign. And by recurring to the idea of Ro 5:16, as to the \"many offenses\" whose complete pardon shows \"the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness,\" the whole statement is to this effect: \"If one man's one offense let loose against us the tyrant power of Death, to hold us as its victims in helpless bondage, 'much more,' when we stand forth enriched with God's 'abounding grace' and in the beauty of a complete absolution from countless offenses, shall we expatiate in a life divinely owned and legally secured, 'reigning' in exultant freedom and unchallenged might, through that other matchless 'One,' Jesus Christ!\" (On the import of the future tense in this last clause, see on [2198]Ro 5:19, and [2199]Ro 6:5).",
