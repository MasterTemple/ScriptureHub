Thus Aeschylus, \"Agamemnon,\" 390-393: Paris, subjected to the judgment of men, tested (δικαιωθεὶς) is compared to bad brass which turns black when subjected to friction.

Thus Herodotus, i., 100: \"Deioces the Mede, if he heard of any act of oppression, sent for the guilty party and punished him according to his offense.\" Compare Plato, \"Laws,\" ii., 934.
