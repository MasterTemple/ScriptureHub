The corrupt nature, though weakened, is not eradicated, and too frequently occasions such mournful falls, as leave little doubt concerning its existence and power. Mr. Scott seems to have felt this difficulty, for, having explained the phrase of \"separation from iniquity, as a dead man ceases from the actions of life,\" he immediately adds, \"not only ought this to be the believer's character, but in a measure it actually is so.\" It is not probable. however, that the apostle meant by the strong expression under discussion, that believers were not altogether \"dead to sin,\" but only in a measure.",
