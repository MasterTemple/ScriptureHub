Being made free from the reign of sin, alive unto God, and having the prospect of eternal life, it becomes believers to be greatly concerned to advance thereto. But, as unholy lusts are not quite rooted out in this life, it must be the care of the Christian to resist their motions, earnestly striving, that, through Divine grace, they may not prevail in this mortal state. Let the thought that this state will soon be at an end, encourage the true Christian, as to the motions of lusts, which so often perplex and distress him. Let us present all our powers to God, as weapons or tools ready for the warfare, and work of righteousness, in his service. There is strength in the covenant of grace for us. Sin shall not have dominion. God's promises to us are more powerful and effectual for mortifying sin, than our promises to God. Sin may struggle in a real believer, and create him a great deal of trouble, but it shall not have dominion; it may vex him, but it shall not rule over him. Shall any take occasion from this encouraging doctrine to allow themselves in the practice of any sin? Far be such abominable thoughts, so contrary to the perfections of God, and the design of his gospel, so opposed to being under grace. What can be a stronger motive against sin than the love of Christ? Shall we sin against so much goodness, and such love?",

And as all power to obey can reach the sinner only through Grace, of which the law knows nothing, it follows that to be \"under the law\" is, finally, to be shut up under an inability to keep it, and consequently to be the helpless slave of sin. On the other hand, to be \"under grace,\" is to be under the glorious canopy and saving effects of that \"grace which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\" (see on [2205]Ro 5:20, 21). The curse of the law has been completely lifted from off them; they are made \"the righteousness of God in Him\"; and they are \"alive unto God through Jesus Christ.\" So that, as when they were \"under the law,\" Sin could not but have dominion over them, so now that they are \"under grace,\" Sin cannot but be subdued under them.

Hence, in ver. 15 at least, a different aspect of the difference between being under law and being under grace seems evidently to come in; namely, this - that the principle of law is to exact complete obedience to its behests; but the principle of grace is to accept faith in lieu of complete obedience.

He allows the first of the expositions of it given above to be \"una quae caeteris prohabilius sustineri queat.\" But he thinks that ver. 15, following, requires the other, and he concludes thus: \"Vult enim nos consolari apostolus, ne animis fatiscamus in studio bene agendi, propterea quod multas imperfectiones adhuc in nobis sentiamus. Uteunque enim peccati aculeis vexemut, non petest tamen nos subigere, quia Spiritu Dei superiores reddimur: deinde in gratia constituti, sumus liberati a rigida Legis exactione.\" It may be that the apostle, when he wrote ver. 14, meant what the previous context suggests, but passed on in ver. 15 to the other idea in view of the way in which his words might be understood. In what follows next (vers. 15-23) is introduced the second illustration (see former note), drawn from the human relations between masters and slaves.
