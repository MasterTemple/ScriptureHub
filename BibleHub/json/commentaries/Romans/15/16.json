The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness.

Paul here retains the \"language,\" though without affirming or implying that the ministers of the New Testament were literally \"priests\" to offer sacrifice. The word used here occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Its meaning here is to be determined from the connection. The question is, What is the \"sacrifice\" of which he speaks? It is the \"offering up\" - the sacrifice of the Gentiles. The Jewish sacrifices were abolished. The Messiah had fulfilled the design of their appointment, and they were to be done away. (See the Epistle to the Hebrews.) There was to be no further \"literal\" sacrifice. But now the \"offerings\" of the Gentiles were to be as acceptable as had been the offerings of the Jews. God made no distinction; and in speaking of these offerings, Paul used \"figurative\" language drawn from the Jewish rites. But assuredly he did not mean that the offerings of the Gentiles were \"literal\" sacrifices to expiate sins; nor did he mean that there was to be an order of men who were to be called \"priests\" under the New Testament. If this passage \"did\" prove that, it would prove that it should be confined to the \"apostles,\" for it is of them only that he uses it. The meaning is this: \"Acting in the Christian church substantially as the priests did among the Jews; that is, endeavoring to secure the acceptableness of the offerings which the Gentiles make to God.\"",
