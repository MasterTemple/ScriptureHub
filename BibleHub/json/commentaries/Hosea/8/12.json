Man seems by the temples he builds to be mindful of his Maker, yet really he has forgotten him, because he has cast off all his fear; but none ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. So long as men despise the truths and precepts of God's word, and the ordinances of his worship, all the observances and offerings, however costly, of their own devising, will be unto them for sin; for those services only are acceptable to God, which are done according to his word, and through Jesus Christ.",

He wrote those manifold things \"to them\" (or \"for them\") by Moses, not for that time only, but that they might be continually before their eyes, as if He were still writing. He had written to them since, in their histories, in the Psalms. His words were still sounding in their ears through the teaching of the prophets. God did not only give His law or revelation once for all, and so leave it. By His providence and by His ministers He continually renewed the knowledge of it, so that those who ignored it, should have no excuse. This ever-renewed agency of God He expresses by the word, \"I write,\" what in substance was long ago written. What God then wrote, were \"the great things of His law\" (as the converted Jews, on the day of Pentecost speak of \"the great\" or \"wonderful things of God\" ) or \"the manifold things of His law,\" as the Apostle speaks of \"the manifold wisdom of God\" ",
