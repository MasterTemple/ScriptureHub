They take a course by themselves, and like a wild ass by himself, they will be the easier and surer prey for the lion. Man is in nothing more like the wild ass's colt, than in seeking for that succour and that satisfaction in the creature, which are to be had in God only.

Yea, though they sue among the nations, now will I gather them, and they will begin to diminish on account of the burden of the king of the princes.\" Going to Assyria is defined still further in the third clause as suing for loves, i.e., for the favour and help of the Assyrians. The folly of this suing is shown in the clause, \"wild ass goes by itself alone,\" the meaning and object of which have been quite mistaken by those who supply a כ simil. For neither by connecting it with the preceding words thus, \"Israel went to Asshur, like a stubborn ass going by itself\" (Ewald), nor by attaching to it those which follow, \"like a wild ass going alone, Ephraim sued for loves,\" do we get any suitable point of comparison. The thought is rather this: whilst even a wild ass, that stupid animal, keeps by itself to maintain its independence, Ephraim tries to form unnatural alliances with the nations of the world, that is to say, alliances that are quite incompatible with its vocation.
