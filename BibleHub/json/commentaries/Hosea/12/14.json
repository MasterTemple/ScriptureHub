Ephraim has stirred up bitter wrath; and his Lord will leave his blood upon him, and turn back his shame upon him.\" In order to show the people still more impressively what great things the Lord had done for them, the prophet recals the flight of Jacob, the tribe-father, to Mesopotamia, and how he was obliged to serve many years there for a wife, and to guard cattle; whereas God had redeemed Israel out of the Egyptian bondage, and had faithfully guarded it through a prophet. The flight of Jacob to Aramaea, and his servitude there, are mentioned not \"to give prominence to his zeal for the blessing of the birthright, and his obedience to the commandment of God and his parents\" (Cyr., Theod., Th. v. Mops.); nor \"to bring out the double servitude of Israel - the first the one which the people had to endure in their forefather, the second the one which they had to endure themselves in Egypt\" (Umbreit); nor \"to lay stress upon the manifestation of the divine care towards Jacob as well as towards the people of Israel\" (Ewald); for there is nothing at all about this in ",
