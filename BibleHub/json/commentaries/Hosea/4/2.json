It is far more forcible than if he had said, \"They swear, lie, kill, and steal.\" It expresses that these sins were continual, that nothing else (so to speak) was going on; that it was all one scene of such sins, one course of them, and of nothing besides; as we say more familiarly, \"It was all, swearing, lying, killing, stealing, committing adultery.\" It is as if the prophet, seeing with a sight above nature, a vision from God, saw, as in a picture, what was going on, all around, within and without, and summed up in this brief picture, all which he saw. This it was and nothing but this, which met his eyes, wherever he looked, whatever he heard, \"swearing, lying, killing, stealing, committing adultery.\" The prophet had before said, that the ten tribes were utterly lacking in all truth, all love, all knowledge of God. But where there are none of these, \"there,\" in all activity, will be the contrary vices. When the land or the soul is empty of the good, it will be full of the evil. \"They break out,\" i. e., burst through all bounds, set to restrain them, as a river bursts its banks and overspreads all things or sweeps all before it. \"And blood toucheth blood,\" literally, \"bloods touch bloods\" .
