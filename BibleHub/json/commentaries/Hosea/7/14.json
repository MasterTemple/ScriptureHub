The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves. Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within us.",

In place of the public prayer and humiliation, there was a mere tumultuous assembly, in which they clamored \"for grain and wine,\" and \"rebelled against God. They assemble themselves;\" (literally, \"they  gather themselves tumultuously together). They rebel against Me ;\" (literally, \"they turn aside against Me\"). They did not only (as it is expressed elsewhere) \"turn aside \"from\" God.\" \"They turn aside against Me,\" He says, flying, as it were, in the very face of God.
