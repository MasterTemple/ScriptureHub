The actual wickedness of men's lives bears a very small proportion to what is in their hearts. But when lust is inwardly cherished, it will break forth into outward sin. Those who tempt others to drunkenness never can be their real friends, and often design their ruin. Thus men execute the Divine vengeance on each other.

Then he enumerates their wickedness: \"The thief cometh in (indoors stealthily), and the troop of robbers spoileth without\" (out-of-doors with open violence).Israel reproved for manifold sins, Hosea 7:1-10. God’s wrath against them for their hypocrisy, Hosea 7:11-16.

I would have healed Israel: God doth assume the person of a physician or chirurgeon, who compassionately endeavours to cure a people sick and wounded: such was the house of Israel, the whole body of the people. The iniquity;  the hidden, old, and putrefying sores, here called iniquity, the impieties and injustice. Of Ephraim;  of Israel, called Ephraim, or of Ephraim, the chief tribe of this revolting kingdom; some would have it mean the rulers, or principal men.

The wickedness, the great and many sins of Samaria,  the royal city of the kingdom, where citizens, priests, prophets, and courtiers as much outsinned others as they exceeded them in wealth and ease. They commit falsehood;  lying and cozening each other is acted as if it were a business they were bound to attend. The thief cometh in;  secret thefts, or robbing others by subtle and undiscerned methods. The troop of robbers spoileth without;  and open violence by hands joined to hands to spoil abroad.

The words contain no threatening of punishment, but a picture of the moral corruption that had become incurable. Here again Ephraim is not the particular tribe, but is synonymous with Israel, the people or kingdom of the ten tribes; and Samaria is especially mentioned in connection with it, as the capital and principal seat of the corruption of morals, just as Judah and Jerusalem are frequently classed together by the prophets.

Sheqer, lying, i.e., deception both in word and deed towards God and man, theft and highway robbery and not fear of the vengeance of God. \"Accedit ad haec facinora securitas eorum ineffabilis\" (Marck).
