            "text": "For the multitude of thine iniquity and the great hatred - The words stand at the close of the verse, as the reason of all which had gone before. Their \"manifold iniquity\" and their \"great hatred\" of God were the ground why the \"days of visitation\" and \"recompense\" should \"come.\" They were the ground also, why God allowed such prophets to delude them. The words, \"the great hatred,\" stand quite undefined, so that they may signify alike the hatred of Ephraim against God and good people and His true prophets, or God's hatred of them. Yet it, most likely, means, \"their\" great hatred, since of them the prophet uses it again in the next verse. The sinner first neglects God; then, as the will of God is brought before him, he willfully disobeys Him; then, when, he finds God's will irreconcilably at variance with his own, or when God chastens him, he hates Him, and (the prophet speaks out plainly) \"hates\" Him \"greatly.\" ",
