No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests. Abused goodness calls for greater severity.",

Israel never so flourished, as under Jeroboam II. Bright and glistening with light is \"the early dew;\" in an hour it is gone, as if it had never been. Glowing and gilded by the sun is \"the morning cloud;\" while you admire its beauty, its hues have vanished. \"The chaff\" lay in one heap \"on the floor\" with the wheat. Its owner casts the mingled chaff and wheat against the strong wind; in a moment, it is \"driven by the wind out of the floor.\" While every gram falls to the ground, the chaff, light, dry, worthless, unsubstantial, is hurried along, unresisting, the sport of the viewless wind, and itself is soon seen no more. The \"smoke,\" one, seemingly solid, full, lofty, column, ascendeth, swelleth, welleth, vanisheth . In form, it is as solid, when about to be dispersed and seen no more, as when it first issued \"out of the chimney.\" : \"It is raised aloft, and by that very uplifting swells into a vast globe; but the larger that globe is, the emptier, for from that unsolid, unbased, inflated greatness it vanisheth in air, so that its very greatness injures it. For the more it is uplifted, extended, diffused on all sides into a larger compass, so much the poorer it becometh, and faileth, and disappeareth.\" Such was the prosperity of Ephraim, a mere show, to vanish forever. In the image of \"the chaff,\" the prophet substitutes the \"whirlwind\" for the wind by which the Easterns used to winnow, in order to picture the violence with which they should be whirled away from their own land.",

Such dew were the many prophets vouchsafed to Israel; such was Hosea himself, most brilliant, but soon to pass away.

The other two are the chaff and the smoke; the former whirled away by the storm-wind from the threshing-floor, the latter dissipated and speedily vanishing as soon as it escapes from the chimney or lattice. Such shall be the utter extermination of Israel. The senselessness of their idolatry had been treated with derision in the preceding verse; the punishment of their sin is sternly denounced in this. Kimchi comments concisely and correctly thus: \"Therefore they shall go to destruction, and shall be as the morning cloud, or as the dew speedily disappearing in the morning, width vanishes when the heat of the sun has touched it; so they shall go away speedily. So also shall they be as chaff - it is the fine particles of straw, which the wind whirls away from the threshing-floor; thus shall they be whirled away from their land.
