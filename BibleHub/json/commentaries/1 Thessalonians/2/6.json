The gospel of Christ at first met with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.",

Translate, \"when we might have borne heavily upon you,\" by pressing you with the weight of self-glorifying authority, and with the burden of our sustenance. Thus the antithesis is appropriate in the words following, \"But we were gentle (the opposite of pressing weightily) among you\" (1Th 2:7). On weight being connected with authority, compare Note, see on [2443]2Co 10:10, \"His letters are weighty\" (1Co 4:21). Alford's translation, which excludes reference to his right of claiming maintenance (\"when we might have stood on our dignity\"), seems to me disproved by 1Th 2:9, which uses the same Greek word unequivocally for \"chargeable.\" Twice he received supplies from Philippi while at Thessalonica (Php 4:16).",
