How long he might continue to hold his fellow-men in bondage, and yet be a Christian, is, however, quite a different question. It is quite clear, from the New Testament, as well as from facts now, that God may convert people when pursuing any kind of wickedness. The effect of religion, however, in all cases, will be to lead them to cease to do wrong. It is by no means improbable that many of those who had owned slaves, in accordance with the prevailing custom in the Roman empire, may have been converted - for the fact that a man has been living a life of sin does not prevent the possibility of his conversion. There is no evidence that Paul refers here to any who had bought slaves after they were converted; nor is there any intimation of any such transaction among Christians in the New Testament. Nor is there any intimation that he regarded it as right and best that they should continue to hold slaves; nor that he would approve their making arrangements to persevere in this as a permanent institution.",

This latter clause is parallel to, \"because they are brethren\"; which proves that \"they\" refers to the masters, not the servants, as Tittmann takes it, explaining the verb in the common sense (Lu 1:54; Ac 20:35), \"who sedulously labor for their (masters') benefit.\" The very term \"benefit\" delicately implies service done with the right motive, Christian \"good will\" (Eph 6:7). If the common sense of the Greek verb be urged, the sense must be, \"Because they (the masters) are faithful and beloved who are sedulously intent on the benefiting\" of their servants. But Porphyry [On Abstinence, 1.46] justifies the sense of the Greek verb given above, which also better accords with the context; for otherwise, the article \"the,\" will have nothing in the preceding words to explain it, whereas in my explanation above \"the benefit\" will be that of the slaves' service.",
