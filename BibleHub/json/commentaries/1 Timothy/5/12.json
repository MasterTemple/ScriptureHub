The widow-presbyteresses, moreover, engaged to remain single, not as though single life were holier than married life (according to Rome's teaching), but because the interests of Christ's cause made it desirable (see on [2480]1Ti 3:2). They had pledged \"their first faith\" to Christ as presbyteress widows; they now wish to transfer their faith to a husband (compare 1Co 7:32, 34).",
