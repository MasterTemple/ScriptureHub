The entire series of doctrines respecting the authority of the Pope, purgatory, the mass, the invocation of the saints, the veneration of relics, the seven sacraments, the authority of tradition, the doctrine of merit, etc., is regarded as false. Indeed, the system could not be better characterized than by saying that it is a system \"speaking lies.\" The entire scheme attempts to palm falsehood upon the world, in the place of the simple teaching of the New Testament. The only question is, whether this is done \"in hypocrisy,\" or hypocritically. In regard to this, it is not necessary to maintain that there is \"no\" sincerity among the ministers of that communion, or that \"all\" are hypocritical in their belief and their teaching.

But they are now committed. They have devoted their lives to this profession. They are trained now to this system of imposture, and they must continue to practice and perpetuate the fraud, or abandon the church, and subject themselves to all the civil and ecclesiastical disabilities which would now follow if they were to leave and reveal all its frauds and impostures. A gentleman of high authority, and who has had as good an opportunity as any man living to make accurate and extensive observations, stated to me, that this was a common thing in regard to the Catholic clergy in France and Italy.

Theodoret explains like English Version, \"seared,\" as implying their extreme insensibility; the effect of cauterizing being to deaden sensation. The Greek, however, primarily means \"branded\" with the consciousness of crimes committed against their better knowledge and conscience, like so many scars burnt in by a branding iron: Compare Tit 1:15; 3:11, \"condemned of himself.\" They are conscious of the brand within, and yet with a hypocritical show of sanctity, they strive to seduce others.
