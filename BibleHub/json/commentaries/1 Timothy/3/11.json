For there is no reason that special rules should be laid down as to the wives of the deacons, and not also as to the wives of the bishops or overseers. Moreover, if the wives of the deacons were meant, there seems no reason for the omission of \"their\" (not in the Greek). Also the Greek for \"even so\" (the same as for \"likewise,\" 1Ti 3:8, and \"in like manner,\" 1Ti 2:9), denotes a transition to another class of persons. Further, there were doubtless deaconesses at Ephesus, such as Phœbe was at Cenchrea (Ro 16:1, \"servant,\" Greek, \"deaconess\"), yet no mention is made of them in this Epistle if not here; whereas, supposing them to be meant here, the third chapter embraces in due proportion all the persons in the service of the Church. Naturally after specifying the qualifications of the deacon, Paul passes to those of the kindred office, the deaconess. \"Grave\" occurs in the case of both. \"Not slanderers\" here, answers to \"not double-tongued\" in the deacons; so \"not false accusers\" (Tit 2:3). \"Sober\" here answers to \"not given to much wine,\" in the case of the deacons (1Ti 3:8). Thus it appears he requires the same qualifications in female deacons as in deacons, only with such modifications as the difference of sex suggested. Pliny, in his celebrated letter to Trajan, calls them \"female ministers.\"",
