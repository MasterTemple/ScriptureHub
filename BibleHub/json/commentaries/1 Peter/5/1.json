He does not speak of three \"orders,\" of \"bishops, priests, and deacons;\" and the evidence from the passage here is quite strong that there were no such orders in the churches of Asia Minor, to which this Epistle was directed. It is also worthy of remark, that the word \"exhort\" is here used. The language which Peter uses is not that of stern and arbitrary command; it is that of kind and mild Christian exhortation.

He does not put it on the ground of his apostolical authority; or urge it because he was the vicegerent of Christ; or because he was the head of the church; or because he had any pre-eminence over others in any way. Would he have used this language if he had been the \"head of the church\" on earth? Would he if he supposed that the distinction between apostles and other ministers was to be perpetuated?
