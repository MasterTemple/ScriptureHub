J. H. Michaelis (after the Targ. and Syr.) has properly rendered the clause: \"stulti tollunt ignominiam tanquam portionem suam,\" adding \"quae derivato nomine תרומה dicitur.\" הרים signifies, in the language of the sacrificial worship and of worship generally, to lift off from anything the best portion, the legitimate portion due to God and the priesthood (vid., at Proverbs 3:9); for which reason Rashi glosses מרים by מפרישׁ לו, and Ralbag by מגביה לו. See Proverbs 14:29. Honour is that which the wise inherit, it falls to them unsought as a possession, but fools receive shame as the offal (viz., of their foolish conduct). The fut. and part. are significantly interchanged. The life of the wise ends in glory, but fools inherit shame; the fruit of their conduct is shame and evermore shame. ",
