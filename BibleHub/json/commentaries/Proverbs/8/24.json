Genesis 7:11 with Genesis 49:25). נכבּדּי־מים(abounding with water) is a descriptive epitheton to מעינות, which, notwithstanding its fem. plur., is construed as masc. (cf. Proverbs 5:16). The Masora does not distinguish the thrice-occurring נכבדי according to its form as written (Isaiah 23:8-9). The form נכבּדּי (which, like בּתּים, would demand Metheg) is to be rejected; it is everywhere to be written נכבּדּי nettirw  (Ewald, 214b) with Pathach, with Dagesh following; vid., Kimchi, Michlol 61b. Kimchi adds the gloss מעיני מים רבים, which the Gr. Venet., in accordance with the meaning of נכבד elsewhere, renders by πηγαῖς δεδοξασμένων ὑδάτων (as also Bttcher: the most honoured  equals  the most lordly); but Meri, Immanuel, and others rightly judge that the adjective is here to be understood after Genesis 13:2; Job 14:21 (but in this latter passage כבד does not mean \"to be numerous\"): loaded  equals  endowed in rich measure.",
