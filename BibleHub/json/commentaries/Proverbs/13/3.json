Many a one is ruined by an ungoverned tongue. 4. The slothful desire the gains the diligent get, but hate the pains the diligent take; therefore they have nothing. This is especially true as to the soul. 5. Where sin reigns, the man is loathsome. If his conscience were awake, he would abhor himself, and repent in dust and ashes.",

The Vulgate paraphrases, \"He who is inconsiderate in speech shall experience evils;\" Septuagint, \"will terrify himself\" - will occasion to himself many terrible alarms and inflictions. Hence the psalmist prays, \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my month; keep the door of my lips.\" So we have in the Danish, \"A silent man's words are not brought into court;\" and in the Spanish, \"Let not the tongue say what the head shall pay for;\" while the Italians tell us, \"The sheep that bleats is strangled by the wolf:\" and \"Silence was never written down\" (Kelly).
