In this age Adrianus also was bishop of Corinth, he flourished under Mauritius the emperor; as likewise did Anastasius archbishop of the Corinthians; and he being removed from his office, John succeeded him in it; in the \"seventh\" century there was a Corinthian bishop in the sixth council at Constantinople (p); thus far this ancient church is to be traced in history.
