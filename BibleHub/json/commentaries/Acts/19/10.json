The growth of the new community among both sections of the population became a conspicuous fact, and began to tell upon the number of pilgrims who brought their offerings to the shrine of Artemis, or carried away memorials from it.",

See on [2058]2Co 1:15, 16, which might seem inconsistent with this. The passage across was quite a short one (see on [2059]Ac 18:19)—Towards the close of this long stay at Ephesus, as we learn from 1Co 16:8, he wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians; also (though on this opinions are divided) the Epistle to the Galatians. (See [2060]Introduction to First Corinthians, and [2061]Introduction to Galatians).

And thus Ephesus became the \"ecclesiastical center for the entire region, as indeed it remained for a very long period\" [Baumgarten]. Churches arose at Colosse, Laodicea, and Hierapolis eastward, either through his own labors or those of his faithful helpers whom he sent out in different directions, Epaphras, Archippus, Philemon (Col 1:7; 4:12-17; Phm 23).",
