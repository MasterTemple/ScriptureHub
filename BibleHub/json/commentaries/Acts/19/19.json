Where there is true sorrow for sin, there will be free confession of sin to God in every prayer and to man whom we have offended, when the case requires it. Surely if the word of God prevailed among us, many lewd, infidel, and wicked books would be burned by their possessors. Will not these Ephesian converts rise up in judgement against professors, who traffic in such works for the sake of gain, or allow themselves to possess them?

The word used here (περίεργα  perierga) denotes properly \"those things that require care or skill,\" and was thus applied to the arts of \"magic, jugglery, and sleight of hand\" that were practiced so extensively in Eastern countries. That such arts were practiced at Ephesus is well known. The Ephesian letters, by which incantations and charms were supposed to be produced, were much celebrated. They seem to have consisted of certain combinations of letters or words, which, by being pronounced with certain intonations of voice, were believed to be effectual in expelling diseases, or evil spirits; or which, by being written on parchment and worn, were supposed to operate as amulets, or charms, to guard from evil spirits or from danger. Thus, Plutarch (Sympos., 7) says, \"The magicians compel those who are possessed with a demon to recite and pronounce the Ephesian letters, in a certain order, by themselves.\" Thus, Clemens Alex. (Strom. ii.) says, \"Androcydes, a Pythagorean, says that the letters which are called Ephesian, and which are so celebrated, are symbols, etc.\" Erasmus says (Adagg. Cent., 2) that there were certain marks and magical words among the Ephesians, by using which they succeeded in every undertaking. Eustath. a.d. Homer, Odyssey τ, says \"that those letters were incantations which Croesus used when on the funeral pile, and which greatly befriended him.\" He adds that, in the war between the Milesians and Ephesians, the latter were thirteen times saved from ruin by the use of these letters.
