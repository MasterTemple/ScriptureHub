But after His resurrection, as if to signify the new relation in which He now stood to the Church, He signalized His first meeting with the assembled disciples by breathing on them (immediately after dispensing to them His peace) and saying, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost\" (Joh 20:22) thus anticipating the donation of the Spirit from His hands (see on [1930]Joh 20:21, 22); and on the same principle His parting charges are here said to have been given \"through the Holy Ghost,\" as if to mark that He was now all redolent with the Spirit; that what had been husbanded, during His suffering work, for His own necessary uses, had now been set free, was already overflowing from Himself to His disciples, and needed but His ascension and glorification to flow all forth.
