Moreover, though the two names, Barnabas and Barsabas, differ little in sound, yet much in sense: the former is interpreted \"the son of consolation\", Acts 4:36 but the latter signifies much the same with Bathsheba; as that may be interpreted \"the daughter\", this \"the son of an oath\"; or as others, \"a son of wisdom\"; and by others, \"the son of fulness\"; I should choose to take it to be the same name with , and interpret it, \"the son of an old man\"; as Alphaeus might be, when Joses, or Joseph was born, and he be the younger brother of James and Jude; as for his surname Justus, this was a name not only in use among the Grecians and Romans, especially the latter, but among the Jews: hence we often read of Rabbi  \"Justa\", and sometimes,  \"Justi\", and at other times, \"Justai\" (x) whether he had this surname from his being a very just man, as Aristides was called Aristides the just; and so Simeon the high priest, the last of Ezra's great synagogue, was called Simeon the just (y); and so James the brother of this Joseph, or Joses, was called by the Jews (z); and it may be, that he himself might have his name from the patriarch Joseph, who used to be called by them, Joseph,  \"the just\" (a): for Matthias, his name is Jewish, and he was no doubt a Jew; hence we read , \"Rabbi Matthia ben Charash\" (b); his name signifying the same as Nathanael does, namely, the gift of God, made Dr. Lightfoot conjecture they might be the same; but this agrees not with another conjecture that learned man, who elsewhere thinks, that Bartholomew and Nathanael were the same; and if so, he must have been an apostle already; Clemens of Alexandria was of opinion, that this Matthias was Zacchaeus (c), ",
