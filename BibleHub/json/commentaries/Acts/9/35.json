When we were wholly without strength, as this poor man, he sent his word to heal us. Peter does not pretend to heal by any power of his own, but directs Eneas to look up to Christ for help. Let none say, that because it is Christ, who, by the power of his grace, works all our works in us, therefore we have no work, no duty to do; for though Jesus Christ makes thee whole, yet thou must arise, and use the power he gives thee.",

It was such a fruitful and delightful country, that the Targum on Sol 2:1 has rendered it by the garden of Eden: it had its name either from  \"Shur\", which signifies to behold afar off, from the fine and large prospect that might be taken on it; or from \"Shar\", which signifies the navel, because it was a valley or plain surrounded on every side with mountains and hills: it abounded in flowers and fruits; hence mention is made of the rose of Sharon, Sol 2:1 and in vines; hence we frequently read of the wine of Saron (r), and which was so very good, that they mixed two parts of water with one of wine (s).
