This is one among many instances, Where wicked and unprincipled people will endeavor to make religion the means of promoting their own interest. If they can make money by it, they will become its professed friends or if they can annoy Christians, they will at once have remarkable zeal for the laws and for the purity of religion.

It was on this account that Socrates was condemned, and the Chaldeans or Jews were banished from the city.\" Cicero (\"DeLegibus,\" ii. 8) says, \"No person shall have any separate gods, or new ones; nor shall he privately worship any strange gods, unless they be publicly allowed.\" Wetstein (in loco) says, \"The Romans would indeed allow foreigners to worship their own god, but not unless it were done secretly, so that the Worship of foreign gods would not interfere with the allowed worship of the Romans, and so that occasion for dissension and controversy might be avoided. Neither was it lawful among the Romans to recommend a new religion to the citizens, contrary to what was confirmed and established by the public authority, and to call off the people from that. It was on this account that there was such a hatred of the Romans against the Jews\" (Kuinoel). Tertullian says that \"there was a decree that no god should be consecrated unless approved by the senate\" (Grotius).

Poppaea, Nero's consort, was their patroness, and Seneca said, \"the Jewish faith is now received on every hand. The conquered have given laws to the conquerors.\" On the other hand, there were laws which forbade the introduction of strange deities among the Romans themselves. In 186 b.c., when stringent measures were taken by the government for the repression of Bacchanalian orgies in Rome, one of the consuls, addressing an assembly of the people, said: \"How often in the ages of our fathers was it given in charge to the magistrates to prohibit the performance of any foreign religious rites; to banish strolling sacrificers and soothsayers from the forum, the circus, and the city; to search for and burn books of divination; and to abolish every mode of sacrificing that was not conformable to the Roman practice\" (Livy, xxxix., 16). It was contrary to strict Roman law for the Jews to propagate their opinions among the Romans, though they might make proselytes of other nations. ",
