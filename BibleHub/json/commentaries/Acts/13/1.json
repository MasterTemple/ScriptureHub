Prophets and teachers;  these two offices might be in the same person, as he that had the gift of prophecy, and could foretell things to come, might be a teacher to instruct the people; but yet they were frequently appertaining to several persons, one excelling in one gift, another in another. Simeon that was called Niger;  this Simeon is thus distinguished from Simon Peter, and from Simon the Canaanite, this name of Niger being given him by the Romans. Lucius;  this hath been thought the name of Luke, it being more after the Latin termination; and that it might be he that wrote the Gospel called by his name, and this book of the Acts. However, we meet with this name, Romans 16:21; and St. Paul sends salutation unto him that was so called. Of Cyrene;  born at a place so called, or brought up in the synagogue of the Cyrenians; of which, Acts 6:9. Either this Manaen was Herod’s foster brother, or had the same tutors and instructors with him, their education being together. This Herod was Herod Antipas, who set at nought our Saviour, and killed the Baptist. And yet Manaen, as another Moses, kept his integrity in that Pharaoh’s court; and, as Moses, he choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season,  Hebrews 11:25. Thus there was an Obadiah in Ahab’s house, 1 Kings 18:3, and divers believe in Nero’s family, Philippians 4:22. ",
