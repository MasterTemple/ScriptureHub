Under the direct influence of the Holy Ghost, he gave Elymas his true character, but not in passion. A fulness of deceit and mischief together, make a man indeed a child of the devil. And those who are enemies to the doctrine of Jesus, are enemies to all righteousness; for in it all righteousness is fulfilled. The ways of the Lord Jesus are the only right ways to heaven and happiness. There are many who not only wander from these ways themselves, but set others against these ways. They commonly are so hardened, that they will not cease to do evil. The proconsul was astonished at the force of the doctrine upon his own heart and conscience, and at the power of God by which it was confirmed. The doctrine of Christ astonishes; and the more we know of it, the more reason we shall see to wonder at it. Those who put their hand to the plough and look back, are not fit for the kingdom of God. Those who are not prepared to face opposition, and to endure hardship, are not fitted for the work of the ministry.",

The temple of Venus remained in this place in the \"second\" century; and in the \"fourth\" century Venus was worshipped here; yet in the beginning of the \"fourth\" century, in the council of Nice, Cyril, bishop of Paphos, was present; and in the \"fifth\" century, a bishop of this place was at the synod of Chalcedon: and in the \"eighth\" century, Michael, bishop of Taphos, was in the Nycene synod (w).
