He was, indeed, a \"servant\" δοῦλος  doulos - of Philemon, but would the apostle have addressed the Colossians, and said that he was \"one of them,\" if he had occupied precisely the condition which is now denoted by the word \"slave\"? Would a minister of the gospel now in the Northern States, who should send a letter by a run-away slave to a community of masters at the South, say of him that he was \"one of them?\" Would it be kindly received, or produce a good impression, if he did? There is reason, therefore, to think that Onesimus was not a slave in the proper sense, but that he might have been a respectable youth, who had bound himself to service for a term of years; compare Plm 1:18.",
