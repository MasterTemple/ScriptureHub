If he were disposed to earn his own living, he would not need the labor of slaves.

That this verse doth refer to the foregoing chapter, and that it was unadvisedly divided from it, is generally agreed. Masters: having put servants upon their duty, he doth here engage all those who have a just right over servants to mind their own duty toward those under their command. Give unto your servants that which is just;  though your extract or estate hath advanced you above them in human society, yet yoa have the same nature and infirmities that they have, and (as in the foregoing verse) must appear with them before the same Judge and rewarder at the same tribunal. And the apostle doth elsewhere, Ephesians 6:9, require of masters in their superior relation, what he doth of servants in their inferior one, to do the same things,  i.e. not the particular offices of their servants, but, according to general rules of right reason, that which, by the law of God, nature, and nations, is common to and incumbent on all relatives, Romans 13:7,8 Ga 5:13 Ephesians 6:9. As he doth here require masters to do their servants right, give to them that which is their due for soul and body, Genesis 18:19 Exodus 12:44; with respect to work, that it be neither too much nor too little, Proverbs 12:10 29:21; to food, that it be convenient for nourishment, not luxury, Proverbs 27:27 31:15 Luke 12:42 15:17; wages, Exodus 2:21 Jam 5:4; and recompence, Deu 15:13. And equal;  ye are likewise to give them that which is equal, or equitable, as well as just, which implies you should not be cruel to them, or discourage them; as you expect they should serve you with good will, so you should govern them wisely, and be good and gentle to them, Psalm 101:2 1 Peter 2:18, who are faithful, allowing them seasonable rest and refreshment, Deu 15:14, not despising their prudent answers, Job 31:13,14, but showing them favour in sickness as well as in health, 2 Kings 5:5,6 Pr 14:35 Matthew 8:6. Knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven;  and that upon this weighty reason, intimated before, that he above, whom you serve, will treat you as you do them; this you may be assured of, Ephesians 6:8,9. If you expect favour at his hands, when he comes to distribute rewards and punishments, show it now to your inferiors, who will then appear as your fellow servants, when you must give an account of your stewardship, Matthew 24:49-51, with Luke 16:2.
