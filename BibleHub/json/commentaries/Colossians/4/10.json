The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much.

He, together with Gaius, had been seized in the tumult at Ephesus and treated with violence, but he adhered to the apostle in all his troubles, and attended him all his perils.

He was now at Rome with Paul (compare Phm 23, 24). As he is here spoken of as Paul's \"fellow prisoner,\" but in Phm 24 as Paul's \"fellow laborer\"; and vice versa, Epaphras in Phm 23, as his \"fellow prisoner,\" but here (Col 1:7) \"fellow servant,\" Meyer in Alford, conjectures that Paul's friends voluntarily shared his imprisonment by turns, Aristarchus being his fellow prisoner when he wrote to the Colossians, Epaphras when he wrote to Philemon. The Greek for \"fellow prisoner\" is literally, fellow captive, an image from prisoners taken in warfare, Christians being \"fellow soldiers\" (Php 2:25; Phm 2), whose warfare is \"the good fight of faith.\"",

The family belonged to Cyprus (Ac 4:36); this accounts for Barnabas' choice of Cyprus as the first station on their journey (Ac 13:4), and for Mark's accompanying them readily so far, it being the country of his family; and for Paul's rejecting him at the second journey for not having gone further than Perga, in Pamphylia, but having gone thence home to his mother at Jerusalem (Mt 10:37) on the first journey (Ac 13:13).",

Thus (Phm 19), \"I have written,\" for \"I write.\" The substance of them was, \"If he come unto you, receive him.\" Paul's rejection of him on his second missionary journey, because he had turned back at Perga on the first journey (Ac 13:13; 15:37-39), had caused an alienation between himself and Barnabas. Christian love soon healed the breach; for here he implies his restored confidence in Mark, makes honorable allusion to Barnabas, and desires that those at Colosse who had regarded Mark in consequence of that past error with suspicion, should now \"receive\" him with kindness. Colosse is only about one hundred ten miles from Perga, and less than twenty from the confines of Pisidia, through which province Paul and Barnabas preached on their return during the same journey. Hence, though Paul had not personally visited the Colossian Church, they knew of the past unfaithfulness of Mark; and needed this recommendation of him, after the temporary cloud on him, so as to receive him, now that he was about to visit them as an evangelist. Again, in Paul's last imprisonment, he, for the last time, speaks of Mark (2Ti 4:11).",
