Regarding the explanation of Rosenmller, audiverunt quidem amici mei, a me implorati Lamentations 1:19, quod gemens ego...imo sunt omnes hostes mei, Thenius observes that it introduces too much. This remark is still more applicable to his own interpretation: \"People (certainly) hear how I sigh, (yet) I have no comforter.\" The antithesis introduced by the insertion of \"yet\" destroys the simplicity of arrangement among the clauses, although C. B. Michaelis and Gerlach also explain the passage in the same manner. The subject of the words, \"they have heard,\" in the first clause, is not the friends who are said in Lamentations 1:19 to have been called upon for help, nor those designated in the second clause of Lamentations 1:21 as \"all mine enemies,\" but persons unnamed, who are only characterized in the second clause as enemies, because they rejoice over the calamity which they have heard of as having befallen Jerusalem. The first clause forms the medium of transition from the faithless friends (Lamentations 1:19) to the open enemies (Lamentations 1:21); hence the subject is left undefined, so that one may think of friends and enemies. The foes rejoice that God has brought the evil on her. The words 'הבאת וגו, which follow, cannot also be dependent on כּי (\"that Thou hast brought the day which Thou hast announced\"), inasmuch as the last clause, \"and they shall be like me,\" does not harmonize with them. Indeed, Ngelsbach and Gerlach, who assume that this is the connection of the clause \"Thou hast brought,\" etc., take 'ויהיוּ כ adversatively: \"but they shall be like me.\" If, however, \"they shall be,\" etc., were intended to form an antithesis to \"all mine enemies have heard,\" etc., the former clause would be introduced by והם. The mere change of tense is insufficient to prove the point. It must further be borne in mind, that in such a case there would be introduced by the words \"and they shall be,\" etc., a new series of ideas, the second great division of the prayer; but this is opposed by the arrangement of the clauses. The second portion of the prayer cannot be attached to the end of the verse. The new series of thoughts begins rather with \"Thou hast brought,\" which the Syriac has rendered by the imperative, venire fac. Similarly Luther translates: \"then (therefore) let the day come.\" C. B. Michaelis, Rosenmller, Pareau, etc., also take the words optatively, referring to the Arabic idiom, according to which a wish is expressed in a vivid manner by the perfect. This optative use of the perfect certainly cannot be shown to exist in the Hebrew; but perhaps it may be employed to mark what is viewed as certain to follow, in which case the Germans use the present. The use of the perfect shows that the occurrence expected is regarded as so certain to happen, that it is represented as if it had already taken place. The perfects in Lamentations 3:56-61 are taken in this sense by nearly all expositors. Similarly we take the clause now before us to mean, \"Thou bringest on the day which Thou hast proclaimed (announced),\" i.e., the day of judgment on the nations, Jeremiah 25, \"so that they become like me,\" i.e., so that the foes who rejoice over my misfortune suffer the same fate as myself. \"The day [which] Thou hast proclaimed\" has been to specifically rendered in the Vulgate, adduxisti diem consolationis, probably with a reference of the proclamation to Isaiah 40:2. - After this expression of certainty regarding the coming of a day of punishment for her enemies, there follows, Lamentations 1:22, the request that all the evil they have done to Jerusalem may come before the face of God, in order that He may punish it (cf. Psalm 109:15 with Lamentations 1:14), - do to them as He has done to Jerusalem, because of her transgressions. The clause which assigns the reason (\"for many are my sighs,\" etc.) does not refer to that which immediately precedes; for neither the request that retribution should be taken, nor the confession of guilt (\"for all my transgressions\"), can be accounted fore by pointing to the deep misery of Jerusalem, inasmuch as her sighing and sickness are not brought on her by her enemies, but are the result of the sufferings ordained by God regarding her. The words contain the ground of the request that God would look on the misery (Lamentations 1:20), and show to the wretched one the compassion which men refuse her. לבּי  is exactly the same expression as that in Jeremiah 8:18; cf. also Isaiah 1:5. The reason thus given for making the entreaty forms an abrupt termination, and with these words the sound of lamentation dies away. ",
