This self-encouragement begins with Lamentations 3:22, inasmuch as the prophet strengthens his hope by a consideration of the infinite compassion of the Lord. (It is) חסדי, \"the mercies of God,\" i.e., proofs of His mercy (cf. Psalm 89:2; Psalm 107:43; Isaiah 63:7), \"that we are not utterly consumed,\" as Luther and similarly our English translators have excellently rendered תּמנוּ.

The proofs of the grace of God have their foundation in His compassion, from which they flow. In Lamentations 3:23 we take חסדי  as the subject of חדשׁים; it is the proofs of the grace of God that are new every morning, not \"His compassions,\" although the idea remains the same. לבּקרים, every morning, as in Isaiah 33:2; Psalm 73:14. Ubi sol et dies oritur, simul et radii hujus inexhaustae bonitatis erumpunt (Tarnovius in Rosenmller).
