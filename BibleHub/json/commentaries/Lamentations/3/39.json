The verse is viewed in a different light by Pareau, Ewald, Neumann, and Gerlach, who combine both members into one sentence, and render it thus: \"Why doth a man complain, so long as he lives, - a man over the punishment of his sins?\" [Similar is the rendering of our \"Authorized\" Version.] Neumann translates: \"A man in the face of [Ger. bei] his sins.\" But this latter rendering is lexically inadmissible, because על esua in this connection cannot mean \"in view of.\" The other meaning assigned is improbable, though there is nothing against it, lexically considered. For though חטא, sin, may also signify the punishment of sin, the latter meaning does not suit the present context, because in what precedes it is not said that the people suffer for their sins, but merely that their suffering has been appointed by God.
