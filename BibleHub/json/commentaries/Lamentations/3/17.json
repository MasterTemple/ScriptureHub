This addition does not permit of our attaching a transitive sense to תּזנח, for the verb means to despise, not to reject; hence we cannot render the words, \"Thou didst reject my soul from peace.\" The meaning of the clause is not \"my soul loathes prosperity,\" as it is rendered by Thenius, who further gives the sense as follows: \"I had such a thorough disgust for life, that I had no longer the least desire for prosperity.\" As Gerlach has already remarked, this explanation neither harmonizes with the meaning of שׁלום, not with the expression of doubt in the following verse, which implies a very lively \"sense of the prosperous;\" moreover, it has no good lexical basis.

The complainant in his thoughts has gone far from God, and is on the very verge of despair. But here also begins the turning-point. When for the first time he utters the name of God in the expression \"my hope from Jahveh,\" he shows that Jahveh is to him also still the ground of hope and trust. Hence also he not merely complains, \"my strength is gone,\" etc., but introduces this thought with the words ואמר, \"I said,\" sc. in my heart, i.e., I thought, \"my strength is gone, and my hope from Jahveh lost,\" i.e., vanished. The mention of the name Jahveh, i.e., the Covenant-God, keeps him from sinking into despair, and urges him not to let go his trust on the Lord, so that he can now (in what follows) complain to the Lord of his state of distress, and beseech His help.",
