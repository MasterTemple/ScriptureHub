The horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem are again described. Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church of old, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bring down the church now.

Jeremiah 37:10; Jeremiah 51:4). 'מתּנוּבות שׁ does not mean \"of the fruits,\" but מן is a brief expression for \"because there are no fruits,\" i.e., from want of the produce of the field; cf. בּשׂרי , \"my flesh wastes away from oil,\" i.e., because there is a want of oil, Psalm 109:24. There was thus no need for the conjecture מתּלאבות, \"from burning glow,\" from drought, which has been proposed by Ewald in order to obtain the following sense, after supplying כּ: \"as if melting away through the drought of the field, emaciated by the glowing heat of the sun.\" The free rendering of the Vulgate, consumpti a sterilitate terrae, gives no support to the conjecture.LinksLamentations 4:9 InterlinearLamentations 4:9 Parallel TextsLamentations 4:9 NIVLamentations 4:9 NLTLamentations 4:9 ESVLamentations 4:9 NASBLamentations 4:9 KJVLamentations 4:9 Bible AppsLamentations 4:9 ParallelLamentations 4:9 Biblia ParalelaLamentations 4:9 Chinese BibleLamentations 4:9 French BibleLamentations 4:9 German BibleBible Hub",
