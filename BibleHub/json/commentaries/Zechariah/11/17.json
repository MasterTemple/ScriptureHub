The idol shepherd has the garb and appearance of a shepherd, receives submission, and is supported at much expense; but he leaves the flock to perish through neglect, or leads them to ruin by his example. This suits many in different churches and nations, but the warning had an awful fulfilment in the Jewish teachers.

The \"idol shepherd that leaveth the flock\" cannot apply to Rome, but to some ruler among the Jews themselves, at first cajoling, then \"leaving\" them, nay, destroying them (Da 9:27; 11:30-38). God's sword shall descend on his \"arm,\" the instrument of his tyranny towards the sheep (2Th 2:8); and on his \"right eye,\" wherewith he ought to have watched the sheep (Joh 10:12, 13). However, Antichrist shall destroy, rather than \"leave the flock.\" Perhaps, therefore, the reference is to the shepherds who left the flock to Antichrist's rapacity, and who, in just retribution, shall feel his \"sword\" on their \"arm,\" which ought to have protected the flock but did not, and on their \"eye,\" which had failed duly to watch the sheep from hurt.

Not indeed by driving them along bad and stony roads (Tarn., Ewald, Hitzig), for this does no great harm to sheep, but so that when he consumes the sheep, he even splits or tears in pieces the claws, to seize upon the swallow the last morsel of flesh of fat. But this tyrant will also receive his punishment for doing so. The judgment which is to fall upon him is set forth in accordance with the figure of the shepherd, as punishment through the loss of the arm and of the right eye.

The sword is called to come upon the arm and the right eye of the worthless shepherd, i.e., to hew off his arm, to smite his right eye. The further threat that the arm is to wither, the eye to become extinct, does not appear to harmonize with this. But the sword is simply mentioned as the instrument of punishment, and the connecting together of different kinds of punishment simply serves to exhibit the greatness and terrible nature of the punishment. With this threat, the threatening word concerning the imperial power of the world (ch. 9-11) is very appropriately brought to a close, inasmuch as the prophecy thereby returns to its starting-point.
