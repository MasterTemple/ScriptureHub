Three reasons why they must be silent are implied: (1) they are but \"flesh,\" weak and ignorant; (2) He is Jehovah, all-wise and all-powerful; (3) He is already \"raised up out of His place,\" and who can stand before Him?

But the call to all to \"be silent\" is rather when God has come forth from heaven where so long He has dwelt unseen, and is about to inflict vengeance on the foe, before taking up His dwelling in Zion and the temple. However, Ps 50:1, 2 (\"Out of Zion\"), Ps 50:3 (compare Hab 2:3), Ps 50:4, favors Calvin's view. God is now \"silent\" while the Gentile foe speaks arrogance against His people; but \"our God shall come and no longer keep silence\"; then in turn must all flesh \"be silent\" before Him.   ",
