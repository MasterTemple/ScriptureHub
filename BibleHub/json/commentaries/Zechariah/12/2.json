Such an invasion is also here foretold; but it is not to be expected that all the particulars of a distant prophecy should be clearly understood, before the time of its accomplishment. It is at least likely that when the time shall come for the re-establishment of the Jews, (of which sufficient intimation is given in the prophecies both of the Old and New Testaments,) and they shall begin to collect themselves, and attempt a settlement in their ancient possessions, such a measure will create jealousy and uneasiness, in those powers more especially who are interested in the dominion over those countries. The Turks, we know, are at present, and long have been, in possession of the country of Palestine; and in the opinion of many, who have brought specious arguments to justify it, particularly of the learned Joseph Mede, (p. 674 and 816,) their prince is intended by Gog, prince of Meshech and Tubal, ",

Now should that power subsist at the time, it may fairly be presumed, that he, and any other power in the like circumstances, would oppose with all their might an attempt to set up an independent sovereignty in those parts. But, without pretending to determine precisely concerning the invaders, the substance of the prophecy in this, and on to the seventh verse of the next chapter, will be found to amount to this; that Jerusalem will be besieged by a multitude of hostile nations, to the great terror of the people in its vicinity, as well as of Judah itself; but that the attempts of those nations will be frustrated through the special interposition of the Deity, and will terminate in their total discomfiture and ruin, and in the permanent peace and prosperity of the victorious Jews. After which, the Jews will be brought at length to see and lament the sin of their forefathers in putting their Messiah to death, and thereupon will have the means of purification and atonement afforded them; and, being thus cleansed from past guilt, will renounce all their former offensive practices, and carefully abstain from a future repetition of them.” To these views of Dr. Blayney, on the important subject of the restoration of the Jews to their own land, however probable upon the whole, there seems to be one great objection. Inasmuch as God cast the Jews out of their land for rejecting and crucifying the Messiah, it seems highly improbable that he should restore them to it while they remain in impenitence and unbelief, and in a state of enmity to that Messiah. It appears much more likely that, previous to their restoration, they must be made sensible of the great guilt which their nation contracted by the commission of that sin, and of the various other sins which accompanied it; and that they must be truly humbled and brought to a thorough repentance as a people, before God will open the way in any degree for their restoration. It is certain that, as they were carried captive into Babylon chiefly to punish them for the sin of idolatry, so no way was made for their restoration from that captivity, till they were generally humbled and made truly penitent for that sin.",

        "text": "Psalm 60:2 has been explained in very different ways. It is an old and widespread view, that the words \"also upon Judah will it be,\" etc., express the participation of Judah in the siege of Jerusalem. The Chaldee and Jerome both adopt this explanation, that in the siege of Jerusalem Judah will be constrained by the nations to besiege the capital of its own land. The grammatical reason assigned for this view is, that we must either take היה with על in the sense of obligation (it will also be the duty of Judah: Mich., Ros., Ewald), or supply סף־רעל as the subject to יהיה: the reeling-basin will also come upon Judah. But there is great harshness in both explanations. With the former, להלּחם, or some other infinitive, would hardly have been omitted; and with the latter, the preposition ל would stand before יהוּדה, instead of על. Moreover, in what follows there is no indication whatever of Judah's having made common cause with the enemy against Jerusalem; on the contrary, Judah and Jerusalem stand together in opposition to the nations, and the princes of Judah have strength in the inhabitants of Jerusalem (Psalm 60:5), and destroy the enemy to save Jerusalem (Psalm 60:6). Moreover, it is only by a false interpretation that any one can find a conflict between Judah and Jerusalem indicated in Zechariah 14:14. And throughout it is incorrect to designate the attitude of Judah towards Jerusalem in these verses as \"opposition,\" - a notion upon which Ebrard (Offenb. Joh.) and Kliefoth have founded the marvellous view, that by Jerusalem with its inhabitants and the house of David we are to understand the unbelieving portion of Israel; and by Judah with its princes, Christendom, or the true people of God, formed of believing Israelites, and increased by believing Gentiles. Judah is not opposed to Jerusalem, but simply distinguished from it, just as the Jewish kingdom or people is frequently designated by the prophets as Jerusalem and Judah. The גם, which does not separate, but adds, is of itself inapplicable to the idea of opposition. Consequently we should expect the words וגם על יה to express the thought, that Judah will be visited with the same fate as Jerusalem, as Luther, Calvin, and many others follow the Peshito in supposing that they do. היה על has then the meaning to happen, to come over a person; and the only question is, What are we to supply in thought as the subject? The best course is probably to take it from the previous clause, \"that which passes over Jerusalem;\" for the proposal of Koehler to supply mâtsōr as the subject is precluded by the circumstance that mâtsōr, a siege, can only affect a city or fortress (cf. Deuteronomy 20:20), and not a land. The thought is strengthened in Zechariah 12:3. Jerusalem is to become a burden-stone for all nations, which inflicts contusions and wounds upon those who try to lift it up or carry it away (\"experiencing no hurt itself, it causes great damage to them:\" Marck). The figure is founded upon the idea of the labour connected with building, and not upon the custom, which Jerome speaks of as a very common one in his time among the youth of Palestine, of testing and exercising their strength by lifting heavy stones. There is a gradation in the thought, both in the figure of the burdensome stone, which wounds whoever tries to lift it, whilst intoxicating wine only makes one powerless and incapable of any undertaking, and also in the description given of the object, viz., in Zechariah 12:2 all nations round about Jerusalem, and in Zechariah 12:3 all peoples and all nations of the earth. It is only in the last clause of Zechariah 12:3 that the oppression of Jerusalem indicated in the two figures is more minutely described, and in Zechariah 12:4 that its overthrow by the help of God is depicted. The Lord will throw the mind and spirit of the military force of the enemy into such confusion, that instead of injuring Jerusalem and Judah, it will rush forward to its own destruction. Horses and riders individualize the warlike forces of the enemy. The rider, smitten with madness, turns his sword against his own comrades in battle (cf. Zechariah 14:3; Judges 7:22; 1 Samuel 14:20). On the other hand, Jehovah will open His eyes upon Judah for its protection (1 Kings 8:29; Nehemiah 1:6; Psalm 32:8). This promise is strengthened by the repetition of the punishment to be inflicted upon the enemy. Not only with alarm, but with blindness, will the Lord smite their horses. We have an example of this in 2 Kings 6:18, where the Lord smote the enemy with blindness in answer to Elisha's prayer, i.e., with mental blindness, so that, instead of seizing the prophet, they fell into the hands of Israel. The three plagues, timmâhōn, shiggâ‛ōn, and ‛ivvârōn, are those with which rebellious Israelites are threatened in Deuteronomy 28:28. The \"house of Judah\" is the covenant nation, the population of Judah including the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as we may see from what follows. ",

            "text": " has been explained in very different ways. It is an old and widespread view, that the words \"also upon Judah will it be,\" etc., express the participation of Judah in the siege of Jerusalem. The Chaldee and Jerome both adopt this explanation, that in the siege of Jerusalem Judah will be constrained by the nations to besiege the capital of its own land. The grammatical reason assigned for this view is, that we must either take היה with על in the sense of obligation (it will also be the duty of Judah: Mich., Ros., Ewald), or supply סף־רעל as the subject to יהיה: the reeling-basin will also come upon Judah. But there is great harshness in both explanations. With the former, להלּחם, or some other infinitive, would hardly have been omitted; and with the latter, the preposition ל would stand before יהוּדה, instead of על. Moreover, in what follows there is no indication whatever of Judah's having made common cause with the enemy against Jerusalem; on the contrary, Judah and Jerusalem stand together in opposition to the nations, and the princes of Judah have strength in the inhabitants of Jerusalem (",

Joh.) and Kliefoth have founded the marvellous view, that by Jerusalem with its inhabitants and the house of David we are to understand the unbelieving portion of Israel; and by Judah with its princes, Christendom, or the true people of God, formed of believing Israelites, and increased by believing Gentiles. Judah is not opposed to Jerusalem, but simply distinguished from it, just as the Jewish kingdom or people is frequently designated by the prophets as Jerusalem and Judah. The גם, which does not separate, but adds, is of itself inapplicable to the idea of opposition. Consequently we should expect the words וגם על יה to express the thought, that Judah will be visited with the same fate as Jerusalem, as Luther, Calvin, and many others follow the Peshito in supposing that they do. היה על has then the meaning to happen, to come over a person; and the only question is, What are we to supply in thought as the subject? The best course is probably to take it from the previous clause, \"that which passes over Jerusalem;\" for the proposal of Koehler to supply mâtsōr as the subject is precluded by the circumstance that mâtsōr, a siege, can only affect a city or fortress (cf.

Jerusalem is to become a burden-stone for all nations, which inflicts contusions and wounds upon those who try to lift it up or carry it away (\"experiencing no hurt itself, it causes great damage to them:\" Marck).
