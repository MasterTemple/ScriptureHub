The Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions, read, \"fruit\", in the singular number, but other copies and versions, read, \"fruits\"; and the apostle wishes, that these saints might be \"filled\" with them; that is, that they might be like trees laden with fruit, which have fruit on every branch, bough, and twig; that they might abound in the performance of them, be ready to, and fruitful in every good work; not doing a few of one sort only, but performing continually all manner of good works; and so be like fruitful trees that yield their fruit in their season, and do not cease from so doing, but still bring forth fruit, and that in large quantities: ",
