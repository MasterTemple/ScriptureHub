In order to shame the Jews thoroughly, he shows them the faithfulness with which the Rechabites observe the ordinances of their ancestor Jonadab. The character of the address, as one intended to rouse feelings of shame, is indicated even at the beginning of Jeremiah 35:13 : \"Will ye not receive instruction by hearkening to the words of the Lord?\" The Hoph. הוּקם is construed as a passive with the accus.; in the older writers we frequently find this construction, in which the passive is used impersonally, hence the sing. is here employed: cf. Ges. 143, 1, Ew. 295, b. \"To this day\" - now for nearly 300 years without interruption; for Jonadab was already held in high esteem when Jehu ascended the throne, 883 b.c. (2 Kings 10:15). Judah, on the contrary, does not listen to the commandments which his God unceasingly inculcates on him, but rather wanders after other gods, to serve them. On Jeremiah 35:15 cf. Jeremiah 25:4-5. אל־האדמה stands for על־האדמה , Jeremiah 25:5. - In Jeremiah 35:16, where the introductory כּי, imo, indicates a culmination, the idea is once more briefly expressed. Ngelsbach incorrectly renders כּי \"because,\" and makes Jeremiah 35:16 the protasis to Jeremiah 35:17. \"Such a protasis with because (quia), without any connection with what precedes, is contrary to the use of language\" (Hitzig).
