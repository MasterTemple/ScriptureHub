Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary22.

That which is threatened is the enemies coming swiftly upon the Edomites and preying upon them, and the fear that should surprise them, which should make their hearts faint as the heart of a woman that hath a hard labour. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleBehold, he shall come up, and fly as the eagle,.... The Targum is, \"behold, as an eagle comes up and flies, so shall a king come up with his army;'' the king of Babylon with his army, compared to an eagle for his swiftness and voraciousness, as before to a lion for his strength and fierceness: and spread his wings over Bozrah; besiege that city, invest it, and seize upon it; very fitly are the wings of an army expressed by the wings of this bird, denoting both their extent and force; the same is said concerning Moab, Jeremiah 48:40; and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Moab be as the heart of a woman in her pangs; when just ready to be delivered; not only weak and timorous, but full of anguish, and: quite dispirited; See Gill on Jeremiah 48:41. Geneva Study BibleBehold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, {x} and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.(x) As Jer 48:40 was said of Moab.",
