The after-clauses, \"they will not leave,\" etc., \"they destroy,\" etc., are thus not to be taken as questions. The reference to Obadiah does not entitle us to supply הלוא from that passage. The connection here is somewhat different. The following verse is joined by means of כּי, \"for;\" and the thought, \"for I have stripped Esau, I have discovered his secret places,\" shows that the enemy is to be understood by the grape-gatherers and nocturnal thieves: he will leave nothing to glean - will plunder all the goods and treasures of Edom, even those that have been hidden.
