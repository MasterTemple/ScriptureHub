In the country itself He will hold a tribunal, and destroy king and priests out of it (Jeremiah 49:38). In Jeremiah 49:35, the bow, as the chief weapon of the Elamites (cf. Isaiah 22:6), is mentioned, by synecdoche, instead of all offensive and defensive weapons, for all the means of resistance and attack employed by this warlike nation. This, indeed, is shown by the apposition, \"the first-fruits (i.e., the chief part) of their strength\" or valour. To break the bow in pieces is thus equivalent to rendering defenceless. The plural suffix in גּבוּרתם points to Elam as a nation - the Elamites.
