The other allegation, that Jeremiah 15:13 and Jeremiah 15:14 are a quotation, corrupted in text, from Jeremiah 17:3-4, is totally without proof. In Jeremiah 17:3-4 we have simply the central thoughts of the present passage repeated, but modified to suit their new context, after the manner characteristic of Jeremiah. The genuineness of the verses is supported by the testimony of the lxx, which has them here, while it omits them in Jeremiah 17:3-4; and by the fact, that it is inconceivable they should have been interpolated as a gloss in a wholly unsuitable place.
