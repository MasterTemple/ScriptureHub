A difficult expression is קולהּ כּנּחשׁ ילך, \"her (viz., that of the daughter of Egypt) voice is like (the voice of) the serpent (which) goes.\" ילך must be taken as part of a relative sentence, since this verb is nowhere used of a voice or sound; hence it cannot be so joined here. Ewald, following the συρίζοντος of the lxx, would read שׁרק, \"hissing,\" instead of ילך, and translates, \"it makes a noise like the hissing serpent.\" He more fully defines the meaning thus: \"Even though Egypt were hidden like a serpent in a thicket, yet it would be heard in its flight, like a nasty serpent hissing fiercely, while it hurries away from the axe of the wood-cutter.\" But, apart from the arbitrary change of ילך into שׁרק (the former word is used in ",

Moreover, as Graf has already well remarked, Egypt is not compared to a serpent, but only its voice to the voice or hiss of a serpent.
