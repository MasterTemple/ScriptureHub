But whether we connect this with what precedes or what follows, we fail to obtain a fitting sense from it. Your days are full and your dispersions, for: the time is come when ye shall be slain and dispersed, cannot be maintained, because \"dispersions\" is not in keeping with \"are full.\" Again: as regards your dispersions, ye shall fall, would give a good meaning, only if \"your dispersions\" meant: the flock dispersed by the fault of the shepherds; and with this the second pers. \"ye shall fall\" does not agree.

The thought, that one part of the flock shall be slain, the other scattered, seems quite apt; so also is that which follows, that they are scattered shall fall and break like precious, i.e., fine, ornamental vases. Hence there was no occasion for Ew.'s conjectural emendation, כּכרי, like precious lambs. Nor does the lxx rendering: ἥωσπερ οἱ κριοὶ οἱ ἐκλεκτοί, give it any support; for כּרים does not mean rams, but lambs.
