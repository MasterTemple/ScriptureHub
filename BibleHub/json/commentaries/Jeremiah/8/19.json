The blood of Christ is balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient; so that the people may be healed, but will not.

Is not her king there? Why have they provoked Me to anger with their carved images, with foreign vanities?\" Their complaint, \"Is there no Jehovah in Zion?\" is met by God demanding of them the reason why instead of worshipping Him they have set up idols. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary19. The prophet in vision hears the cry of the exiled Jews, wondering that God should have delivered them up to the enemy, seeing that He is Zion's king, dwelling in her (Mic 3:11). In the latter half of the verse God replies that their own idolatry, not want of faithfulness on His part, is the cause.because of them that dwell in a far country—rather, \"from a land of distances,\" that is, a distant land (Isa 39:3). English Version understands the cry to be of the Jews in their own land, because of the enemy coming from their far-off country.strange vanities—foreign gods.Matthew Poole's Commentary The voice of the cry,  i.e. the, greatness of their cry, the bitter cries, and screeches, and complaints that methinks I hear: the words are abrupt, because the prophet is to represent several persons speaking; himself, the people, and God. Of the daughter of my people;  see Jeremiah 4:11; possibly because Jeremiah loved them, instructed them, admonished them as a daughter. Them that dwell in afar country,  viz. their enemies the Babylonians, that were to come against them from a far country, Jeremiah 6:22; or the voice of them that were captives under those of a far country; now they begin to cry, which would not be persuaded to it before: the first is most to be approved of. In Zion,  viz. in Jerusalem, a metonymy of the subject. Is not her king in her;  or, as King in Zion; or, have we not a king of the seed of David, to whom the kingdom was granted to be perpetual? Either the words of God: q. d. Was not I among you, to provide for you, and protect you, but you must needs repair to idols? The like kind of speech is in 2 Kings 1:3, and the close of the verse seems to favour this. Or, as others, an expostulatory lamentation of the people, that the cruel adversary should prevail over a people that had God so near them, Psalm 48:2,3 76:1,2: Hath God now left us? and is the promise of his continuance here at an end? Psalm 89:36-38. Why have they provoked me with strange vanities? as if God should seem to reply here, Let them not think it strange, seeing they have turned their backs upon me, and trusted to idols, which are but vanity, Jeremiah 2:11,13; called vanity, not only because idols are as nothing, but because all the confidence that is put them is vain, and because idolaters are vain in their minds, and want understanding. I have not forsaken them, but they me. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleBehold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people,.... This was what made his heart faint, such was his sympathy with his countrymen, his people in distress, whom he affectionately calls the daughter of his people, whose cry was loud, and whose voice he heard lamenting their case: because of them that dwell in a far country; because of the Chaldeans, who came from a far country; see Jeremiah 5:15 who were come into their land, and devoured it; through fear of them, and because of the devastation they made; hence the voice of their cry: or this is to be understood of the Jews in a far country, carried captive into Babylon, and the voice of their cry there, because of their captivity and oppression. So Abarbinel and the Targum, \"lo, the voice of the cry of the congregation of my people from a far country;'' and so read the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions. Is not the Lord in Zion? is not her King in her? these are the words of the people, complaining of the Lord, calling in question whether he was in Zion, and whether he was King there; and if he was, how came it to pass that he did not protect it; that he suffered the city to be taken, and the inhabitants to be carried captive? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with their strange vanities? that is, with their idols, and their idolatrous worship; this is the Lord's answer to them, giving a reason why he suffered the enemy to come in among them, and prevail over them, namely, their idolatry. It may be rendered, \"with the vanities of a stranger\" (n); of a strange people, or of a strange god.
