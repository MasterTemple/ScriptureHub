These two particles, thus used, signify \"as well as,\" \"not only...but also,\" or \"as...so.\" Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf have quite missed the meaning of both clauses, since they take חללי ישׂראל as a vocative, and render the whole thus: \"Not only must Babylon fall, O ye slain ones of Israel, but slain ones of the whole earth have fallen on the side of Babylon (or through Babylon).\" This view of the expression \"slain ones of Israel\" cannot be established, either from grammatical considerations or from a regard to the meaning of the whole. Not only is there no occasion for a direct address to the slain ones of Israel; but by such a view of the expression, the antithesis indicated by גּמרררגּם, between \"the slain ones of Israel\" and \"the slain ones of the earth,\" is thereby destroyed. Viewed grammatically, \"the slain ones of Israel\" can only be the subject dependent on the inf. לנפּל: \"the fall of the slain ones of Israel.\" Kimchi has long ago hit the meaning in the explanation, גּם בּבל היתה סבּת לנפּל, \"as Babylon was the cause of the slain ones of Israel falling.\" Similarly Jerome: et quomodo fecit Babylon ut caderent occisi ex Israel. This paraphrase may be vindicated on grammatical grounds, for the inf. constr. with ל, with or without היה, is used to express that on which one is engaged, or what one is on the point of doing; cf. Gesenius, 132, 3, Rem. 1. In this meaning, לנפּל stands here without היה: \"Just as Babylon was concerned in making the slain ones of Israel fall;\" or better: \"Just as Babylon was intent on the fall of slain ones in Israel, so also there fall because of Babylon (prop. dative, for Babylon) slain ones of all the earth;\" because there are to be found, in the capital of the empire, people from all quarters of the world, who are slain when Babylon is conquered.
