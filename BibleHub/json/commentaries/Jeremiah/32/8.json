This is not mentioned in Leviticus; hut, of course, no one would care to purchase a property till he was sure that the next kinsman would not insist on redeeming it. No one, it may be remarked, could purchase land unconditionally - the usufruct of it till the year of jubilee was all that was legally transferable; and even the original occupant had only a life interest in his land, the ownership of which was, strictly speaking, vested in the commune. This seems to Be the necessary inference from a comprehensive view of the passages relative to land in the Old Testament (see Mr. Fenton's 'Early Hebrew Life; ' and an article in the ",

Still, he had a measure of uncertainty till Hanameel actually came to him, and so demonstrated \"that this had been the word of the Lord.\" In recording the circumstances, he not unnaturally reflects his later feeling of certitude in his description of the presentiment.

But the form of expression is remarkable: \"seven shekels and ten\" instead of \"seventeen\" (שׁבעה ועשׂרת שׁקלי הכּסף). The Chaldee consequently has \"seven manehs and ten shekels of silver;\" and J. D. Michaelis supposes that the seven shekels which are first named, and are separated from the ten, were shekels of gold: \"seven shekels of gold, and seven shekels of silver.\" But both assumptions are gratuitous, and perhaps only inferences, not merely from the unusual separation of the numerals, but likewise from the fact that seventeen silver shekels (less than two pounds sterling) was too small a price for an arable field. The supposition of Hitzig has more in its favour, that the mode of expression \"seven shekels and ten (shekels) of silver\" was a law form. Some have sought to explain the smallness of the price on the ground that the seller was compelled to part with his property through poverty, and that the land had become depreciated in consequence of the war. Both may be true; but, as Ngelsbach has already remarked, neither explains the smallness of the price. For instances have very properly been adduced from Roman history (Livy, xxvi. 11, and Florus, ii. 6) which show that occupation of a country by an enemy did not lessen the value of ground-property. It is rather to be taken into consideration, that in the first place we do not know the real value of arable land among the Hebrews; and secondly, the sale of portions of land was, correctly speaking, only the sale of the harvests up till the year of jubilee, for then the property returned to the former possessor of his heirs. In the case of a sale, then, the nearer the jubilee-year, the smaller must be the price of purchase in the alienation of the land. ",
