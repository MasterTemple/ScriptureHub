Grotius translates, \"They who have been left remaining shall perish\"; they who have not been slain by the enemy shall perish by disease and famine.Matthew Poole's Commentary The prophet means such pipes as they were wont to use at funerals, and other sad occasions, to play doleful lessons upon; see Isaiah 15:5; because of the great change in the state of this poor people, which had got together a great deal of wealth, which is all perished. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleTherefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes,.... That are sounded on mournful occasions, as at funerals, and the like; see Matthew 9:23. This the prophet said, as Kimchi observes, in the person of the people, the inhabitants of Moab; whose hearts would yearn and sound for the calamities of their country like the doleful sound of minstrels. So the Targum, \"therefore the Moabites shall sound in their hearts like a harp:'' and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres; as for the country of Moab in general, so for this principal city, and the inhabitants of it, in particular; See Gill on Isaiah 16:11; because the riches that he hath gotten is perished; either Moab or Kirheres; the abundance of goods they had got together were now lost, falling into the hands of the enemy; and which was matter of lamentation. The Targum is, \"for the rest of their substance they had got were spoiled.'' Some understand it of the residue of men that escaped the sword; these perished by famine, or other means; see Isaiah 15:7. Geneva Study BibleTherefore my heart shall sound for Moab like {u} pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath gotten have perished.(u) Their custom was to play on flutes or instruments, heavy and grave tunes at burials and in the time of mourning, as in Mt 9:23.",
