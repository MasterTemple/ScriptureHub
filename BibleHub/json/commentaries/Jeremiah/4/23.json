The face of the country, in the once most fertile parts of it, now overgrown with briers and thorns, assumes the dreary wilderness of the desert.

No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls!

The answer is: as long as the people persists in the folly of its rebellion against God, so long will chastising judgments continue.
