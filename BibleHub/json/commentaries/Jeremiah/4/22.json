Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet he will not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of no avail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances would prevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are like foolish children in the concerns of their souls!

The answer is: as long as the people persists in the folly of its rebellion against God, so long will chastising judgments continue.
