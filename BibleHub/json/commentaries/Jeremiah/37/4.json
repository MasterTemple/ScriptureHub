The Jews were elated by this temporary relief, and miserably abused it Jeremiah 34:11.

Jeremiah … not put … into prison—He was no longer in the prison court, as he had been (Jer 32:2; 33:1), which passages refer to the beginning of the siege, not to the time when the Chaldeans renewed the siege, after having withdrawn for a time to meet Pharaoh.Matthew Poole's Commentary We shall read afterward, Jeremiah 37:15, that he was imprisoned; and we have heard, Jeremiah 32, of two revelations he had while he was in prison; but as yet he walked at liberty.

Was at full liberty, and could go out of the city, and come in, when he pleased; or go into any part of it, and converse with the people, and prophesy to them; which he could not do in the latter part of Jehoiakim's reign, who sent persons after him and Baruch to take them, and they were obliged to hide themselves, yea, the Lord hid them, Jeremiah 36:19; but now he was under no restraint, as least as yet: for they had not put him into prison; not yet; they afterwards did, Jeremiah 37:15.
