They forsake, forget, and fear not God, whose power is so great, Jeremiah 5:19-24. They are rich through deceit and violence; their false prophets, Jeremiah 5:25-31.  Whether this begins a new sermon, or be part of the former, is neither certain nor material; but here the prophet is called upon to go up and down, and search here and there, in every part of the city, and to make a diligent inquiry in every street and place of concourse; a phrase frequently used for searching and inquiring after a thing, Daniel 12:4 Amos 8:12; and it is spoken in the plural number, not restrained to Jeremiah in particular: q.d. Let who will search, they will find it even so. It implies the great scarcity of good men, that must be thus searched for. God gives leave to all the earth to look into the state of Jerusalem, by which he vindicates himself in the face of the whole world from all severity towards his people, whatever he brings upon them, and so stops the mouths of the Jews. Seek in the broad places;  even there, where usually is the greatest resort for merchants and merchandises, where men meet from all quarters. If ye can find a man: it seems worse than Sodom and Gomorrah, for God condescends to pardon Jerusalem if there be but one righteous man found in it; there he came no lower than ten. But it will be objected, if it be understood thus individually, What must we think of Jeremiah himself, and Baruch, and Ebed-melech, and other few, who were then, no doubt, in Jerusalem? Answ. Either he speaks of the corrupt body of the people, courtiers, priests, false prophets, not one, or scarce one among them to be found, or if any, so few as not to be discerned. A man might walk the streets of Jerusalem long enough before he could meet with any one truly religious; which universality of corruption is thus expressed in divers places, Psalm 12:1,2 14:2,3 Eze 22:30 Micah 7:1,2. Or it may be understood hyperbolically for a few. Any that executeth judgment,  i.e. among the magistracy that rightly administer justice. That seeketh the truth,  i.e. among the commonalty that deal faithfully and uprightly; it signifies, that, among them all, there are none given to it; so far from endeavouring and seeking it sincerely with their whole heart, that they are not inclined to it, but are given to oppressions, falsehoods, and deceits; they do not seek the truth. I will pardon it;  or, him; I will not destroy it for the sake of those few: the like he promiseth with reference to those five cities, Genesis 18:24, &c. ",
