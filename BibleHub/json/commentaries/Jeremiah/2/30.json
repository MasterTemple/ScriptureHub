Death was the usual fate of the true prophet Nehemiah 9:26; Matthew 23:37. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary30. (Jer 5:3; 6:29; Isa 1:5; 9:13).your children—that is, your people, you.your … sword … devoured … prophets—(2Ch 36:16; Ne 9:26; Mt 23:29, 31).Matthew Poole's Commentary Your children;  either your posterity, that you breed up like yourselves; or rather, your inhabitants in every city, they being frequently called the children of such a city, or such a place: children of Seir, 2 Chronicles 25:14, children, of the province, Ezra 2:1, and children of thy people, Leviticus 19:18, and abundance more the like; and thus it is comprehensive both of parents and children. Correction,  i.e. The fruit of correction, viz. instruction. The same word is rendered correction, Proverbs 23:13, which signifies instruction, Proverbs 5:12, and in other places; and so to be taken here: it notes their refractoriness, that though they were corrected, yet they would not be instructed; though God did smite them, yet the rod prevailed as little with them as the word. Your own sword hath devoured your prophets;  either the sword that I have sent to destroy you hath destroyed your false prophets together with you, Hosea 4:5, and so it is both a prophecy and a threatening; or rather, you have been so far from receiving counsel and instruction, that you have, by the sword, and other ways of destruction, (which is to be understood by the sword,) murdered those that I sent to reprove your follies in the days of Asa, Joash, Manasseh, &c., Nehemiah 9:26. See Matthew 23:34,35. Devoured;  or, eaten up; a metaphor. Hence we read of the edge of the sword, which both in Hebrew and Greek is called the mouth of the sword, Jeremiah 21:7 Luke 21:24. Like a destroying lion; without respect or pity; with all manner of savage usage; see Psalm 7:2; laying aside all humanity. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleIn vain have I smitten your children,.... Or, \"for vanity\" (g); for vain speaking, for making vain oaths and vows; so it is explained in the Talmud (h); but the sense is, that the rod of chastisement was used in vain; the afflictions that came upon them had no effect on them to amend and reform them; they were never the better for them: they received no correction; or instruction by them; see Jeremiah 5:3, your own sword hath devoured your prophets; as Isaiah, Zechariah, and Uriah, who were sent to them to reprove and correct them, but they were so far from receiving their correction, that they put them to death; though Kimchi mentions it as the sense of his father, and which he approves of, that this is to be understood, not of the true prophets of the Lord, but of false prophets; wherefore it is said, \"your prophets\"; and they had no prophets but false prophets, whose prophecy was the cause of the destruction of souls, and this brought ruin upon the prophets themselves; and this sense of the words Jerom gives into; it follows: like a destroying lion; that is, the sword of the Lord, according to the latter sense; the judgments of God, by which the people fall, and their false prophets with them, were like a lion that destroys and devours all that come near it. The Septuagint and Arabic versions add, and ye were not afraid; which confirms what was before said, that chastisement and correction were in vain. (g) \"propter vanitatem, sive vaniloquentiam\", Vatablus. (h) T. Bab. Sabbat, fol. 32. 2. & Cetubot, fol. 72. 1.Geneva Study BibleIn vain have I smitten your children; they have received no correction: your {r} own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.(r) That is, you have killed your prophets, that exhorted you to repentance, as Zechariah, Isaiah, etc.",

The lxx seem to have taken it thus, expression לקחוּ by ἐδέξασθε; for the third pers. of the verb will not agree with this acceptation of \"your sons,\" since the reproach of not having taken correction could not apply to such as had fallen in war, but only to those who had escaped. This view is unquestionably incorrect, because, as Hitz. admits the subject, those addressed in לקחוּ, must be the people. Hence it follows of necessity that in בּניכם too the people is meant.
