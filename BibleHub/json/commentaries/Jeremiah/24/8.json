As the evil figs — so will I give Zedekiah — Or rather, so will I make Zedekiah, as אתןshould be rendered here, and as the same verb is rendered Jeremiah 29:17. And they that dwell in the land of Egypt — Whither, it is probable, many of the Jews had fled upon the coming, or the report of the coming, of the king of Babylon: see chap. 43., 44. I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms, &c. — The Lord, by his prophet, uses the words of Moses, wherewith to express those tremendous judgments which he designed to bring upon this wicked prince and people, as well because the Jews had, or professed to have, great reverence for that man of God, how little soever they had for Jeremiah, as to let them see that what the Lord here threatened, and soon would bring to pass, was but an accomplishment of what he foretold by Moses should befall them in case of their disobedience, by which predictions they ought to have taken warning. To be a reproach, and a proverb, and a taunt —To be made a jest of and a by-word: see Daniel 9:16. And a curse in all places whither I shall drive them — Men shall use this phrase as a form of execration, “God make thee like Zedekiah, and those who remained with him;” compare Jeremiah 29:22. On the contrary, to make a man a blessing, implies that his name should be mentioned as a signal instance of God’s favour: see Genesis 48:20; Zechariah 8:13. Till they be consumed from off the land — My judgments shall follow them so closely that neither they nor any of their posterity shall ever enjoy any possession or property in their own country. This seems to be spoken of those miserable remains of the Jews who, when the rest were carried into captivity, were, either by secreting themselves, or some other means left in the desolated country. Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary24:1-10 Good and bad figs represent the Jews in captivity, and those who remain in their own land.   - The prophet saw two baskets of figs set before the temple, as offerings of first-fruits. The figs in one basket were very good, those in the other basket very bad. What creature viler than a wicked man? and what more valuable than a godly man? This vision was to raise the spirits of those gone into captivity, by assuring them of a happy return; and to humble and awaken the proud and secure spirits of those yet in Jerusalem, by assuring them of a miserable captivity. The good figs represents the pious captives. We cannot determine as to God's love or hatred by what is before us. Early suffering sometimes proves for the best. The sooner the child is corrected, the better effect the correction is likely to have. Even this captivity was for their good; and God's intentions never are in vain. By afflictions they were convinced of sin, humbled under the hand of God, weaned from the world, taught to pray, and turned from sins, particularly from idolatry. God promises that he will own them in captivity. The Lord will own those who are his, in all conditions. God assures them of his protection in trouble, and a glorious deliverance in due time. When our troubles are sanctified to us, we may be sure that they will end well. They shall return to him with their whole heart. Thus they should have liberty to own him for their God, to pray to him, and expect blessings from him. The bad figs were Zedekiah and those of his party yet in the land. These should be removed for their hurt, and forsaken of all mankind. God has many judgments, and those that escape one, may expect another, till they are brought to repent. Doubtless, this prophecy had its fulfilment in that age; but the Spirit of prophecy may here look forward to the dispersion of the unbelieving Jews, in all the nations of the earth. Let those who desire blessings from the Lord, beg that he will give them a heart to know him.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThat dwell in the land of Egypt - Neither those carried captive with Jehoahaz into Egypt, nor those who fled there, are to share in these blessings. The new life of the Jewish nation is to be the work only of the exiles in Babylon. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary8. in … Egypt—Many Jews had fled for refuge to Egypt, which was leagued with Judea against Babylon.Matthew Poole's Commentary Whither it is probable many of the Jews had fled, upon the coming, or noise of the coming, of the king of Babylon, as they had done before, Isaiah 30:2 31:1. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil,.... Here follows an explication of the evil figs, and an application of them to the wicked Jews: surely thus saith the Lord, so will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah; who was then the reigning king of Judah, Jeconiah's father's brother; whom the king of Babylon had made king in his stead, and changed his name from Mattaniah to Zedekiah, 2 Kings 24:17; him the Lord threatens to give up to ruin and destruction, or to deliver into the hands of the enemy: and his princes, and the residue of them, that remain in this land; the rest of the inhabitants of Jerusalem that continued in the land of Judea, and were not carried captive: and them that dwell in the land of Egypt; who had fled thither for safety upon the invasion of their land, and besieging their city; all these being like to the bad figs, exceeding evil and wicked, are threatened to be delivered into the hands of their enemies, though they might think themselves safe and secure where they were. Geneva Study BibleAnd as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell {d} in the land of Egypt:(d) Who fled there for comfort.",
