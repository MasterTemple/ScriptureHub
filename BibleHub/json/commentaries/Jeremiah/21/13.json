Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain — A description of Jerusalem, which was built in part upon the rocky mountain of Zion, but a great part of it was in the valley; and the higher mountains about mount Zion made that mountain itself, in comparison with them, to appear as a valley. Which say, Who shall come down against us? — They confided in the strength of their situation, as the Jebusites, the ancient inhabitants of the place, had formerly done. “Yet how many times,” says Bishop Newton, “was Jerusalem taken, though it was a very strong place and wonderfully fortified, both by nature and art! It was taken by Shishak king of Egypt, by Nebuchadnezzar, by Antiochus Epiphanes, by Pompey, by Socius, and Herod, before its final destruction by Titus.” I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof — The word forest is often metaphorically taken for a city in the prophetical writings. See Jeremiah 22:7; Ezekiel 20:46; Zechariah 11:1. Or it may mean the forest of Lebanon, or their houses made of wood cut out of that forest, especially those of the royal family, or their idolatrous groves. And it shall devour all things round about it — And this fire shall not end in the destruction of this city, but shall totally destroy all the adjacent country. Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary21:11-14 The wickedness of the king and his family was the worse because of their relation to David. They were urged to act with justice, at once, lest the Lord's anger should be unquenchable. If God be for us, who can be against us? But if he be against us, who can do any thing for us?Barnes' Notes on the BibleInhabitant - is feminine, the population of Jerusalem being always personified as a woman, the daughter of Zion. Omit and. Jerusalem is at once a valley and a rock Jeremiah 17:3. The people are described as priding themselves on the impregnability of their city. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary13. inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain—Jerusalem personified; situated for the most part on hills, with valleys at the bottom of them, as the valley of Hinnom, &c.; and beyond the valleys and mountains again, a position most fortified by nature, whence the inhabitants fancied themselves beyond the reach of enemies; but since God is \"against\" them, their position will avail nothing for them. The \"valley\" between Mount Zion and Moriah is called Tyropœon. Robinson takes, \"rock of the plain\" as Mount Zion, on which is a level tract of some extent. It is appropriately here referred to, being the site of the royal residence of the \"house of David,\" addressed (Jer 21:12).Matthew Poole's Commentary Inhabitant of the valley;  the inhabitants of the city of Jerusalem are those here intended, Psalm 125:2. The mountains were round about Jerusalem, yea, Jerusalem itself was builded in part upon the rocky mountain of Zion; but a great part was in the valley, and the higher mountains about Mount Zion made that mountain itself, in comparison with them, as a valley. And rock of the plain;  though also a rock of the plain, that is, near to the plain. Which situation of this place made the Jews think it to be impregnable, and to mock at dangers, or threats of enemies, saying, Who shall,  that is, Who can or who will, dare to come against us? or, Who will be able to enter into our city? Saith the Lord, I am against you; I will come down against you, and I, by such as I shall employ, will enter into your habitations. No natural position or situation of places, no artificial fortifications, are sufficient against an almighty God. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleBehold, I am against thee,.... Or, \"behold, I unto thee\" (s); to be supplied either thus, \"behold, I say unto thee\" (t); what follows; and therefore take notice of it, attend unto it: or, \"behold, I come unto thee\" (u); who bid defiance to all their enemies to come near them, as in the latter part of the verse. The Targum is, \"lo, I send my fury against thee;'' and the phrase denotes the Lord's opposition to them; his setting himself against them, and coming out unto them in his great wrath: O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the Lord; a description of Jerusalem; between the lower and higher part of which lay a valley, called Tyropaeon, which divided the two hills, on which the city was built (w); yea, the whole city was on high, on a rock, and around it a valley or plain; and because it was built upon a rock, and fortified with hills and mountains, the inhabitants of it thought themselves safe and secure, and even impregnable; hence it follows: which say, who shall come down against us? who shall enter into our habitations? who of our neighbours dare to make a descent upon us? or are so weak and foolish as to attempt to break through our fortifications, natural and artificial, and enter into our houses, and take away our persons, and spoil us of our goods? we defy them.
