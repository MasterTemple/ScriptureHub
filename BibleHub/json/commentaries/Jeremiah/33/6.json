All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, by pardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thus justified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace and purity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the people of God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It is promised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filled with joy.

Hitzig takes גּלּיתי in the meaning of גּלל, \"I roll to them like a stream,\" and appeals to Amos 5:24; Isaiah 48:18; Isaiah 66:12, where the fulness of prosperity is compared to a stream, and the waves of the sea; but this use of גּלה is as uncertain here as in Jeremiah 11:20.

Psalm 98:2, where it is parallel with הודיע), without any reference to the figure of sealed treasure-chambers (Deuteronomy 28:12), but with the accessory notion of the unfolding of the prosperity before all nations (Jeremiah 33:9), as in Psalm 98:2. עתרת is here to be taken as a noun, \"fulness, wealth,\" from עתר, an Aramaizing form for עשׁר, to be rich (Ezekiel 35:13). שׁלום ואמת does not mean \"prosperity and stability,\" but \"peace and truth;\" but this is not to be toned down to \"true peace,\" i.e., real, enduring happiness (Ngelsbach). אמת is the truth of God, i.e., His faithfulness in His promises and covenants, as in Psalm 85:11-12, where mercy and truth, righteousness and peace, are specified as the gracious benefits with which the Lord blesses His people.
