He imparts righteousness to his church, for he is made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made the righteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other, as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shall be secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royal priesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God; themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises of that covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. In Ga 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to be the Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despise the families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for a time they seem to be cast off.",

This transference, however, is not a mere hyperbole which misses the mark; for, as Jahn observes, an immense increase of the royal and priestly families would only have been a burden on the people (Graf).

The question is not about a \"change of the whole of Israel into the family of David and the tribe of Levi\" (Hengstenberg); and if the increase of the family of David and the Levites correspond in multitude with the number of all the people of Israel, this increase cannot be a burden on the people. But the question, whether this promise is to be understood literally, of the increase of the ordinary descendants of David and the Levites, or spiritually, of their spiritual posterity, cannot be decided, as Hengstenberg and Ngelsbach think, by referring to the words of the Lord in ",

The question that has been raised is rather to be decided in accordance with the general promises regarding the increase of Israel; and in conformity with these, we answer that it will not result from the countless increase of the descendants of Jacob according to the flesh, but from the incorporation, among the people of God, of the heathen who return to the God of Israel.

The occasion of this renewed confirmation was the allegation by the people, that the Lord had rejected the two families, i.e., Israel and Judah (cf. Jeremiah 31:27, Jeremiah 31:31; Jeremiah 32:20), called, Isaiah 8:14, the two houses of Israel. With such words they despised the people of the Lord, as being no longer a people before them, i.e., in their eyes, in their opinion. That those who spoke thus were Jews, who, on the fall of the kingdom of Judah, despaired of the continuance of God's election of Israel, is so very evident, that Hengstenberg may well find it difficult to understand how several modern commentators could think of heathens - Egyptians (Schnurrer), Chaldeans (Jahn), Samaritans (Movers), or neighbours of the Jews and of Ezekiel on the Chebar (Hitzig). The verdict pronounced on what these people said, \"they despise, or contemn, my people,\" at once relieves us from any need for making such assumptions, as soon as we assign the full and proper force to the expression \"my people\"  equals  the people of Jahveh. Just as in this passage, so too in Jeremiah 29:32, \"this people\" is interchanged with \"my people\" as a designation of the Jews. Moreover, as Graf correctly says, the expression \"this people\" nowhere occurs in the prophets of the exile as applied to the heathen; on the contrary, it is very frequently employed by Jeremiah to designate the people of Judah in their estrangement from the Lord: Jeremiah 4:10; Jeremiah 5:14, Jeremiah 5:23; Jeremiah 6:19; Jeremiah 7:33; Jeremiah 8:5; Jeremiah 9:14; Jeremiah 13:10; Jeremiah 14:10; Jeremiah 15:1, Jeremiah 15:20, and often elsewhere. \"My people,\" on the other hand, marks Judah and Israel as the people of God. In contrast with such contempt of the people of God, the Lord announces, \"If my covenant with day and night does not stand, if I have not appointed the laws of heaven and earth, then neither shall I cast away the seed of Jacob.\" The לא is repeated a second time before the verb. Others take the two antecedent clauses as one: \"If I have not made my covenant with day and night, the laws of heaven and earth.\" This construction also is possible; the sense remains unchanged. בּריתי יומם ולילה is imitated from Jeremiah 33:20. \"The laws of heaven and earth\" are the whole order of nature; cf. Jeremiah 31:35. The establishment, institution of the order of nature, is a work of divine omnipotence. This omnipotence has founded the covenant of grace with Israel, and pledged its continuance, despite the present destruction of the kingdom of Judah and the temporary rejection of the guilty people. But this covenant of grace includes not merely the choosing of David, but also the choosing of the seed of Jacob, the people of Israel, on the ground of which David was chosen to be the ruler over Israel. Israel will therefore continue to exist, and that, too, as a nation which will have rulers out of the seed of David, the servant of the Lord. \"The mention of the three patriarchs recalls to mind the whole series of the promises made to them\" (Hengstenberg). The plural משׁלים does not, certainly, refer directly to the promise made regarding the sprout of David, the Messiah, but at the same time does not stand in contradiction with it; for the revival and continued existence of the Davidic rule in Israel culminates in the Messiah. On כּי cf. Jeremiah 31:23; Jeremiah 30:3, Jeremiah 30:18, and the explanations on Jeremiah 32:44. The Qeri אשׁיב rests on Jeremiah 33:11, but is unnecessary; for אשׁוּב makes good enough sense, and corresponds better to ורחמתּים, in so far as it exactly follows the fundamental passage, Deuteronomy 30:3, where רחם is joined with שׁוּב את־שׁבוּת.
