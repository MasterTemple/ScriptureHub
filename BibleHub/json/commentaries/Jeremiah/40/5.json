The words ועדנּוּ  were certainly misunderstood by the old translators, who made various conjectures as to their meaning; even yet, Dahler, Movers, Graf, and Nהgelsbach are of opinion that \"it is impossible to understand\" this sentence, and that the text is plainly corrupt. Luther renders: \"for no one will any longer return thither.\" Hitzig considers this translation substantially correct, and only requiring to be a little more exactly rendered: \"but there, no one returns home again.\" Apart, however, from the consideration that on this view עדנּוּ, which stands at the head of the sentence, does not get full justice paid to it, the thought does not accord with what precedes, and the reference of the suffix to the indefinite \"person\" or \"one\" is extremely forced. According to what goes before, in which Nebuzaradan gives the prophet full liberty of choosing whether he would go with him to Babylon or remain in the country, in whatever part he likes, and from the following advice which he gives him, \"Go, or return, to Gedaliah,\" the words עדנּוּ לא ישׁוּב, on account of the third person (ישׁוּב), cannot certainly be an address of the chief captain to Jeremiah, and as little can they contain a remark about going to Babylon. The words are evidently, both as to their form and their contents, a circumstantial clause, containing a statement regarding the relation of Jeremiah to the proposal of the chief captain (and this is the view taken long ago by Kimchi), i.e., a parenthetical remark of the narrator, according to which Nebuzaradan demands that he shall remain with Gedaliah, in the sense, \"and yet he was not going back,\" or, still better, on account of the imperfect ישׁוּב, \"because he was still unwilling to go back,\" namely, to this or that place indefinitely; then Nebuzaradan further said, \"Return, then, to Gedaliah.\" If we supply ויּאמר before 'ושׁוּבה וגו, with which Nebuzaradan brings the matter to a close, the meaning is quite clear.
