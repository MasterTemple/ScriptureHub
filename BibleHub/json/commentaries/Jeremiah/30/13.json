The chastisement has commenced. From the wounds and blows which Israel has received, he lies motionless and helpless, getting neither sympathy nor aid from his lovers. The feminine suffix and the mention of lovers show that the address turns to the daughter of Zion. On the expression אנוּשׁ , \"it is ill with thy bruise,\" cf. Jeremiah 15:18. נחלה מכּה, \"bad, incurable is the stroke which thou hast received,\" as in Jeremiah 10:19; Jeremiah 14:17. דּוּן דּין, \"to execute justice;\" cf. Jeremiah 5:28; Jeremiah 22:16. Hitzig well explains the meaning: \"thy claims against thy heathen oppressors.\" למזור, although connected by the accents with what precedes, does not agree well with דּן דּינך; for מזור has not the meaning which has been attributed to it, of a \"bandage,\" but, as derived from the verb זוּר, \"to press a wound,\" signifies the wound that has been pressed together; see on Hosea 5:13. Neither does the figure of the wound agree with the expression, \"there is none to judge thy cause,\" so that we might, with Umbreit, render the passage, \"No one gives thee thy due, in pressing thy wounds;\" while, as Graf says, \" רפאות dissociated from למזור forms a useless synonym with תּעלה,\" and in Jeremiah 46:11, where the thought is repeated, it is separated from the latter word. Accordingly, with Hitzig and Graf, we connect למזור  into one clause: \"for the wound, there is no healing (or medicine)-no plaster.\" תּעלה is what is laid upon the wound, a plaster. \"All thy lovers,\" i.e., the nations which were once allied with thee (cf. Jeremiah 22:20, Jeremiah 22:22), do not trouble themselves about thee, because I have smitten thee so heavily on account of the multitude of thy transgressions; cf. Jeremiah 5:6; Jeremiah 13:22. עצמוּ still depends on the preposition על, which continues its force, but as a conjunction. The idea that the Israelites have richly deserved their sufferings is still more plainly presented in Jeremiah 30:15 : \"Why criest thou, because thou hast brought this suffering on thee through thy sins?\" אנוּשׁ also depends on על, which continues to exert its power in the sentence as a conjunction.",
