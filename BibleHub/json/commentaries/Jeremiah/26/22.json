Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary22. Jehoiakim sent … into Egypt—He had been put on the throne by Pharaoh of Egypt (2Ki 23:34). This explains the readiness with which he got the Egyptians to give up Urijah to him, when that prophet had sought an asylum in Egypt. Urijah was faithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work, so God permitted him to lose his life, while Jeremiah was protected in danger. The path of duty is often the path of safety.Matthew Poole's Commentary The innocent prophet considered not the king of Judah’s alliance with the king of Egypt, (obliging him upon demand to deliver up any of his subjects who, being charged with capital crimes, should flee into his country for sanctuary,) and fled thither; but the king sent after him one of his great men, (mentioned also Jeremiah 36:12) with some others to his assistance. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd Jehoiakim sent men into Egypt,.... To seek for him; and to require the delivery of him upon being found: namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor; the father of this man very probably is the same we read of in Josiah's time, 2 Kings 22:12; who is called Abdon in 2 Chronicles 34:20; and certain men with him, into Egypt; to assist him in taking him, whose names are not mentioned; Elnathan's is, as being the principal, and to fix an eternal infamy upon him. Geneva Study BibleAnd Jehoiakim the king {l} sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.(l) Here is declared the fury of tyrants who cannot stand to hear God's word declared but persecute the ministers of it, and yet in the end they prevail nothing but provoke God' judgments so much more.",
