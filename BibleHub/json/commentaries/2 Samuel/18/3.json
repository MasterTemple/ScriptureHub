But while they partly urge personal considerations, their chief argument is that David would be of more use if, posted with a body of troops at the city, he held himself in reserve to succour any division that might be in danger. And David, seeing how earnest their wish was, yielded to this representation, feeling that it would give steadiness to his men if they knew that so experienced a general was watching the fight, and was ready to succour them if they needed aid. As the people say that it would not matter \"if half of us die,\" and that David \"is worth ten thousand of us,\" Ewald draws the reasonable conclusion that their whole number was about twenty thousand men.
