The מן (from) is either a very ancient error of the pen that crept by accident into the text, or, if genuine and original, it is to be explained on the supposition that the historian dropped the construction with which he started, and instead of mentioning Baale-Jehudah as the place to which David went, gave it at once as the place from which he fetched the ark; so that the passage is to be understood in this way: \"And David went, and all the people who were with him, out of Baale-Jehudah, to which they had gone up to fetch the ark of God\" (Kimchi). In the sentence which follows, a difficulty is also occasioned by the repetition of the word שׁם in the clause עליו ... נקרא עשׁר, \"upon which the name is called, the name of Jehovah of hosts, who is enthroned above the cherubim.\" The difficulty cannot be solved by altering the first שׁם into שׁם, as Clericus, Thenius, and Bertheau suggest: for if this alteration were adopted, we should have to render the passage \"where the name of Jehovah of hosts is invoked, who is enthroned above the cherubim (which are) upon it (i.e., upon the ark);\" and this would not only introduce an unscriptural thought into the passage, but it would be impossible to find any suitable meaning for the word עליו, except by making very arbitrary interpolations. Throughout the whole of the Old Testament we never meet with the idea that the name of Jehovah was invoked at the ark of the covenant, because no one was allowed to approach the ark for the purpose of invoking the name of the Lord there; and upon the great day of atonement the high priest was only allowed to enter the most holy place with the cloud of incense, to sprinkle the blood of the atoning sacrifice upon the ark. Moreover, the standing expression for \"call upon the name of the Lord\" is יי בשׁם קרא; whereas פּ על יי שׁם נקרא signifies \"the name of Jehovah is called above a person or thing.\" Lastly, even if עליו belonged to הכּרבים ישׁב, it would not only be a superfluous addition, occurring nowhere else in connection with הך ישׁב, not even in ",

The only way in which we can obtain a biblical thought and grammatical sense is by connecting עליו with the אשׁר before נקרא: \"above which (ark) the name of Jehovah-Zebaoth is named,\" i.e., above which Jehovah reveals His glory or His divine nature to His people, or manifests His gracious presence in Israel. \"The name of God denotes all the operations of God through which He attests His personal presence in that relation into which He has entered to man, i.e., the whole of the divine self-manifestation, or of that side of the divine nature which is turned towards men\" (Oehler, Herzog's Real-Encycl. x. p. 197). From this deeper meaning of \"the name of God\" we may probably explain the repetition of the word שׁם, which is first of all written absolutely (as at the close of ",
