A gorgeous stone Temple might easily become the sepulchre, rather than the shrine, of true devotion. The movable tent answered to the temporary character of the ‘dispensation.’ The more fixed and elaborate the externals of worship, the more danger of the spirit being stifled by them.

The house of David must be firmly established and peace secured, before this great step in the history of the national religion could be advantageously taken.

In giving his approval he probably meant no more than that a permanent dwelling for Jehovah was what all pious men were hoping for. But from the days of Samuel to those of Ezra, there was never wanting one or even more holy men who were, on fit occasions, commissioned to bear a message from God to man; and as these generally belonged to the prophetic order, men too often now confound prophecy with prediction. So inveterate is this confusion that even in the Revised Version Amos is made to say, \"I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son,\" whereas the Hebrew distinctly is, \"I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son [that is, one trained in the prophetic schools], but I am a herdsman\" (",

Still, he did not belong to the prophetic order, nor wear the garment of black camel's hair, which was their professional dress. On the present occasion, Nathan, in approving, had spoken as a man, but now a Divine message comes to him. How we know not. but in ver. 17 it is called a \"vision;\" and it is also said that it came \"that night.\" 2 Samuel 7:4",
