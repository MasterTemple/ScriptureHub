The Syriac Version also translates 'gazelle,'\" but Ephrem says that the whole Israelite nation is meant, the flower of whoso manhood lay slaughtered on Mount Gilboa. Which signification we take must really depend upon the meaning we attach to the words, \"thy high place;\" and these in the Authorized Version have nothing to refer to, and so become unmeaning. The Revised Version follows the Vulgate in taking Israel as a vocative, sad renders, \"Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places.\" The sense would thus be that given by Ephrem, Israel's glory being its \"mighty\" men or heroes, its warriors slain upon Mount Gilboa with their king. But ver. 25 makes it plain that the \"high places\" are Jonathan's, and not those of the nation; and the more correct rendering is \"O beauty [or, 'gazelle'] of Israel, slain upon thy high places! how are the heroes fallen!\" Thus Jonathan is certainly meant, and the heroes are the young, prince and his father; and as the hunted antelope is said to return to its lair in the mountains, and there await its death, \"gazelle\" is probably the right rendering. In a dirge in honour of Saul and Jonathan we may be pretty sure that Jonathan would be referred to in its opening words, and the camp name of his friend would bring back to David's mind many a brave feat wrought together, and many a pleasant hour of companionship in past years. 2 Samuel 1:19",
