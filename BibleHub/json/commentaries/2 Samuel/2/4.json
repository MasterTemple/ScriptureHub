And it was reason sufficient, God’s will being obligatory upon all, and all being indispensably bound to obey it. This had been the sole foundation of Saul’s title to the kingdom, and on this ground only the Israelites had accepted him for their king. But this ground of claim Ish- bosheth, Saul’s son, had not, for he had not been appointed by God nor anointed by Samuel, or any other prophet. Indeed, properly speaking, he had no ground of claim at all, as the crown was never made hereditary in Saul’s family, but remained entirely at God’s disposal, who was the supreme king and governor of Israel, The men of Judah therefore were resolved to comply with the will and appointment of God, and not to neglect their duty, although they saw that the other tribes would neglect theirs. Yet they act with modesty; they make him king of Judah only, and not of all Israel. “Whether they did this with more despatch,” says Delaney, “to influence the determinations of the other tribes in his favour; or, whether it was delayed until their dispositions were sounded upon the point, is nowhere said. This, however, is certain, that one tribe’s acting separate and independent of the rest, was of dangerous example; nor could any thing but the divine authority justify it; and therefore it is not probable that this step was taken until all other expedients for a unanimous election had failed. And here he began the division of the kingdom, so lately predicted by Samuel;” as also, in part, the accomplishment of the prophecy delivered by Jacob, (",

The princes of Judah, therefore, offered him the crown over their tribe, and it was accepted. More could not, with prudence, be done in the circumstances of the country (1Ch 11:3).",
