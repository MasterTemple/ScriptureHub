Add to all this, that Abner commanded under Saul in all the expeditions he made against David; and it appears sufficiently from the history that David was greatly an over-match for him in all military conduct.

There he rallied the tribes around the standard of the unfortunate son of Saul.",

Jonathan, whose own name, \"Jehovah's gift,\" in Greek Theodore, is proof sufficient that Saul's family were worshippers of the true God, called his son's name Meribbaal, \"the Lord's strife\" (",
