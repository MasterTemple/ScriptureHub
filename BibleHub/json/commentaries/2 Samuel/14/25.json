That which feeds and gratifies pride, is not complained of, though uneasy. May the Lord grant us the beauty of holiness, and the adorning of a meek and quiet spirit!

Its extraordinary luxuriance compelled him to cut it \"at every year's end;\" lit., \"at times,\" \"from time to time,\" when it was found to weigh two hundred shekels—equal to one hundred twelve ounces troy; but as \"the weight was after the king's shekel,\" which was less than the common shekel, the rate has been reduced as low as three pounds, two ounces [Bochart], and even less by others.",
