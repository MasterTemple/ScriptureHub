The reading in the Chronicles, וּבמּגרות, is evidently a copyist's error, as we have already had בּמּגרה, \"with the saw.\" The meaning of the next clause is a disputed point, as the reading itself varies, and the Masoretes read בּמּלבּן instead of the Chethibh במלכן, \"he made them go through brick-kilns,\" i.e., burnt them in brick-kilns, as the lxx and Vulgate render it. On the other hand, Thenius takes the Chethibh under his protection, and adopts Kimchi's explanation: \"he led them through Malchan, i.e., through the place where the Ammonites burned their children in honour of their idol.\" Thenius would therefore alter בּמלכּם into בּמלכּם or בּמּלכּם: \"he offered them as sacrifices in their image of Moloch. \" But this explanation cannot be even grammatically sustained, to say nothing of the arbitrary character of the alteration proposed; for the technical expression למּלך בּאשׁ חעביר, \"to cause to go through the fire for Moloch\" (",

Moreover, it is impossible to see how burning the Ammonites in the image of Moloch could possibly be \"an obvious mode of punishing idolatry,\" since the idolatry itself consisted in the fact that the Ammonites burned their children to Moloch. So far as the circumstances themselves are concerned, the cruelties inflicted upon the prisoners are not to be softened down, as Daaz and others propose, by an arbitrary perversion of the words into a mere sentence to hard labour, such as sawing wood, burning bricks, etc. At the same time, the words of the text do not affirm that all the inhabitants of Rabbah were put to death in this cruel manner. בּהּ אשׁר העם (without כּל) refers no doubt simply to the fighting men that were taken prisoners, or at the most to the male population of the acropolis of Rabbah, who probably consisted of fighting men only. In doing this, David merely retaliated upon the Ammonites the cruelties with which they had treated their foes; since according to ",
