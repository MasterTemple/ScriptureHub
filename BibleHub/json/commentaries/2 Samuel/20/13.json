A soldier conjoined his name with David's, and such a magic spell was in the word \"Joab,\" that all the people \"went on\"—Amasa's men as well as the rest. The conjunction of these two names is very significant. It shows that the one could not afford to do without the other—neither Joab to rebel against David, nor David to get rid of Joab, though hating him.",
