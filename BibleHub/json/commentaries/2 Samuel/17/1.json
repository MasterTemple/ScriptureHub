The following words, וגו הכּל כּשׁוּב, \"as the return of the whole (the whole nation) is the man,\" i.e., the return of all is dependent upon David, for whom thou liest in wait, are somewhat difficult, though the meaning of Ahithophel is evident enough from what precedes: viz., if he is beaten, they will all come over to thee; \"the whole nation will be at peace\" (שׁלוּם is used adverbially).",
