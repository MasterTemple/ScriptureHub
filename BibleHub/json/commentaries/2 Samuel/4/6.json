The very act of going to get wheat at midday, when everybody was having his siesta, would itself be suspicious. The Syriac says nothing about wheat, but that these \"wicked men took and smote him.\" The Vulgate and LXX. lay the blame on the woman who kept the door, the narrative of the latter being as follows: \"They entered into the house of Ishbosheth in the heat of the day, and he was asleep in his midday chamber And behold, the woman that kept the door of the house had been winnowing wheat, and she slumbered and slept.
