And observe the steps of the sin. See how the way of sin is down-hill; when men begin to do evil, they cannot soon stop. Observe the aggravations of the sin.

Simultaneously with this war he had to meet the attack of the Edomites, for which purpose he detached Abishai with a portion of his army; and it was necessary also to post garrisons in their country, and in Atom of Damascus.

At the return of the year, i.e., at the commencement of spring, with which the new years began in the month Abib (Nisan), the time when kings who were engaged in war were accustomed to open their campaign, David sent Joab his commander-in-chief with the whole of the Israelitish forces to attack the Ammonites once more, for the purpose of chastising them and conquering their capital. The Chethibh המּלאכים should be changed into המּלכים, according to the Keri and the text of the Chronicles. The א interpolated is a perfectly superfluous mater lectionis, and probably crept into the text from a simple oversight. The \"servants\" of David with Joab were not the men performing military service, or soldiers, (in which case \"all Israel\" could only signify the people called out to war in extraordinary circumstances), but the king's military officers, the military commanders; and \"all Israel,\" the whole of the military forces of Israel. Instead of \"the children of Ammon\" we find \"the country of the children of Ammon,\" which explains the meaning more fully.
