The receiving revelations by Urim and Thummim was a priestly, and not a prophetic, function. Without altering the text, the words may be correctly translated, \"Seest thou?\" This was probably a colloquial phrase, of which the Septuagint gives the sense by rendering it in the imperative, \"See;\" while the Syriac, regarding it as an expletive, boldly omits it. 2 Samuel 15:27",

Consequently the word must be pointed thus, הראה (with the article), and rendered as a vocative, as it has been by Jerome and Luther. ראה, seer, is equivalent to prophet. He applies this epithet to Zadok, as the high priest who received divine revelations by means of the Urim. The meaning is, Thou Zadok art equal to a prophet; therefore thy proper place is in Jerusalem (O. v. Gerlach). Zadok was to stand as it were upon the watch there with Abiathar, and the sons of both to observe the events that occurred, and send him word through their sons into the plain of the Jordan. \"Behold, I will tarry by the ferries of the desert, till a word comes from you to show me,\" sc., what has taken place, or how the things shape themselves in Jerusalem.
