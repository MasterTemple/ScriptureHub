In Ahimelech's answer to Saul we have the language of conscious innocence. But what wickedness will not the evil spirit hurry men to when he gets the dominion! Saul alleges that which was utterly false and unproved. But the most bloody tyrants have found instruments of their cruelty as barbarous as themselves. Doeg, having murdered the priests, went to the city, Nob, and put all to the sword there. Nothing so vile but those may do it, who have provoked God to give them up to their hearts' lusts. Yet this was the accomplishment of the threatenings against the house of Eli. Though Saul was unrighteous in doing this, yet God was righteous in permitting it. No word of God shall fall to the ground.",

The force of the word \"begin\" lies in this, that it would have been his first act of allegiance to David and defection from Saul. This he strenuously repudiates, and adds, \"thy servant knew nothing of all this\" conspiracy between Jonathan and David of which Saul speaks: he had acted quite innocently. ",
