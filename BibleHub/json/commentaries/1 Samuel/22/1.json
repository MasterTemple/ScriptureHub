David chose one of these natural fastnesses as the temporary home for himself and his followers. The traveller sees that there was ample room for the 400 refugees who gathered under David’s skilled leadership. Stanley even speaks of this Adullam Cavern as “a subterranean palace, with vast columnar halls and arched chambers.”",

Observe with what tender concern David provided for his aged parents. The first thing he does is to find them a quiet habitation, whatever became of himself. Let children learn to honour their parents, in every thing consulting their ease and satisfaction. Though highly preferred, and much employed, let them not forget their aged parents.

Eight miles from the valley head stands Shochoh,...  and two and a half miles south of this is a very large and ancient terebinth.\" This stands on \"the west side of the vale, just where a small tributary ravine joins the main valley; and on the south of this ravine is a high rounded hill, almost isolated by valleys, and covered with ruins, a natural fortress,\" the site of the city Adullam. David's cave, he considers, would not be one of the larger caverns, as these are seldom used for habitations; but \"the sides of the tributary valley are lined with rows of caves, and these we found inhabited, and full of flocks and herds; but still more interesting was the discovery of a separate cave on the hill itself, a low, smoke-blackened burrow, which was the home of a single family. We could not but suppose, as we entered this gloomy abode, that our feet were standing in the very footprints of the shepherd king, who here, encamped between the Philistines and the Jews, covered the line of advance on the cornfields of Keilah, and was but three miles distant from the thickets of Hareth.\" After describing the fine view from this hill, which is about 500 feet high, he adds, \"There is ample room to have accommodated David's 400 men in the caves, and they are, as we have seen, still inhabited.\" Thus then David's cave was one of many in the Terebinth valley and the ravine opening into it, and was not far from Gath, though over the border.
