God did not, therefore, pronounce that they would deliver him up to Saul, because he had laid them under any absolute necessity of so doing; but because he saw Saul’s secret designs, on the one hand, and the secret workings of their minds, and their tendency to fear and baseness, on the other.

God allows us to be so in our addresses to him; Lord, direct me in this matter, about which I am now at a loss.
