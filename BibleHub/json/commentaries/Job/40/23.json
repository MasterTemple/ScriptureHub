This vast animal is noticed as an argument to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created this vast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whatever strength this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. He that made the soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make the sword of justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it.

It usually means to oppress, to treat with violence and injustice; and to defraud, or extort. But a very different sense is given to this verse by Bochart, Gesenius, Noyes, Schultens, Umbreit, Prof. Lee, and Rosenmuller. According to the interpretation given by them the meaning is, \"The stream overfloweth, and he feareth not; he is secure, even though Jordan rush forth even to his mouth.\" The reference then would be, not to the fact that he was greedy in his mode of drinking, but to the fact that this huge and fierce animal, that found its food often on the land, and that reposed under the shade of the lotus and the papyrus, could live in the water as well as on the land, and was unmoved even though the impetuous torrent of a swollen river should overwhelm him.",

It is also the most natural and obvious interpretation. It is impossible to make good sense of the phrase \"he oppresseth a river;\" nor does the word used properly admit of the translation \"he drinketh up.\" The word \"river\" in this place, therefore (נהר  nâhâr), is to be regarded as in the nominative case to     יעשׁק  ya‛âshaq, and the meaning is, that when a swollen and impetuous river rushes along and bears all before it, and, as it were, \"oppresses\" everything in its course, he is not alarmed; he makes no effort to flee; he lies perfectly calm and secure. What was \"remarkable\" in this appears to have been, that an animal that was so much on land, and that was not properly a fish, should be thus calm and composed when an impetuous torrent rolled over him. The Septuagint appears to have been aware that this was the true interpretation, for they render this part of the verse, Ἐάν γέηται πλνμμύρα, κ.τ.λ.  Ean genētai plēmmura, etc. - \"Should there come a flood, he would not regard it.\" Our common translation seems to have been adopted from the Vulgate - \"Ecceabsorbebit fluvium.\"",

Even such an impetuous torrent would not alarm him. Being amphibious, he would not dread what would fill a land animal with alarm. There is no evidence that the hippopotamus was ever found in the river Jordan, nor is it necessary to suppose this in order to understand this passage.
