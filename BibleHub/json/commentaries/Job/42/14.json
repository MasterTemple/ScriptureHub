His troubles began in Satan's malice, which God restrained; his restoration began in God's mercy, which Satan could not oppose. Mercy did not return when Job was disputing with his friends, but when he was praying for them. God is served and pleased with our warm devotions, not with our warm disputes. God doubled Job's possessions. We may lose much for the Lord, but we shall not lose any thing by him. Whether the Lord gives us health and temporal blessings or not, if we patiently suffer according to his will, in the end we shall be happy. Job's estate increased. The blessing of the Lord makes rich; it is he that gives us power to get wealth, and gives success in honest endeavours. The last days of a good man sometimes prove his best, his last works his best works, his last comforts his best comforts; for his path, like that of the morning light, shines more and more unto the perfect day.",

They are significant, and they are \"so\" mentioned as to show that they contributed greatly to the happiness of Job on the return of his prosperity, and were among the chief blessings which gladdened his old age. The name Jemima (ימימה  yemı̂ymâh) is rendered by the Vulgate \"Diem,\" and by the Septuagint, Ἡμέραν  Hēmeran, \"Day.\" The Chaldee adds this remark: \"He gave her the name Jemima, because her beauty was like the day.\" The Vulgate, Septuagint, and Chaldee, evidently regarded the name as derived from יום  yôm, \"day,\" and this is the most natural and obvious derivation.
