        "text": "As for me, is my complaint to man? - There is some difficulty in the interpretation of this verse, and considerable variety of explanation may be seen among expositors. The \"object\" of the verse is plain. It is to state a reason why they should hear him with patience and without interruption. The meaning of this part of the verse probably is, that his principal difficulty was not with his friends, but with God. It was not so much what they had said, that gave him trouble, as it was what God had done. Severe and cutting as were their rebukes, yet it was far more trying to him to be treated as he had been by God, \"as if\" he were a great sinner. That was what he could not understand. Perplexed and troubled, therefore, by the mysteriousness of the divine dealings, his friends ought to be willing to listen patiently to what he had to say; and in his anxiety to find out \"why\" God had treated him so, they ought not at once to infer that he was a wicked man, and to overwhelm him with increased anguish of spirit.",

It was a matter which he wished to refer to the Almighty, and he ought to be allowed to express his sentiments with entire freedom. One of the difficulties in understanding this verse arises from the word \"complaint.\" We use it in the sense of \"murmuring,\" or \"repining;\" but this, I think, is not its meaning here. It is used rather in the sense of \"cause, argument, reasoning, or reflections.\" The Hebrew word שׂיח  śı̂yı̂ch means, properly, that which is \"brought out\" - from שׂיח  śı̂yach, \"to bring out, to put forth, to produce\" - as buds, leaves, flowers; and then it means \"words\" - as brought out, or spoken; and then, meditations, reflections, discourses, speeches; and then it \"may\" mean \"complaint.\" But there is no evidence that the word is used in that sense here. It means his reflections, or arguments. They were not to man. He wished to carry them at once before God, and he ought, therefore, to be allowed to speak freely.
