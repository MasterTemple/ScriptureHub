He reconciles this to the holiness and justice of God. Even while they prosper thus, they are light and worthless, of no account with God, or with wise men. In the height of their pomp and power, there is but a step between them and ruin. Job refers the difference Providence makes between one wicked man and another, into the wisdom of God. He is Judge of all the earth, and he will do right. So vast is the disproportion between time and eternity, that if hell be the lot of every sinner at last, it makes little difference if one goes singing thither, and another sighing. If one wicked man die in a palace, and another in a dungeon, the worm that dies not, and the fire that is not quenched, will be the same to them. Thus differences in this world are not worth perplexing ourselves about.",

The Vulgate renders it, Viscera ejus plena sunt adipe - \"his viscera are full of fat.\" So the Septuagint, τὰ ἔγκατα ἀυτοῦ πλήρη στέατος  ta engkata autou plērē steatos. The Syraic, \"his sides;\" Prof. Lee, \"his bottles;\" Noyes, \"his sides;\" Luther, \"sein milkfass\" - \"his milk-pail;\" Wemyss, \"the stations of his cattle;\" Good, \"his sleek skin.\" In this variety of rendering, what hope is there of ascertaining the meaning of the word? It is not easy to account for this variety, though it is clear that Jerome and the Septuagint followed a different reading from the present, and instead of עטיניו  ‛ăṭı̂ynāyv, they read בטיניו  baṭı̂ynāyv - from בטן  beṭen - \"the belly;\" and that instead of the word חלב  châlâb as at present pointed, meaning \"milk,\" they understood it as if it were pointed חלב  cheleb - meaning \"fat\" - the same letters, but different vowels.",

P. 1, Lib. ii. c. xliv., pp. 455, 458; or Rosenmuller, where the remarks of Bochart are abridged; or Lee on Job, \"in loc.\" The Chaldee renders it ביזיו, \"his breasts.\" So Junius et Tre. Piscator, and others. Among the rabbis, Moses Bar Nackman, Levi, and others, render it as denoting the breasts, or \"mulctralia\" - \"milk-vessels,\" denoting, as some have supposed, \"the lacteals.\" This idea would admirably suit the connection, but it is doubtful whether it can be maintained; and the presumption is, that it would be in advance of the knowledge of physiology in the times of Job. Aben Ezra explains it of the places where camels lie down to drink - an idea which is found in the Arabic, and which will well suit the connection.",

The Hebrew word עטין  ‛ăṭı̂yn, as has been observed, occurs nowhere else. It is supposed to be derived from an obsolete root, the same as the Arabic \"atana, to lie down around water, as cattle do;\" and then the derivative denotes a place where cattle and flocks lie down around water; and then the passage would mean, \"the resting places of his herds are full, or abound with milk.\" Yet the primary idea, according to Castell, Golius, and Lee, is that of saturating with water; softening, \"scil.\" a skin with water, or dressing a skin, for the purpose of using it as a bottle. Perhaps the word was used with reference to the place where camels came to drink, because it was a place that was \"saturated\" with water, or that abounded with water. The Arabic verb, also, according to Castell, is used in the sense of freeing a skin from wool and hairs - a lana pilisve levari pellem - so that it might be dressed for use.",

But it is very doubtful whether the word will bear this meaning, and whether it is ever used in this sense. In the instances adduced by Castell, Schultens, and even of Prof. Lee, of the use of the word, I find no one where it means \"a skin,\" or denotes a bottle made of a skin. The application of the \"verb\" to a skin is only in the sense of saturating and dressing it. The leading idea in all the forms of the word, and its common use in Arabic, is \"that of a place where cattle kneel down for the purpose of drinking,\" and then a place well watered, where a man might lead his camels and flocks to water. The noun would then come to mean a watering place - a place that would be of great value, and which a man who had large flocks and herds would greatly prize. The thought here is, therefore, that the places of this kind, in the possession of the man referred to, would abound with milk - that is, he would have abundance.",
