Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are all outward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something with which Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees that death will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring him to death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits.

The \"stretching of His hand\" to punish after death answers antithetically to the raising \"the cry\" of prayer in the second clause. Maurer gives another translation which accords with the scope of Job 30:24-31; if it be natural for one in affliction to ask aid, why should it be considered (by the friends) wrong in my case? \"Nevertheless does not a man in ruin stretch out his hand\" (imploring help, Job 30:20; La 1:17)? If one be in his calamity (destruction) is there not therefore a \"cry\" (for aid)? Thus in the parallelism \"cry\" answers to \"stretch—hand\"; \"in his calamity,\" to \"in ruin.\" The negative of the first clause is to be supplied in the second, as in Job 30:25 (Job 28:17).",

To give all the different renderings, and discuss them, would be an almost endless task, and one over-wearisome to the reader.

This is the rendering of Professor Stanley Leathes, who suggests the following: \"Howbeit God will not put forth his hand to bring a man to death and the grave, when there is earnest prayer for them, not even when he himself hath caused the calamity.\" The same writer further explains the passage as follows: \"I know that thou wilt dissolve and destroy me, and bring me to the grave (ver. 23), though thou wilt not do so when I pray to thee to release me by death from my sufferings. Thou wilt surely do so [some time or other], but not in my time, or according to my will, but only in thine own appointed time, and as thou seest fit.\" Job 30:24",

The originally affirmative אך has certainly for the most part a restrictive signification, which, as we observed on Job 18:21, is blended with the affirmative in Hebr., but it is also, as more frequently אכן, used adversatively, e.g., Job 16:7, and in the combination אך לא this adversative signification coincides with the restrictive, for this double particle signifies everywhere else: only not, however not, Genesis 20:12; 1 Kings 11:39; 2 Kings 12:14; 2 Kings 13:6; 2 Kings 23:9, 2 Kings 23:26.

This involuntary reaction against destruction is the inevitable result of man's instinct of self-preservation. It needs no proof that שׁלח יד can signify \"to stretch out one's hand for help;\" ישׁלח is used with a general subj.: one stretches out, as Job 17:5; Job 21:22. With this determination of the idea of Job 30:24, Job 30:24 is now also naturally connected with what precedes. It is not, however, to be translated, as Ew. and Hirz.: if one is in distress, is not a cry for help heard on account of it? If אם were intended hypothetically, a continuation of the power of the interrogative לא from Job 30:24 would be altogether impossible. Hahn and Loch-Reischl rightly take אם in the sense of an. It introduces another turn of the question: Does one, however, not stretch out one's hand to hasten the fall, or in his downfall (raise) a cry for help, or a wail, on that account? Dderlein's conjecture, לחן for להן (praying \"for favour\"), deserves respectful mention, but it is not needed: להן signifies neutrally: in (under) such circumstances (comp. בּהם, Job 22:21; Isaiah 64:5), or is directly equivalent to להן, which (Ruth 1:13) signifies propterea, and even in biblical Chaldee, beside the Chaldee signif. sed, nisi, retains this Hebrew signif.
