Job means to describe those who were reduced by poverty and want, and who were without respectability or home, and who had no power in any way to affect him. He states that they were so abject and worthless as not to be worth his attention; but even this fact is intended to show how low he was himself reduced, since even the most degraded ranks in life did not show any respect to one who had been honored by princes. The Vulgate renders this, \"The strength - virtus - of whose hands is to me as nothing, and they are regarded as unworthy of life.\" The Septuagint, \"And the strength of their hands what is it to me? Upon whom perfection - συντέλεια  sunteleia - has perished.\" Coverdale, \"The power and strength of their hands might do me no good, and as for their age, it is spent and passed away without any profit.\" The literal translation is, \"Even the strength of their hands, what is it to me?\" The meaning is, that their power was not worth regarding. They were abject, feeble, and reduced by hunger - poor emaciated creatures, who could do him neither good nor evil.
