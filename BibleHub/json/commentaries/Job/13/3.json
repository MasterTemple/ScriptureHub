To Him we may speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value.

True, he has said in Job 9 that no one can maintain his cause before God; but his confidence in God grows in proportion as his distrust of the friends increases; and at the same time, the hope is begotten that God will grant him that softening of the terror of His majesty which he has reserved to himself in connection with this declaration (Job 9:34, comp.

This explanation is also confirmed by Job 14:17.
