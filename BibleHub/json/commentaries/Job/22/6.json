No way of treating an unfortunate and a suffering man could be more unkind. A \"pledge\" is that which is given by a debtor to a creditor, for security for the payment of a debt, and would be, of course, that which was regardcd as of value. Garments, which constituted a considerable part of the wealth of the Orientals, would usually be the pledge which would be given. With us, in such cases, watches, jewelry, notes, mortgages, are given as collateral security, or as pledges.

Here the case is not quite the same; Job is charged with taking a pledge where he had no just claim to it; and in the second clause, that pledge (the outer garment which served the poor as a covering by day and a bed by night) is represented as taken from one who had not \"changes of raiment\" (a common constituent of wealth in the East), but was poorly clad—\"naked\" (Mt 25:36; Jas 2:15); a sin the more heinous in a rich man like Job.",
