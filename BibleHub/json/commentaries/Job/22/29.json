Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lot to suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, how Jesus was reviled, that we may be patient. Let us examine whether there may not be some colour for the slander, and walk watchfully, so as to be clear of all appearances of evil.",

As השׁפּיל signifies to make low, it can also signify to go down (Jeremiah 13:18), and said of ways, \"to lead downwards\" (Rosenm., Ew., Hahn). The old expositors go altogether astray in Job 22:29, because they did not discern the exclamative idea of גּוה. The noun גּוה - which is formed from the verb גּוה  equals  גּאה, as גּאהּ, arrogance, Proverbs 8:13; גּהה, healing, Proverbs 17:22; כּהה, mitigation, Nahum 3:19 (distinct from גּוה, the body, the fem. of גּו), without the necessity of regarding it as syncopated from גּאוה (Olsh. 154, b), as שׁלה,   1 Samuel 1:17, from שׁאלה - does not here signify pride or haughtiness, as in Job 33:17; Jeremiah 13:17, but signifies adverbially sursum (therefore synon. of סלה, which, being formed from סל, elevatio, with He of direction and Dag. forte implic., as פּדּנה, הרה  equals  paddannah, harrah, - perhaps, however, it is to be read directly סלּה, with He fem., - is accordingly a substantive made directly into an adverb, like גּוה): suppose that (כּי  equals  ἐάν, as אם  equals  εἰ) thy ways lead downwards, thou sayest: on high! i.e., thy will being mighty in God, thy confidence derived from the Almighty, will all at once give them another and more favourable direction: God will again place in a condition of prosperity and happiness, - which יושׁע (defectively written; lxx: σώσει; Jer. and Syr., however, reading יוּשׁע: salvabitur), according to its etymon, Arab. 'ws‛, signifies, - him who has downcast eyes (lxx κύφοντα ὀφθαλμοῖς).LinksJob 22:29 InterlinearJob 22:29 Parallel TextsJob 22:29 NIVJob 22:29 NLTJob 22:29 ESVJob 22:29 NASBJob 22:29 KJVJob 22:29 Bible AppsJob 22:29 ParallelJob 22:29 Biblia ParalelaJob 22:29 Chinese BibleJob 22:29 French BibleJob 22:29 German BibleBible Hub",
