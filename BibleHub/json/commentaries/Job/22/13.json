The philosophy of this is plain. He advances a certain opinion. \"We\" infer at once that he can hold that only on certain grounds, or that if he holds that he must hold something else also. We can see that if \"we\" held that opinion, we should also, for the sake of consistency, be compelled to hold something which seems to follow from it, and we cannot see how this can be avoided, and we at once charge him with holding it. But the truth may be, that \"he\" has not seen that such consequences follow, or that he has some other way of accounting for the fact than we have; or that he may hold to the fact and yet deny wholly the consequences which legitimately follow from it. Now we have a right to show him \"by argument\" that his opinions, if he would follow them out, would lead to dangerous consequences, but we have a right to charge him with holding only what he \"professes\" to hold. He is not answerable for our inferences; and we have no right to charge them on him as being his real opinions.

The imagery was, no doubt, at first used in reference to man's inability to see and know God; but when men became familiar with it, they turned the metaphor round, and questioned God's ability to see and know anything about man.

The expression \"head of the stars\" is therefore somewhat like fastigium coeli (the extreme height, i.e., the middle of the vault of heaven), or culmen aereum (of the aether separating the strata of air above); the summit of the stars rising up into the extremest spheres is intended (we should say: the fixed stars, or to use a still more modern expression, the milky way), as also the רמו naturally refers to ראשׁ כוכבים as one notion (summitas astrorum  equals  summa astra).",
