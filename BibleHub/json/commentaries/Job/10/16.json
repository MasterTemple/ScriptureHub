Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will not destroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renew him unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life.

But a somewhat different explanation is given to it by many interpreters. The word rendered \"increaseth\" (גאה  gâ'âh) means properly, to lift up, to lift up oneself, to rise; and Gesenius supposes that it refers here to \"the head,\" and that the meaning is, \"if it lift up itself (sc. my head), thou huntest me as a lion.\" It cannot be denied that the notion of pride, elation, haughtiness, is usually connected with the use of the word, but it is not necessary here to depart from the common interpretation, meaning that the increase of his affliction greatly augmented his perplexity. Jerome, however, readers it, \"and on account of pride, thou dost seize me as a lioness.\" The idea is, \"my affliction, as it were, exalts itself, or, becomes more and more prominent.\" This is a better interpretation than to refer it to the raising up of his head.",
