Never was any doctrine better explained, or worse applied, than this by Zophar, who intended to prove Job a hypocrite. Let us receive the good explanation, and make a better application, for warning to ourselves, to stand in awe and sin not.

This seems to be the general sense of the verse; and it is not necessary to attempt to show \"how\" it would be done - whether by lightning from heaven, as Noyes supposes, or whether by some direct manifestation from the skies.
