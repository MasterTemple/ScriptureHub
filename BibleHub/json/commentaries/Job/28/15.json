Prof. Lee supposes that the idea is derived from the use of the word, and of similar words in Arabic, where the idea of heating, fusing, giving another color, changing the shape, and thence of fixing, retaining, etc., is found; and that the idea here is that of fused or purified gold. Michaelis supposes that it refers to \"native\" gold that is pure and unadulterated, or the form of gold called \"dendroides,\" from its shooting out in the form of a tree - \"baumartig gewachsenes Gold\" (from the Arabic, \"a tree\"). It is not known, however, that the Hebrew word סגר was always used to denote a tree. There can be no doubt that the word denotes \"gold\" of a pure kind, and it may have been given to it because gold of that kind was carefully \"shut up\" in places of safe keeping; but it would seem more probable to me that it was given to it for some reason now unknown. Of many of the names now given by us to objects which are significant, and which are easily understood by us, it would be impossible to trace the reason or propriety, after the lapse of four thousand years.",
