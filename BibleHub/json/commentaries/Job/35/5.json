The general object of the reply is, to show that God is so great that he cannot be affected with human conduct, and that he has no interest in treating people otherwise than according to character. He is so exalted that their conduct cannot reach and affect his happiness. It ought to be \"presumed,\" therefore, since there is no motive to the contrary, that the dealings of God with people would be impartial, and that there \"would\" be an advantage in serving him - not because people could lay him under \"obligation,\" but because it was right and proper that such advantage should accrue to them. To impress this view on the mind, Elihu directs Job and his friends to look to the heavens - so lofty, grand, and sublime; to reflect how much higher they are than man; and to remember that the great Creator is \"above\" all those heavens, and \"thus\" to see that he is so far cxalted that he is not dependent on man; that he cannot be affected by the righteousness or wickedness of his creatures; that his happiness is not dependent on them, and consequently that it is to bc presumed that he would act impartially, and treat all people as they deserved. There \"would\" be, therefore, an advantage in serving God.",
