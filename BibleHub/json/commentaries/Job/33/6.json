Some have, however, rendered this differently. Umbreit translates it, ich bin, wie du, von Gott - I am, as thou art, from God. So Noyes, \"I, like thee, am a creature of God.\" Wemyss, \"I am thine equal in the sight of God.\" Coverdale, \"Behold, before God am I even as thou, for I am fashioned and made even of the same mould.\" The Vulgate renders it, \"Behold God made me as he made thee; and of the same clay am I formed.\" So the Septuagint, \"From clay am I formed as well as thou, and we are formed from the same.\" This interpretation seems to be demanded also by the parallelism, where he says that he was made of the same clay with Job; that is, that he was a man like him. Still, it seems to me, that the fair and obvious meaning of the Hebrew is that which is expressed in our common version. The Hebrew is, לאל כפיך הן־אני כפי  hēn'ănı̂y kepiykā lā'ĕl - \"lo, I am, according to thy mouth (word, or wish) for God;\" that is, I am in his place; I speak in his name; I am so commissioned by him that you may regard yourself as in fact speaking to him when you address his ambassador.
