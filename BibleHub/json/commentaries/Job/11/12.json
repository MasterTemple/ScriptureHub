Zophar refers to a hollow-hearted man, who, though he was in fact like a wild ass's colt, attempted to appear mild and gentle, and to have a heart. The meaning is, that man by nature has a spirit untamed and unsubdued, and that with this, he assumes the appearance of gentleness and tenderness, and attempts to appear as if he was worthy of love and affection. God, seeing this hollow-heartedness, treats him accordingly. The reference here is to men like Job, and Zophar undoubtedly meant to say that he was hollow-hearted and insincere, and yet that he wished to appear to be a man having a heart, or, having true piety.",

The most simple and obvious seems to be the true one, though I have not seen it noticed by any of the commentators. The word rendered \"would be wise\" (ילבב  yı̂lâbēb) is from לבב  lâbab, or לב  lêb, meaning \"heart,\" and the sense here, as it seems to me, is, \"vain, hollow, and insincere, man would wish to seem to have a heart;\" that is, would desire to appear sincere, or pious. Destitute of that truly, and false and hollow, he would nevertheless wish to appear different, and would put on the aspect of sincerity and religion. This is the most simple exposition, and this accords with the drift of the passage exactly, and expresses a sentiment which is unquestionably true. Gesenius, however, and some others render it, \"but man is hollow and wanteth understanding; yea, man is born like a wild ass's colt, signifying the weakness and dullness of the human understanding in comparison with the divine wisdom.\" Others render it, \"but the foolish man becometh wise when the wild ass's colt shall become a man,\" that is, never, a most forced and unnatural construction.
