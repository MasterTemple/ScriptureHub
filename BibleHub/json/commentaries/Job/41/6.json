Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.",

Gesenius renders it, \"Do the companions (\"i. e.\" the fishermen in company) lay snares for him?\" So Noyes renders it. Dr. Harris translates it, \"Shall thy partners spread a banquet for him?\" The Septuagint renders it, \"Do the nations feed upon him?\" The Vulgate, \"Will friends cut him up?\" that is, for a banquet. Rosenmuller renders it, \"Will friends feast upon him?\" The word rendered \"thy companions\" (חברים  chabbâriym) means properly those joined or associated together for any purpose, whether for friendship or for business. It may refer here either to those associated for the purpose of fishing or feasting. The word \"thy\" is improperly introduced by our translators, and there is no evidence that the reference is to the companions or friends of Job, as that would seem to suppose. The word rendered \"make a banquet\" (יכרוּ  yikârû) is from כרה  kârâh, \"to dig,\" and then to make a plot or device against one - derived from the fact that a \"pitfall\" was dug to take animals (",

According to this, the meaning is, \"Do the companions, \"i. e.\" those associated for the purpose of feasting, make a banquet of him?\" Which is the true sense here it is not easy to determine. The majority of versions incline to the idea that it refers to a feast, and means that those associated for eating do not make a part of their entertainment of him.
