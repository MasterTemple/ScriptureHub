God says that no one could thus surprise and overpower him. Thus explained, the sentiment agrees with the argument which the Almighty is presenting. He is showing his right to reign and do all his pleasure. He appeals, in proof of this, to his great and mighty works, and especially to those specimens of the animal creation which \"man\" could not tame or overcome. The argument is this: \"If man cannot surprise and subdue these creatures of the Almighty, and compel \"them\" to render him service, how can he expect to constrain the Creator himself to be tributary to him, or to grant him the favors which he demands?\"",

If he explains himself to any extent, if he condescends to give an account of any of his doings, it is of pure grace and favour.

But Hebrew poetry is erratic, and pays little regard to logical lawn If anything important has been omitted in its more proper place, it is inserted in one which is, humanly speaking, less proper.
