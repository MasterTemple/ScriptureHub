The sword of him that layeth at him — That approacheth to him, and dares to strike at him; cannot hold — Hebrew, בלי תקום, beli takum, cannot stand. Either, 1st, Cannot endure the stroke, but will be broken by it; or, 2d, Cannot take hold of him, or abide fixed in him; but is instantly beaten back by the excessive hardness of his skin, which cannot be pierced by it. This also seems much better to agree to the crocodile, whose skin no sword, nor dart, nor (as some add) musket-ball can pierce, than to the whale, whose skin is easily pierced, as experience shows, except the whales here spoken of were of another kind than those we are acquainted with. Nor the habergeon — Hebrew, שׁריה, shirjah, which the margin of our Bible renders, breast-plate, and Ab. Ezra, a coat of mail, as the word means 1 Samuel 17:38. But Heath and Houbigant translate it here, the pike; and it evidently means some missile weapon.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary41:1-34 Concerning Leviathan. - The description of the Leviathan, is yet further to convince Job of his own weakness, and of God's almighty power. Whether this Leviathan be a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job how unable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power in that mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force of Leviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under a humbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty; take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and give all glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom every good gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humbly with the Lord.Barnes' Notes on the BibleThe sword of him that layeth at him - The word \"sword\" here (חרב  chereb) means undoubtedly \"harpoon,\" or a sharp instrument by which an attempt is made to pierce the skin of the monster.Cannot hold - That is, in the hard skin. It does not penetrate it.The spear, the dart - These were doubtless often used in the attempt to take the animal. The meaning is, that \"they\" would not hold or stick to the animal. They flew off when hurled at him.Nor the habergeon - Margin, \"breastplate.\" Noyes, \"javelin.\" Prof. Lee, \"lance.\" Vulgate, \"thorax, breastplate.\" So the Septuagint, θώρακα  thōraka. The word used here (שׁריה  shiryâh), the same as שׁריון  shiryôn 1 Samuel 17:5, 1 Samuel 17:38; Nehemiah 4:16; 2 Chronicles 26:14, means properly a \"coat of mail,\" and is so called from its shining - from שׁרה  shârâh, \"to shine.\" It is not used in the sense of spear or javelin elsewhere, though perhaps it may have that meaning here - denoting a \"bright\" or \"shining\" weapon. This agrees best with the connection. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary26. cannot hold—on his hard skin.habergeon—coat of mail; avail must be taken by zeugma out of \"hold,\" as the verb in the second clause: \"hold\" cannot apply to the \"coat of mail.\"Matthew Poole's Commentary That layeth at him;  that approacheth to him, and dare strike at him. Cannot hold,  Heb. cannot stand, i.e. either, 1. Cannot endure the stroke, but will be broken by it. Or rather, 2. Cannot abide or take hold of him, or be fixed in him; but is instantly beaten back by the excessive hardness of the skin, which cannot be pierced by it, as may be gathered from this and other passages before and after it. This also seems better to agree to the crocodile, whose skin no sword, nor dart, nor musket bullet (as others add) can pierce, than to the whale, whose skin is easily pierced, as experience showeth in our whales; except the whale here spoken of were of another kind, which is not impossible. Nor the habergeon;  or, breastplate. As offensive weapons cannot hurt him, so defensive weapons cannot secure a man from him. But men that go upon the design of taking either whales or crocodiles do not use to fortify themselves in that manner. Some therefore take this to be another offensive weapon, a kind of dart, as this word signifies in the Arabic language; which is but a dialect of the Hebrew, and from which the true signification of many Hebrew words must be gathered. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleThe sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold,.... It is either broken by striking at him, or however cannot pierce him and stick in him; but since a sword is not used in fishery, rather the harpagon or harpoon may be meant, which cannot enter into the crocodile, being so fenced with scales; but the whale being struck with it, it enters deep into his flesh, and is wounded by it; wherefore this and what follows in the next verses seems best to agree with the crocodile, or some other fish; the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon; that is, neither of these can fasten upon him or enter into him: and yet it is certain that the whale, after he has been struck and wounded by the harping-iron, men approach nearer to him and thrust a long steeled lance or spear under his gills into his breast, and through the intestines, which dispatches him: darts are not made use of in the whale fishery; and as for crocodiles, as Peter Martyr says (c), they are not to be pierced with darts: the habergeon, or coat of mail, being a defensive piece of armour, seems not to be designed, as being never used in taking such creatures; rather therefore a javelin or hand dart may be intended; since, as Bochart observes, in the Arabic language such an one is expressed by this word. (c) Apud Bochart. Hierozoic. par. 2. l. 5. c. 17. col. 785. Geneva Study BibleThe sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.",
