In Ireland, for instance, it is not so long ago since one of these blood feuds in the county Tipperary had acquired such formidable proportions that the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church there were compelled to resort to a mission in order to put an end to it. A man had been killed nearly a century before in an affray which commenced about the age of a colt. His relatives felt bound to avenge the murder, and their vengeance was again deemed to require fresh vengeance, until faction fights between the \"Three-Year-Olds\" and the \"Four-Year-Olds\" had grown almost into petty wars.

Yet for the offence of wilful murder the penalties enjoined by the Jewish law were terribly severe.
