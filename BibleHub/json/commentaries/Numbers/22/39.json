See what need we have to pray every day, Our Father which art in heaven, lead us not into temptation.

The sacrifices were not so much thank-offerings for Balaam's happy arrival, as supplicatory offerings for the success of the undertaking before them. \"This is evident,\" as Hengstenberg correctly observes, \"from the place and time of their presentation; for the place was not that where Balak first met with Balaam, and they were only presented on the eve of the great event.\" Moreover, they were offered unquestionably not to the Moabitish idols, from which Balak expected no help, but to Jehovah, whom Balak wished to draw away, in connection with Balaam, from His own people (Israel), that he might secure His favour to the Moabites. The situation of Kirjath-Chuzoth, which is only mentioned here, cannot be determined with absolute certainty. As Balak went with Balaam to Bamoth-baal on the morning following the sacrificial meal, which was celebrated there, Kirjath-Chuzoth cannot have been very far distant.
