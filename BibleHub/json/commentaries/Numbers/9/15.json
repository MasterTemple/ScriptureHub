The cloud did not cover the whole structure, but the \"tent of the testimony,\" i. e. the enclosure which contained the \"ark of the testimony\" Exodus 25:16, Exodus 25:22, and the holy place. The phenomenon is now again described in connection with the journeyings which are to be narrated in the sequel of the book. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible CommentaryNu 9:15-23. A Cloud Guides the Israelites.15. the cloud covered the tabernacle—The inspired historian here enters on an entirely new subject, which might properly have formed a separate chapter, beginning at this verse and ending at Nu 10:29 [Calmet]. The cloud was a visible token of God's special presence and guardian care of the Israelites (Ex 14:20; Ps 105:39). It was easily distinguishable from all other clouds by its peculiar form and its fixed position; for from the day of the completion of the tabernacle it rested by day as a dark, by night as a fiery, column on that part of the sanctuary which contained the ark of the testimony (Le 16:2).Matthew Poole's Commentary 1490 Of the cloud, see  Exodus 13:21. The tabernacle, namely,  the tent of the testimony,  or, the tabernacle towards or above the tent of the testimony, i.e. that part of the tabernacle in which was the testimony, or the ark of the testimony; for there the cloudy pillar stood,  Leviticus 16:2. This was an evident token of God’s special presence with and providence over them. See  Exodus 14:20,24 Psa 105:39. And this cloud was easily distinguished from other clouds, both by its peculiar figure and by its constant residence in that place. The appearance of fire;  that they might better discern it, and direct themselves and their journeys or stations by it. Gill's Exposition of the Entire BibleAnd on the day that the tabernacle was reared up,.... Which was the first day of the first month in the second year of the people of Israel's coming out of Egypt, Exodus 40:1, the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony; that part of the tabernacle in which the testimony was, that is, where the ark was, in which the law was put, called the testimony; and this was the most holy place; and over the tent or covering of that was this cloud, which settled upon it, as Ben Gersom thinks, after the seven days of the consecration of Aaron and his sons; on the eighth day, when it was said unto the people of Israel, \"today will the Lord appear unto you\", Leviticus 9:1; \"and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you\", Leviticus 9:6; and here the Targum of Jonathan calls this cloud the cloud of glory, because of the glory of God in it; of which see Exodus 40:34, and at even there was upon the tabernacle, as it were, the appearance of fire until the morning; the same phenomenon, which looked like a cloud in the daytime, appeared like fire in the same place in the nighttime, throughout the whole of it until morning light, when it was seen as a cloud again: this was a token of the presence of God with the people of Israel, of his protection of them, and being a guide unto them by night and day, while in the wilderness; and was a figure of his being the same to his church and people, in the present state of things; see Isaiah 4:5. Geneva Study BibleAnd on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the {g} appearance of fire, until the morning.(g) Like a pillar, read Ex 13:21,22.",

This cloud had come down upon the dwelling when the tabernacle was erected, whilst the glory of the Lord filled the holy of holies (Exodus 40:34-38). In Numbers 9:15 the historian refers to this fact, and then describes more fully what had been already briefly alluded to in Exodus 40:36-37, namely, that when the cloud rose up from the dwelling of the tabernacle it was a sign for removing, and when it came down upon the dwelling, a sign for encamping. In Numbers 9:15, \"on the day of the setting up of the dwelling,\" Exodus 40:34-35, is resumed; and in Numbers 9:15 the appearance of the cloud during the night, from evening till morning, is described in accordance with Exodus 40:38.

In the place of \"dwellings of the tent of witness,\" we have \"dwelling of witness\" (testimony) in Numbers 10:11, and \"tent of witness\" in Numbers 18:2; Numbers 17:8, to denote the whole dwelling, as divided into the holy place and the holy of holies, and not the holy of holies alone. This is unmistakeably evident from a comparison of the verse before us with Exodus 40:34, according to which the cloud covered not merely one portion of the tabernacle, but the whole of the tent of meeting (ohel mod). The rendering, \"the cloud covered the dwelling at the tent of witness,\" i.e., at that part of it in which the witness (or \"testimony\") was kept, viz., the holy of holies, which Rosenmller and Knobel adopt, cannot be sustained, inasmuch as ל has no such meaning, but simply conveys the idea of motion and passage into a place or condition (cf.
