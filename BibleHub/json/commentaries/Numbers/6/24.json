Calovii Bibl. illustr. ad h. l.). There is truth in this, though the grounds assigned seem faulty.

Luther refers the first blessing to \"bodily life and good.\" The blessing, he says, desired for the people \"that God would give them prosperity and every good, and also guard and preserve them.\" This is carried out still further, in a manner corresponding to his exposition of the first article. The second blessing he refers to \"the spiritual nature and the soul,\" and observes, \"Just as the sun, when it rises and diffuses its rich glory and soft light over all the world, merely lifts up its face upon all the world;...so when God gives His word, He causes His face to shine clearly and joyously upon all minds, and makes them joyful and light, and as it were new hearts and new men. For it brings forgiveness of sins, and shows God as a gracious and merciful Father, who pities and sympathizes with our grief and sorrow. The third also relates to the spiritual nature and the soul, and is a desire for consolation and final victory over the cross, death, the devil, and all the gates of hell, together with the world and the evil desires of the flesh. The desire of this blessing is, that the Lord God will lift up the light of His word upon us, and so keep it over us, that it may shine in our hearts with strength enough to overcome all the opposition of the devil, death, and sin, and all adversity, terror, or despair.\") ",
