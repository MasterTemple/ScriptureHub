The dual is generally used in connection with objects which are arranged in pairs, either naturally or artificially (Ges. 88, 2). \"His seed\" (i.e., his posterity, not his sowing corn, the introduction of which, in this connection, would, to say the least, be very feeble here) \"is,\" i.e., grows up, \"by many waters,\" that is to say, enjoys the richest blessings (comp.
