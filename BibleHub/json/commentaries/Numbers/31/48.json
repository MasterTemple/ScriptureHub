The oblation they brought for the Lord \"was partly an atonement\" or reparation for their error (Nu 31:14-16), for it could not possess any expiatory virtue, and partly a tribute of gratitude for the stupendous service rendered them. It consisted of the \"spoil,\" which, being the acquisition of individual valor, was not divided like the \"prey,\" or livestock, each soldier retaining it in lieu of pay; it was offered by the \"captains\" alone, whose pious feelings were evinced by the dedication of the spoil which fell to their share.
