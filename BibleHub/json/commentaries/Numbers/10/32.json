It is good having fellowship with those who have fellowship with God. But the things of this world, which are seen, draw strongly from the pursuit of the things of the other world, which are not seen. Moses urges that Hobab might be serviceable to them. Not to show where they must encamp, nor what way they must march, the cloud was to direct that; but to show the conveniences of the place they marched through, and encamped in. It well consists with our trust in God's providence, to use the help of our friends.",

And when Hobab declined the request, and said that he should return into his own land, i.e., to Midian at the south-east of Sinai (see at Exodus 2:15 and Exodus 3:1), and to his kindred, Moses repeated the request, \"Leave us not, forasmuch as thou knowest our encamping in the desert,\" i.e., knowest where we can pitch our tents; \"therefore be to us as eyes,\" i.e., be our leader and guide, - and promised at the same time to do him the good that Jehovah would do to them.
