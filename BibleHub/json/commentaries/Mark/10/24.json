The greatest trial of a good man's constancy is, when love to Jesus calls him to give up love to friends and relatives. Even when gainers by Christ, let them still expect to suffer for him, till they reach heaven. Let us learn contentment in a low state, and to watch against the love of riches in a high one. Let us pray to be enabled to part with all, if required, in Christ's service, and to use all we are allowed to keep in his service.",

He and takes off somewhat of the edge of the seventy of the expression, by changing the form of it into the words,\" how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!\" There is some authority for omitting the words. \"for them that trot in riches;\" so to reduce the sentence to the simple form, \"How hard is it to enter into the kingdom of God!\" Such is the reading in the two great uncial manuscripts, the Sinaitic and the Vatican. But on the whole the balance of evidence is in favor of that which was adopted in the Authorized Version, and has been retained by the Revisers of 1881; and it is reasonable to believe that our Lord qualified the former expression, in order to relieve the minds of his amazed disciples.
