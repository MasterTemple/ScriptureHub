He was asked, Art thou the Son of the Blessed? that is, the Son of God. For the proof of his being the Son of God, he refers to his second coming. In these outrages we have proofs of man's enmity to God, and of God's free and unspeakable love to man.",

He might have said plainly, \"I will rise from the dead;\" but he chose to speak as in a parable.
