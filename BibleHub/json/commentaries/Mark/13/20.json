Here we have a prediction of that ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this. Such destruction and desolation, that the like cannot be found in any history. Promises of power to persevere, and cautions against falling away, well agree with each other. But the more we consider these things, the more we shall see abundant cause to flee without delay for refuge to Christ, and to renounce every earthly object, for the salvation of our souls.",

This portion of the prophecy closes, in Luke, with the following vivid and important glance at the subsequent fortunes of the chosen people: \"And they shall fall by the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled\" (Lu 21:24). The language as well as the idea of this remarkable statement is taken from Da 8:10, 13. What, then, is its import here? It implies, first, that a time is coming when Jerusalem shall cease to be \"trodden down of the Gentiles\"; which it was then by pagan, and since and till now is by Mohammedan unbelievers: and next, it implies that the period when this treading down of Jerusalem by the Gentiles is to cease will be when \"the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled\" or \"completed.\" But what does this mean? We may gather the meaning of it from Ro 11:1-36 in which the divine purposes and procedure towards the chosen people from first to last are treated in detail. In Ro 11:25 these words of our Lord are thus reproduced: \"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.\" See the [1493]exposition of that verse, from which it will appear that \"till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in\"—or, in our Lord's phraseology, \"till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled\"—does not mean \"till the general conversion of the world to Christ,\" but \"till the Gentiles have had their full time of that place in the Church which the Jews had before them.\" After that period of Gentilism, as before of Judaism, \"Jerusalem\" and Israel, no longer \"trodden down by the Gentiles,\" but \"grafted into their own olive tree,\" shall constitute, with the believing Gentiles, one Church of God, and fill the whole earth. What a bright vista does this open up!",

On the other hand, the leaders of the factions within slew the men who would have taught them how the siege might be prolonged, burnt the corn which would have enabled them to hold out against the enemy, and abandoned the towers, which were in reality impregnable.

The Romans raged against the Jews as an obstinate and rebellious nation, and would have exterminated them. But \"the Lord\" shortened the time of this frightful catastrophe, for the elect's sake, that is, partly for the sake of the Christians who could not escape from Jerusalem, and partly for that of the Jews, who, subdued by this awful visitation, were converted to Christ or would hereafter be converted to him We learn from hence how great is the love of God towards his elect, and his care for them. For their sakes he spared many Jews. For their sakes he created and preserves the whole world. Yea, for their sakes, Christ the eternal Son was made man, and became obedient unto death. \"All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is ",
