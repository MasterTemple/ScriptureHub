The former interpretation is open to the objection, that we cannot possibly imagine why Amos should have formed a word of his own, and one which never occurs again in the Hebrew language, to express the simple idea of a mountain or high land; and the second to this objection, that \"the citadel\" would require something to designate it as a citadel or fortress in the land of the enemy.
