Of these, now so luxurious, soon but a remnant shall be left by the foe. The destruction of Damascus and that of Samaria shall be conjoined; as here their luxurious lives, and subsequently under Pekah and Rezin their inroads on Judah, were combined (Isa 7:1-8; 8:4, 9; 17:3). The parallelism of \"Samaria\" to \"Damascus,\" and the Septuagint favor English Version rather than Gesenius: \"on a damask couch.\" The Hebrew pointing, though generally expressing damask, may express the city \"Damascus\"; and many manuscripts point it so. Compare for Israel's overthrow, 2Ki 17:5, 6; 18:9-12.",
