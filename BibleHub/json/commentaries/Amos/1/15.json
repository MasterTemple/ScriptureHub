When \"he and his princes\" were \"gone into captivity,\" there was no one to make head against the conqueror, and renew revolts. Hence, as a first step in the subdual, the reigning head and those who shared his counsels were removed. Ammon then, savage as it was in act, was no ill-organized horde. On the contrary, barren and waste as all that country now is, it must once have been highly cultivated by a settled and laborious people. The abundance of its ruins attests the industry and habits of the population. \"The whole of the country,\" says Burckhardt , \"must have been extremely well cultivated, to have afforded subsistence to the inhabitants of so many towns.\" \"The low hills are, for the most part, crowned with ruins.\" Of the  \"thirty ruined or deserted places, which including Amman,\" have been even lately \"counted east of Assalt\" (the village which probably represents Ramoth-Gilead, \"about 16 miles west of Philadelphia  that is, Amman) several are in Ammonitis.

There was not a tree in sight as far as the eye could reach; but my guide, who had been over every part of it, assured me that the whole of the plain was covered with the finest soil, and capable of being made the most productive grain-land in the world - For a space of more than thirty miles there did not appear to me a single interruption of hill, rock or wood, to impede immediate tillage.",
