To know his motive or motives, we must know his whole character, which we do not. Amaziah, failing of his purpose, uses his name as far as he dares. \"Seer, go flee thee.\" He probably uses the old title for a prophet, in reference to the visions which he had just related. Perhaps, he used it in irony also . \"Thou who seest, as thou deemest, what others see not, \"visionary! visionist!\" flee thee,\" that is, for thy good; (he acts the patron and the counselor;) \"to the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and there prophesy.\" Worldly people always think that those whose profession is religious make \"a gain of godliness.\" \"He is paid for it,\" they say. \"Whose bread I eat, his song I sing.\" Interested people cannot conceive of one disinterested; nor the worldly, of one unworldly; nor the insincere, of one sincere. Amaziah thought then that Amos, coming out of Judah, must he speaking in the interests of Judah; perhaps, that he was in the pay of her king. Anyhow, prophecies, such as his against Israel, would be acceptable there and be well paid. The words are courteous, like so much patronizing language now, as to God or His revelation, His prophets or His Apostles, or His divine word. The words are measured: the meaning blasphemy.
